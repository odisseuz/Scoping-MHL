	abstract = {To address the urgent need for effective adolescent mental health support, this systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the impact of mental health literacy interventions on adolescents, a group highly susceptible to mental health issues. In accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and registered under the International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (INPLASY202330098), our research thoroughly searched prominent databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO, CNKI, Wanfang, and Chongqing VIP. We focused on studies employing a pre-test-post-test design to compare mental health literacy interventions against control groups. Our analysis included 18 studies revealing statistically significant improvements in adolescents' mental health literacy, knowledge, and help-seeking and a reduction in stigma associated with mental health issues. The effectiveness of these interventions varied significantly across regions, with notable improvements in Asia, particularly in terms of help-seeking and stigma reduction. Interventions featuring frequent interactions proved particularly effective, showing significant increases in mental health knowledge and help-seeking. Multifaceted interventions that combined various methods were most beneficial for enhancing mental health knowledge. Importantly, although the positive effects on mental health literacy and stigma reduction were sustained at the 2-month follow-up, the improvements in help-seeking did not maintain significant levels post-intervention. These findings emphasize the critical need for tailored mental health literacy programs for adolescents and provide novel insights into the efficacy of interactive and diverse intervention strategies.},

Several states have added policies requiring mental health education, yet these vary widely and barriers to operationalization exist. Purpose: This paper explores the onerous landscape of mental health education and makes the case for the education framework of mental health literacy (MHL), derived from health literacy (HL), as the North Star of universal mental health education. Methods: A scan of mental health education policies was conducted, and two state case studies were included. California requires middle- and high-school integration with existing health education, and Delaware requires K-12 mental health education allowing for integration with existing social, emotional, and behavioral wellbeing initiatives within schools' multi-tiered system of supports. Results: Thirty-six state policies were identified, with over 80\% explicitly related to health education. Policies varied across multiple dimensions including scope and clarity, target audience, requirement conditions, and resources. Discussion: Barriers and opportunities are discussed, including a national effort, The Mental Health Literacy Collaborative (MHLC), focused on the benefits of MHL education. Translation to Health Education Practice: Findings offer health educator opportunities for planning, leadership, and advocacy toward implementing MHL education in schools.},

Young adolescents are an ideal target given their need for and receptivity toward MHL education. Methods: We conducted a scoping review to identify universal, school-based MHL programs primarily for students aged 10-14 years, with adequate descriptions of curriculum implementation and content, and measured outcomes. Findings: Thirty-one articles describing 24 programs met the inclusion criteria. The content and educational strategies varied, with no two programs having the same curriculum. The studies show promising results for improvement in mental health knowledge, attitudes, help-seeking, and student mental health. Implications for School Health Policy, Practice, and Equity: Collaborative work between educational and mental health professionals, along with rigorous study of outcomes, aiming to reach a consensus on a core MHL curriculum and best implementation practices, will advance efforts to improve MHL. Conclusions: This scoping review confirmed that existing universal, school-based MHL programs for middle school-aged students improve mental health knowledge. The programs are diverse, and their outcomes are often challenging to compare. Ongoing study in this field to optimize design and implementation for improved effectiveness is needed.},

	abstract = {Background: School-based mental health services, particularly when integrated into multi-tiered systems of support (MTSS), offer an evidence-based strategy for primary and secondary prevention and targeted intervention for students' mental health challenges. Team-based decision-making is at the center of successful MTSS, but the mental health literacy of school staff on these teams is unknown. Purpose: The current study aims to describe the state of MTSS team members' mental health literacy and evaluate how mental health literacy components are related to one another. Methods: We measured the mental health literacy of MTSS team members (N = 58; 59\% White; 92\% female) from nine elementary schools, including their understanding of students' mental health in the school context and their willingness to promote it. Results: MTSS team members reported more positive than negative mental health literacy, and mental health literacy constructs were predictably and positively interrelated. Discussion: Overall, the group appeared to favor approaches aligned with school-based mental health and social, emotional, and behavioral MTSS. Future research should replicate study results with a larger sample in order to increase the precision of the estimates and confirm the pattern of findings. Translation to Health Education Practice: MTSS team members typically demonstrate an understanding of students' underlying mental health needs in the context of school and a personal and organizational willingness to address those needs. Staff training and system-level changes would likely further improve mental health literacy, with anticipated positive impacts on school-based mental health and MTSS outcomes.},

This study aims to develop a training module named MDAS (Mental Health disorder, Developmental disorders, Attachment and Self-compassionate) program to improve the school counsellors' mental health knowledge and counselling self-efficacy. The Module was adapted from Child and Adolescent Mental Health Training Module for Specialist 2009 (Second Edition). The study adopted a one group pre-test/post-test design to assess 28 school counsellors at 0-month and 4-month after the training. The scales used were Counselling Self-Efficacy scale (COSE), Mental Health Literacy Scale (MHLS) and Self-Compassionate Scale -- Short Form (SCS-SF). Post-training, there were significant increment of COSE and MHLS scores (p {\textless} 0.001 and p {\textless} 0.046) with Cohen's d of 1.01 and 0.58. Four of the COSE subscales (micro skills, counselling process, cultural competence and dealing with difficult clients' behaviour) significantly increased after MDAS training (p {\textless} 0.001, p = 0.006, p = 0.001 and p = 0.01). In addition to increasing the counselling capacity of school counsellors, our training module can serve as a promising platform for mental health professionals and counsellors.},

The peer-led lessons cover defining good and bad mental health, risk and protective factors, self-care, help-seeking and looking after one another. While previous pre-post evaluations have suggested effectiveness, the mechanisms through which the intervention improves mental health literacy remain unclear. We purposively recruited seven secondary schools across England from 2020 to 2022 and collected data through five observations, 12 staff interviews and 15 student focus groups (totalling 134 students; 46 peer educators aged 14-18 years and 88 peer learners aged 11-13 years). Our realist analysis adopted retroductive logic, intertwining deductive and inductive approaches to test the initial programme theory against insights arising from the data. We developed Context - Mechanisms - Outcome configurations related to four themes: (i) modelling behaviours and forming supportive relationships, (ii) relevant and appropriate content, (iii) peer educators feeling empowered and (iV) a school culture that prioritises mental health support. Our refined programme theory highlights key mechanisms, contexts conducive to achieving the outcomes and ways to improve training, recruitment and delivery to maximise effectiveness for similar peer-led initiatives.},

We aimed to determine whether a mental health literacy (MHL) intervention was effective at improving MHL for staff in an urban, predominately Latinx elementary school. A pre/post quasi-experimental design was used. A 20-week MHL intervention that is comprehensive (i.e., not disorder specific) and tiered (i.e., universal as well as targeted services for those with greater needs) was provided as part of an existing school-based mental health prevention and promotion program. A survey adapted from validated measures of MH knowledge and attitudes (including self-efficacy and stigma), as well as use of student support services, was simultaneously administered to staff at the intervention school and a matched comparison school before and after the intervention. Linear and logistic regressions assessed whether changes in MHL and rates of MH referrals varied by school. After controlling for pre-intervention scores, staff in the intervention school had significantly higher knowledge scores (data), higher self-efficacy scores (data), and lower stigma scores (data) in the post-intervention period compared to the comparison school. Following the intervention, more staff in the intervention school reported utilizing student supports to discuss student needs (OR 5.8, 95\% CI 2.3-14.6). This intervention, which utilizes a social-ecological framework and tiered approach, led to improvements in MHL of school staff, which may facilitate staff ability to identify and support students' MH needs.},

	abstract = {There is increasing interest in the role sports coaches are expected to play in supporting the mental health of elite and sub-elite athletes. This paper presents the first single-sport, mixed-methods, study of UK athletics coaches' mental health literacy (MHL). We extend previous quantitative survey-based UK studies by incorporating the qualitative lived experiences of coaches into the analysis. We explore coaches' knowledge of mental health and illness, experience of mental health training, and willingness to support athletes with mental illness. An online survey of 184 UK athletics coaches revealed that MHL was highest among women, younger coaches, and coaches with less experience. No statistical differences were found between MHL score and disability, sexuality or region in which coaches worked. Interviews held with a sub-sample of 25 survey respondents revealed a lack of clear consensus about what constitutes mental health and mental illness, and that coaches' everyday views of these did not always correspond with formal definitions or conceptualisations. Coaches' views were instead typically characterised by dominant psychological and psychiatric understandings of mental health and illness, while the significance of social relations and inequalities were often overlooked. There was a general willingness among coaches to support athlete mental health as an aspect of their duty of care, but most lacked the relevant training and understanding to do so effectively because such training was not implemented systematically within their organisational practice. Coaches' call for mandatory athletics-specific mental health training was one strategy thought to better enhance coaches' skills, knowledge and intentions to provide and seek mental health support. Important though MHL training and other sources of support is, we conclude that this is likely insufficient on its own and that there is a parallel need for multi-level, systems-wide, approaches in sport and wider society to better support the mental health of everyone.},

	abstract = {In recent years, there has been a notable increase in the prevalence of deliberate self-harm (DSH) among adolescents, which has led to the recognition of this issue as a significant public health challenge. However, school-based prevention programmes for DSH remain scarce. This study aimed to develop, implement, and evaluate the effectiveness of the Healthy Minds programme, a universal school-based prevention intervention targeting DSH in adolescents. Conducted in a Lisbon school, the programme sought to reduce DSH and suicidal ideation, change beliefs about DSH, and promote help-seeking. A quasi-experimental design with experimental and control groups included 137 participants aged 13-19 (M = 14.73; SD = 1.03), assessed at three time points: pre-intervention, post-intervention, and follow-up. The intervention showed partial effectiveness, with delayed reductions in DSH and significant improvements in reducing false beliefs. In addition, both groups showed increased help-seeking behaviours, and these effects were sustained over the follow-up period, suggesting long-term effectiveness. However, no significant improvements were observed in the ability to recognise warning signs of DSH, nor were there reductions in levels of suicidal ideation. The Healthy Minds programme shows promise in reducing DSH, improving mental health literacy and promoting help-seeking behaviours in adolescents, with sustained benefits observed over time. These findings highlight the importance of implementing well-structured, methodologically robust school-based interventions aimed at preventing DSH in this population. To maximise programme effectiveness, longer follow-up periods and more integrated, multifaceted approaches are essential.},

	abstract = {The rates of death by suicide and the prevalence of mental health conditions in children and youth are a world-wide crisis. Education and school health promotion have a key role in supporting children, however initiatives and interventions are siloed and provide supports to only a few students. In this qualitative study with quantitative components, I used a sequential exploratory research design in a three-phase process to explore how promoting a universal approach to mental health literacy (MHL) and social emotional learning (SEL) in the context of health education can bridge the suicide prevention gap that exists in elementary education. Phase one included an artifact analysis of state and district-level data addressing health education, SEL, and MHL. In phase two, I presented the findings from my artifact analysis to a district-level team. They were then asked to provide feedback on adaptations to a district revision of CDC's Elementary School Health Index (SHI) to better support district and school-level goals (CDC, 2017). The data were collected and shared with the participants through a focus group in phase three, where they continued revising in a collaborative format. The process of adapting the SHI provided insight into how educators perceive the constructs in this study. I selected a purposeful sampling of district-level staff to participate in the survey and focus group. District-level staff were chosen based on their expertise and experience with SEL, mental health, health education, and/or intimate knowledge of student needs. All 20 participants held leadership or support positions in the district. Participants were female and four racial/ethnic groups were represented. The findings highlight the multidimensional nature of these topics. There was a general consensus that health education, MHL, and SEL can and should be aligned, but there are many factors to consider along the way to alignment. Participants spoke about professional development, accountability, equity, access, cultural responsiveness, collaboration, responsibility, roles, implementation, systems, and more. Implications for practice and suggestions for future research are discussed. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

Four global barrier themes were identified, namely: stigma; practical barriers; negative attitudes and perceptions; and knowledge barriers. Two global facilitator themes also emerged, including: mental health literacy; and wellbeing and community factors. The findings highlight important implications for improving help-seeking behaviours in adolescents, including increasing mental health support in school. The findings are discussed relative to the role of the educational psychologist (EP), as EPs are well-positioned to support universal and targeted approaches that endeavour to reduce stigma, enhance service accessibility, promote connectedness, and improve mental health literacy.},

Participants shared culture-specific risk factors for these mental health disorders, such as high academic pressure, sociocultural pressures for thinness, and internalized model minority stereotype. Participants also proposed strategies to support youth mental health, including providing support, encouraging professional help-seeking, reducing stigma, addressing confidentiality concerns, implementing school-wide programs to promote mental health awareness, promoting positive coping strategies, and establishing strong connections between mental health providers and Asian American students.

@phdthesis{brenner_stigma_2024,
	title = {Stigma, {Mental} {Health} {Knowledge}, and {Help}-{Seeking} in a {Sample} of {Jewish} {High} {School} {Students}},
	abstract = {This dissertation investigates the relationship between stigma, knowledge, and help-seeking attitudes among high school students in two New York City Jewish day schools: a Modern Orthodox all-boys high school and a Sephardic Orthodox Jewish all-girls high school. The primary focus is on understanding how these factors: stigma about mental illness and knowledge about mental health, predict student attitudes about seeking help for mental health issues. Utilizing a quantitative survey methodology, the study gathered data from approximately 150 students, with more participants from the boys' school than the girls' school. The survey assessed levels of mental health knowledge, perceived stigma associated with mental health issues, and attitudes toward seeking help. The results indicate an inverse relationship between perceived stigma and help-seeking attitudes, with higher levels of stigma correlating with lower propensities to seek help. Conversely, increased knowledge about mental health issues was positively associated with more favorable help-seeking attitudes. The discussion section elaborates on these findings, exploring the implications of the observed relationships. It also addresses the limitations of the study, including the potential for self-report biases and the restricted generalizability due to the specific demographic and religious context of the sample. Future research directions are suggested, emphasizing the need for longitudinal studies and interventions tailored to the unique cultural contexts of these populations. Policy and practice implications are provided, particularly for educators and mental health practitioners working within Orthodox Jewish communities. There is a critical need for targeted educational initiatives to reduce stigma and enhance mental health literacy, thereby fostering a more supportive environment for help-seeking behaviors. Ideally, schools should integrate mental health education into their curricula and provide accessible resources that align with the cultural and religious values of their students. By addressing stigma and improving mental health knowledge, it is possible to create environments that support the mental well-being and academic success of these students.

	abstract = {This study evaluated the impact of a somatic wellness training pilot program specifically designed for marriage and family therapy (MFT) students. Anchored in mindfulness and the person of the therapist (POTT) model, the program aimed to cultivate heightened self-awareness, emotional regulation, and self-care practices, incorporating respect for cultural diversity. This pilot addressed a notable gap in existing MFT literature, drawing inspiration from the observed benefits of similar training in disciplines such as psychology and social work. Participants included 10 clinically active MFT students who were currently enrolled in master's or doctoral programs. The participants took part in a pilot somatic wellness training program that incorporated experiential exercises, ethical considerations, practical application of tools and resources, and discussions about self-care and wellness. Quantitative outcomes were measured using pre- and post-training Likert assessments, which demonstrated significant improvements in interoceptive awareness and body awareness. Qualitative data gathered from participant feedback highlighted the value of self-care practices, shared narratives, and the practical application of training concepts in enhancing personal and professional wellness. The study's findings indicate that somatic wellness training can benefit MFT students by improving key therapeutic skills and personal well-being. These improvements suggest that such training should be integrated into MFT curricula to better equip therapists for the multifaceted challenges of their profession and to support their sustainability in the field. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on the necessity of holistic training approaches in mental health education and underscores the potential for future studies to explore broader applications and long-term effects of somatic wellness training. The integration of these findings into educational policies could foster a new generation of therapists who are better prepared both personally and professionally.

Social work programs play a significant role in preparing the future of the profession and must consider infusing content into the curriculum to enhance students' knowledge and skills. Using a mixed methods design, this study utilized three separate strands of data to understand how social work program curriculum is designed to support students in acquiring the knowledge and skills to work with the ADHD population. The Knowledge of Attention Deficit Disorders Scale (KADDS) and Community Attitudes Towards Mental Illness Scale (CAMI) were utilized to explore the knowledge and attitudes of social work students regarding ADHD. Qualitative interviews were conducted to understand the perceptions of social work program directors, and content analysis of course syllabi of social work programs were examined to illustrate how social work programs infuse mental health and ADHD-specific content into the curriculum. Several themes emerged from the data that were synonymous with the integrating features of the Signature Pedagogy Framework including thinking and performing like a social worker, development of the professional self, and signature characteristics of teaching and learning. By incorporating a multidimensional approach in understanding the integrative structures that inform social work education and practice, this research validated the strengths and limitations of the existing pedagogical framework.

	abstract = {Social-Emotional Learning (SEL), the process of developing and utilizing interpersonal skills for everyday life, has become a primary vehicle for structuring students' social and emotional health in the United States and across the world. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of understanding SEL practices, is increasingly at the forefront of many discussions in education today. Since "non-academic factors" like SEL were added to U.S. education law (ESSA, 2015), the state of Florida has also added two mandates concerning SEL (Florida Senate Bill 7026: The Marjorie Stoneman Douglas Act and FS 1003.42; Rule 6A-1.094121: Curriculum mandate for four hours of SEL as part of mental health education). This has led to the adoption of SEL programming in schools. In 2018, Martin County Public Schools adopted the BASE Education learning program, an SEL approach that aimed to help high school students, identified as at-risk after a discipline infraction, to "learn about and apply psycho-social concepts through supportive, therapeutic dialogue" (MCSD Code of Conduct, Chapter V, 2022, p.18). BASE Education is an online program currently being implemented in all high schools within the Martin County School District. In purchasing BASE for implementation into the disciplinary process and SEL supports, the district projected that BASE Education would increase self-awareness and increase responsible decision making, thus decreasing discipline referrals. This study examines two components of the disciplinary experience of MCSD students: (1) The SEL experience of high school students referred to BASE Education intervention programming in the Martin County School District, and (2) How students who have participated in [personalized] BASE Education modules describe the nature of their pathway within the online experience. This study represents the first time that an analysis of the student referral experience data and online SEL intervention experiential pathway program data has been undertaken in Martin County Public Schools.

Timely referral to intervention and support services for ASD has consistently demonstrated significant long-term positive effects on symptoms and subsequent skills and family outcomes. This paper highlights a novel and innovative approach of short-term consultations for best practices to ultimately increase access to timely ASD evaluations and support through a state-wide school telehealth initiative. The goal of the initiative was to facilitate rapid access to ASD evaluation and support (within 2 weeks of referral in school-age youth) among under-resourced school systems in Central Texas. First, this paper provides background relative to current disparities that many children face when attempting to obtain ASD evaluations and support. Second, a statewide legislative response is described that created a mental health consortium targeting increased access to broad-based mental health services and supports, particularly in underserved areas. Next, the Texas Child Health Access Through Telemedicine (TCHATT) program is outlined with a particular focus on day-to-day operationality and concentrated efforts to increase mental health literacy among school teams relative to ASD symptoms and co-occurring behavioral health concerns. Year 1 utilization data metrics (September 2020-May 2021) and representative case examples are presented. Finally, early "lessons learned" and future directions are discussed.},

	abstract = {The qualitative study examined the mental health aspects of marginalized elementary school students in addition to constructing and implementing a culturally responsive and sustaining mindfulness program to observe if there were improvements regarding emotional regulation and awareness. To achieve this, I constructed a culturally responsive and sustaining mindfulness program, implemented this program, and studied the responses from students. The research questions that fueled this study include: (1) What types of negative emotions do marginalized elementary students experience? What is the root cause for marginalized students experiencing negative emotions during their elementary school years? (2) How can incorporating mindfulness techniques embedded with culturally responsive and sustaining pedagogies aid marginalized students in overcoming negative emotions that they experience in elementary school? (3) How can culturally responsive mindfulness programs be sustainable and transformative for marginalized students who frequently encounter negative emotions? (4) What challenges and difficulties are there in developing and implementing such a program? How do I search for and implement solutions? The results from this study showed that the majority of marginalized students consistently felt negative emotions at school, including overwhelming stress caused by academic pressure, nervousness due to previous trauma related to bullying, and anger due to disliking school for numerous reasons. Additionally, creating such a program that incorporated mindfulness and culturally responsive and sustaining pedagogies positively impacted students, equipping them with critical reflection skills to discover new techniques to help them overcome negative emotions and build resilience. The main challenge I faced as the researcher when constructing and implementing such a program was ensuring the program incorporated effective and meaningful activities that embraced all student cultures.

	title = {Using {Classroom} {WISE} to {Empower} {Paraprofessionals} {Working} with {Students} with {Special} {Needs}},
	abstract = {Paraprofessionals are a primary resource in special education. National data show that the number of individuals serving in the paraprofessional role continues to increase across the United States, alongside the complexity of the role itself. Educational entities have provided guidance on the competencies paraprofessionals should obtain prior to serving in their role; however, available professional development fails to align with this guidance. Research shows that paraprofessionals lack role clarity, feel ineffective, are undervalued, and are emotionally exhausted by their work. Moreover, studies show that their performance in their role and perception of their work are heavily impacted by inadequate training and limited supervision. To address these limitations, the current study evaluated the Classroom Well-Being Information and Strategies for Educators (Classroom WISE) modules developed by the Mental Health Technology Transfer Center Network (MHTTC) and the National Center for School Mental Health (NCSMH) and its impact on paraprofessional awareness and knowledge of concepts and strategies to support student mental health. Classroom WISE is a free, three-part mental health literacy training package that includes an online course, video library, and resource collection. Study participants completed a pre-survey and six module quizzes comprised of Likert scale items, multiple-choice questions, and open-ended questions. These items, adopted from MHTTC and NCSMH, assessed content knowledge, comprehension of the module content, perception of importance and preparedness of skill targets, and participants' overall perception of the Classroom WISE modules. Quantitative data analysis and qualitative coding were utilized to evaluate outcomes. The findings include endorsement of the Classroom WISE modules by participants, increased knowledge of relevant concepts and strategies that can be used within the classroom environment, enhanced understanding of students, and relevant self-reflection of educators. The Classroom WISE modules proved to be an effective and efficient way to enhance the evidence-based training available to educators. Including these modules in training pathways for paraprofessionals can promote a greater understanding of how to respond to and support student needs in their classrooms.

Results: Findings from this study indicate that students who perceived the benefits of scaffolded simulation activities (i.e., peer observations, debriefings, and self-reflections) were more likely to engage in this deep learning process, which in turn led to their higher confidence in clinical reasoning, clinical judgment, and critical thinking skills. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that scaffolded simulations in psychiatric clinical settings, coupled with the novice to expert model in nursing education, are a valuable tool for preparing nursing students for the rigors of clinical practice, despite decreased in-person client experiences in nursing programs. Implications: This study has implications for designing and implementing scaffolded clinical simulations that foster clinical judgment and help students perform tasks with which they are already familiar, while new responsibilities are introduced throughout the semester.},

	abstract = {The Empowering Children with Hope and Opportunity (ECHO) program has collected data for 20 years. The ECHO staff has fallen short in using this data to clearly demonstrate any impacts and to engage in continuous improvement of the ECHO organization. Thus, the purpose of the current research project is to demonstrate how effective the counseling, social work, or social and emotional curriculum components are in the ECHO program. An embedded mixed method design was used to explore the impact ECHO counseling services has on student behavior and academic achievement, the effect the ECHO Family Advocacy program has on family stabilization, and if students are applying the skills learned from the social-emotional curriculum, Second Step®. The ECHO counseling services assisted in improving the teaching and learning climate and addressing the increase in student mental health needs. The interviews with the principals and parents demonstrated the success of students by sharing improvement with academics and behavior. The ECHO Family Advocacy program demonstrated a positive relationship with family stabilization by providing families with the resources needed or assisting them in making goals for themselves. The social and emotional learning curriculum, Second Step® data demonstrated no change from the pre and post assessment. There was no significant change in Skills for Learning, Empathy and Emotional Management, and Problem Solving. The findings of this study demonstrate the wide initiative for mental health education, a parent education program, and a data driven social and emotional learning curriculum to improve the impact of ECHO's services.

	abstract = {Trauma-informed care (TIC) stands as a beacon of transformative change within healthcare organizations, advocating for consistent practice models and bolstering mental health education across diverse settings (Bunting et al., 2019). For registered nurses (RNs) operating in the high-pressure environment of emergency departments (EDs), TIC emerges as a guiding principle, aiming to cultivate care practices that alleviate patient trauma and safeguard against retraumatization of patients and staff (Fleishman et al., 2019). This research investigated the importance of providing trauma-informed education to RNs in EDs, focusing on RNs' perspectives. The study used qualitative narrative inquiry research design to explore RNs' perceptions of TIC continuing education initiatives led by organizational leadership, particularly in enhancing organizational outcomes. The study highlights the critical need for ongoing education, especially given the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the experiences of RNs in the field. This study emphasizes its significance in improving organizational outcomes and patient care quality by contributing to the existing body of research on TIC education. Recommendations stemming from this research include integrating TIC education into nursing curricula, offering online training, promoting collaboration across healthcare disciplines, and establishing institutional policies supportive of TIC principles. Drawing from the TIC conceptual framework and the implications of this study, future research directions are proposed, including investigating the impact of TIC training on nursing practice in person and online, identifying obstacles to TIC implementation, and exploring TIC's potential in addressing healthcare disparities.},

	abstract = {This paper examines ideas about mental health, wellbeing and school education to illustrate important issues in the relationship between mental health and education. The COVID crisis has amplified the pre-existing mental health problems of children and young people in England and recognition of the opportunities in schools to address these. The paper gives an overview of child and adolescent mental health services and how they position the role of schools. It examines prominent concepts of mental health and their relationship to wellbeing, setting this in a discussion of 'mentally healthy' schools, mental health in special educational needs and whole-school approaches. This analysis shows how the relationship between mental health and wellbeing has not been adequately worked out, using this as the basis for arguing for the dual-factor mental health model which separates mental illness/disorder from wellbeing as two related dimensions. The paper then translates the dual-factor model into a two-dimensional framework that represents the distinctive but related aims of school education (wellbeing promotion) and mental health services (preventing, coping, helping mental health difficulties). This framework involves a complex conception of wellbeing, with schools playing an important role in promoting wellbeing (beyond emotional wellbeing), tiered models and establishing school-wide social emotional learning. It is about a whole-school curriculum approach that involves considering what is to be learned and how it is taught. It contributes to a more nuanced concept of wellbeing that has a place for meaningful learning and challenge.},

	abstract = {Purpose of review: School-based health centers (SBHCs) primarily serve underserved students and families through removing barriers to care. The number of SBHCs have increased dramatically with investments from state- and federal-funding programs, including expanded funding from the American Rescue Plan. This article reviews findings on the perceived importance of school and community partnership. It also provides a critical review of the evidence base on impact on health, mental health, and education indicators. Recent findings: Recent findings underscore the importance of SBHCs engaging the school and community to build trust while identifying and responding to needs. Engagement supports planning, implementing, and sustaining SBHCs. Studies of impact find that SBHCs increase participation in preventative and routine health and decrease emergency department utilization and hospitalization. However, additional research needs to rigorously test for effects of SBHCs on symptoms and indicators of wellbeing, especially with respect to mental health and education. Summary: SBHCs increase participation of students from marginalized groups in preventative and routine care. School and community engagement are vital aspects of SBHCs, likely removing barriers related to trust. Additional rigorous evidence is needed testing efficacy of SBHCs when it comes to improving health, mental health, and education.

	abstract = {This paper examines the official pedagogic discourse communicating the explicit inclusion of Mental Health (MH) education in Singapore's revised 2021 Character and Citizenship (CCE2021) curriculum within Singapore's state-driven educational context of decentralised centralism. By adapting Basil Bernstein's theoretical work on pedagogic discourse -- using William Tyler's typology of Bernstein's 'Pedagogic Codes' and 'Official Pedagogic Identities' -- our findings reveal how MH in CCE2021 projects different, simultaneous student identities. These include retrospective identities of students as resilient, community-minded citizens; prospective identities of students as vulnerable cyber users requiring explicit guidance for their future-readiness; de-centred therapeutic identities of students as reflective, self-actualising students requiring psychological safety; and de-centred market identities of students as trained advocates and community first responders. Together, they generate a tension where therapeutic identities are positioned as prerequisite to the other identities, subsuming individual well-being within community well-being, and conflating the intrinsic good of personal resilience with instrumental notions of future-readiness. This expresses a paradox where state-student social relations are both transformed and continued, as concerns of student confidentiality and efficacy of help-seeking efforts persist. Overall, we contend the educational reform of MH in CCE2021 accommodates rather than reconciles progressive concerns of youth mental health with neoliberal state imperatives.},

@phdthesis{williamson_school_2024,
	title = {School {Psychologists}' {Experiences} and {Roles} in {Trauma}-{Informed} {Practices}},
	abstract = {Due to a wide breadth of training, school psychologists are uniquely qualified to provide indirect and direct services outlined by best practices, such as school-based mental health services, special education evaluations, and trauma-informed practices. Professional standards indicate that school psychologists are equipped to identify trauma response symptoms and provide evidence-based services when supporting students with trauma histories. However, an identified gap between best practices and the present realities of school psychologists' has been identified in the literature. The few studies that explored the experiences of school psychologists endorsed a lack of training and confidence with identifying trauma response symptoms and subsequent trauma-informed services. The present study used a phenomenological qualitative research design using semi-structured interviews to determine the realities of Illinois school psychologists in providing these trauma-informed practices. The results of the present study added to the literature by highlighting eight participants' experiences with learning and implementing trauma-informed care at the graduate and professional level. Key findings suggest that these participants received baseline, or general, knowledge of identifying trauma response symptoms and trauma-informed care through graduate training programs and professional development opportunities offered through their school district and state or national organizations. While these participants reported feeling more confident and prepared in their ability to identify trauma response symptoms, they desired explicit application-based training to better understand how to support students with trauma histories through school-based therapeutic and counseling approaches. Further, these participants highlighted systemic barriers (e.g., resources, school psychologist shortage, limited school-wide knowledge) and facilitators (e.g., team-based support, consultation) that impacted their ability to provide trauma-informed care. The findings obtained from the eight interviews sparked possible implications and future directions for the fields of school psychology and education.

	abstract = {It is challenging to understand the complexity and multiple causes of school violence. Given the apparent rise in many forms of violence in schools, and the dire consequences to those impacted by violence, it is vital to better support children and youth in both preventing violence and responding appropriately. "Issues Around Violence in Schools" explores a number of topics related to violence that occurs in schools or with school-aged children and youth. Authors address the nature and extent of violence in schools -- including mass shootings but also other forms of violence -- and the relationships and intersections among mental health, special education, and school violence in general. They consider positive approaches to mental health, behavior, and overall climate in schools, analysing both disciplinary practices and interventions and supports and their relationship to school violence. Key insights are presented regarding bullying, positive approaches to behavioral and social/emotional concerns, and the promise of threat assessment for mitigating violence and connecting students to needed supports. This volume provides an overview of key areas of promise for improved research and practice, such that schools are better positioned to mitigate violence, and to respond in positive, supportive ways to those who may be impacted by violence.},

	abstract = {At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, it became necessary for community mental health agencies and private mental health practitioners to utilize telemental health services. In reviewing the literature, a gap was identified regarding clinical mental health counselor education programs and teaching strategies utilized by counselor educators. The rationale for this study was to understand how CES faculty describe their teaching strategies for telemental health. A generic qualitative research methodology was used to answer the research study question. The generic qualitative method was chosen for research participants to be given a chance to express themselves freely and gather data through an interview process. The population for the study included counselor educators who held a doctoral degree in counselor education and supervision and have taught in a CACREP-accredited clinical mental health counseling program. The sample consisted of nine counselor educators who participated in a semi-structured interview. The mean number of years the counselor educators had experience was five. Thematic analysis was used to analyze, code, and develop themes from the data transcriptions. The qualitative software MAXQDA was used to aid in the analysis process. The study identified five themes: Literature, Lecture/Discussion, Experiential, Regulatory State Standards of Telemental Health, and Faculty Experience with Telemental Health. The results from the study show that counselor educators are using various teaching strategies for teaching telemental health, including active learning, pedagogical content knowledge, encouraging cognitive complexity, promoting a growth mindset, using students' prior knowledge, and ensuring students are engaging with the subject matter. Counselor educators use these teaching strategies by exposing counselors-in-training to literature and discussion on various telemental health topics, using their knowledge of state regulatory standards and personal use of telemental health, and through hands-on experience through practicum and internships. Further research could focus on counselor education and supervision programs concerning culturally relevant teaching of telemental health, what is being taught in classrooms, and specifics on what skills are needed for telemental health.
