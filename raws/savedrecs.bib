Title = {A critical review of curriculum and pedagogy in mental health education},
Journal = {HEALTH EDUCATION},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 NOV 10},
Abstract = {Purpose - To critically examine the existing literature on mental health
   education in secondary schools amid an escalating youth mental health
   crisis, exploring which curriculum components and pedagogical approaches
   are most effective for adolescents' learning.<br />
   Design/methodology/approach - We used a critical literature review
   methodology grounded in a constructivist paradigm. Systematic searches
   across three databases using the PICo framework yielded 176 publications
   for analysis. Data extraction captured explicit and implicit insights
   about curriculum and pedagogy from diverse publication types. Reflexive
   thematic analysis was conducted using Bernstein's educational theory,
   Freire's critical pedagogy and Kutcher et al.'s mental health literacy
   model as analytical lenses.<br /> Findings - We identified eight
   evidence-based propositions indicating that effective curriculum
   requires comprehensive integration of all mental health literacy
   components, recognition of mental health's subjective nature within
   sociocultural contexts, inclusion of biopsychosocial and continuum
   models and development of communication competencies and practical
   problem-solving skills. From a pedagogical perspective, the findings
   indicate the limitations of didactic methods while supporting multimedia
   integration, active learning methodologies and student-led approaches
   that foster critical engagement and agency.<br /> Originality/value -
   Despite recognition that school-based mental health education is a
   crucial factor in improving adolescent mental health, current approaches
   have been characterised as heterogenous and inconsistent, with ambiguity
   regarding which curriculum components and pedagogical approaches
   contribute to the effectiveness of interventions - a critical gap that
   this review addresses by offering guidance for researchers, educators
   and policymakers to consider in designing and delivering mental health
   education that enhances adolescents' mental health literacy and empowers
   them to improve their well-being.},

Title = {Fostering Mental Health Awareness in Pakistani Adolescents: Results From
   a School-Based Intervention Study},
Journal = {PSYCHOLOGY IN THE SCHOOLS},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 AUG 18},
Abstract = {With significant rates of mental health problems reported among
   adolescents in Pakistan, it is necessary to equip them with mental
   health knowledge for timely detection and intervention. This study
   investigated the effectiveness of the Urdu version of the Mental Health
   and High School Curriculum Guide in improving adolescents' mental health
   literacy. By utilizing quasi experimental research design, a total of
   316 grade nine students from three government high schools in Lahore,
   Pakistan were screened on Urdu Version of Mental Health Literacy Scale.
   From these, 122 participants who scored low were divided into
   intervention group (n = 61) and waitlist control group (n = 61) while
   being matched on gender, age and school variables to limit confounding.
   A total of 78 students (intervention group; n = 42 and waitlist control
   group; n = 36) completed the intervention and post-evaluation.
   Independent Samples t-test revealed that the intervention group
   exhibited improved mental health literacy post-intervention than the
   waitlist control group (t {[}76] = 7.70, p < 0.001, Hedges' g = 1.94).
   The paired samples t-test indicated significant post-intervention
   improvements in the intervention group's mental health literacy (t
   {[}41] = -14.48, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 2.51), mental health knowledge
   (t {[}41] = -10.11, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 1.71), and attitudes (t
   {[}41] = -4.34, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.72). This study had an
   attrition rate of 35.2\% and the differential attrition analysis
   revealed no significant differences between the participants who
   completed the study and those who dropped out. Overall, the present
   study highlights the effectiveness of the guide and underscores the need
   for policy makers to embed such programs in educational curriculum to
   prevent mental health disorders and enhance community outcomes.},

Title = {The DNP Collective Model: Enhancing Mental Health Literacy in Metro
   Detroit},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY HEALTH NURSING},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 NOV 1},
Abstract = {PurposeThe DNP Collective is a structured faculty-Doctor of Nursing
   Practice (DNP) mentorship model developed to implement a large-scale
   quality improvement (QI) initiative aimed at reducing mental health
   disparities, enhancing early intervention skills, and strengthening
   doctoral nursing education. The initiative utilized Mental Health First
   Aid (MHFA), an evidence-based program that teaches participants to
   identify, understand, and respond to signs of mental illness and
   substance use disorders. DesignA QI design combined community-wide MHFA
   dissemination with structured faculty mentorship to ensure training
   fidelity, cultural adaptation, and reflective learning. MethodsBetween
   2022 and 2024, thirteen DNP students, certified as MHFA instructors,
   delivered MHFA training across Michigan communities. Participants
   completed pre- and post-training surveys using the Mental Health
   Literacy Scale (MHLS). Faculty mentors ensured fidelity and cultural
   relevance. Paired t-tests evaluated MHLS score changes, and chi-square
   analyses assessed categorical variables. ResultsA total of 422
   individuals received MHFA training, with 224 matched MHLS surveys.
   Mental health literacy significantly improved, with mean scores
   increasing from 130.6 to 137.7 (p < .001). The greatest gains were
   observed among underserved populations, particularly Hmong and immigrant
   participants with limited prior exposure to mental health education.
   ConclusionsIntegrating MHFA with structured DNP mentorship improved
   community mental health literacy and strengthened student leadership and
   project rigor. This scalable model embeds health equity and public
   health impact within DNP education. Clinical RelevanceFor community
   health nurses, these findings highlight the importance of nursing-led,
   culturally responsive interventions in promoting mental health literacy,
   early intervention, and stigma reduction across diverse populations.},

Abstract = {Background: School-aged children with unidentified mental illnesses
   experience poor health outcomes; managing this issue requires a
   collaborative community approach. Objectives: The objective was to
   implement an evidence-based mental health education and sustainment
   program within an underresourced school setting for staff and
   parents/guardians supervising children to optimize adult mental health
   literacy (MHL). Methods: The intervention included Youth Mental Health
   First Aid (YMHFA) training; measurements of pre- and post-MHL were
   completed with the Mental Health Literacy Scale (MHLS). Sustainment was
   achieved by developing a school-centered mental health toolkit and
   integrating a school champion. Results: There was a significant MHL
   score change from pretest to posttest. The toolkit bolstered
   sustainability by increasing the utilization of community resources.
   Conclusions: This mental health awareness initiative proved effective
   and can be expanded across similar underresourced schools to fill voids.},

Abstract = {Introduction Medical students face a high prevalence of mental
   disorders, such as depression, alongside inadequate mental health
   literacy (MHL). This study investigates the feasibility, and efficacy of
   an interactive, gamified educational program in improving participants'
   MHL. Method Thirty-two Iranian medical students participated in a
   semi-experimental pretest-post-test study. An 18-hour online program,
   delivered using the flipped classroom method, focused on mental health
   first aid, stigma, stress management, and subjective well-being (SWB)
   skills. Participants were evaluated before, after, and four months
   post-program using the Mental Health Literacy Scale (MHLS), Mental
   Health Promoting Knowledge (MHPK), and World Health Organization-5
   Well-being Index (WHO-5). Results Participants' mean age was 22.78 ( +/-
   4.54). Post-test results showed significant improvement in MHLS and MHPK
   scores (P-values< 0.05), which were sustained at the four-month
   follow-up (P-values>0.01). SWB improved in the post-test evaluation
   (P-value= 0.058). Conclusion The educational program effectively
   improved medical undergraduates' MHL and SWB. Given the rising concerns
   about medical students' mental health, implementing such curricula
   appears promising for long-term benefits.},

Title = {The effect of educational intervention based on social media on mental
   health literacy of high school students in Ramhormoz city: study
   protocol of a randomized controlled trial},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Month = {DEC 20},
Abstract = {Background: Adolescence is a critical period for developing and
   maintaining good habits for mental health and well-being. This is
   crucial for future mental health; as most mental health problems emerge
   during adolescence. Mental health literacy forms the foundation for
   preventing mental health issues, reducing stigma, and enhancing the
   effectiveness of help-seeking, particularly among adolescents.
   Objective: This study aims to measure the effect of social media-based
   educational intervention on mental health literacy among male high
   school students in Ramhormoz city.
   Methods: This randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluated the
   effectiveness of a social media-based intervention, designed around the
   core components of The Guide training package. The study involves all
   high schools in Ramhormoz city using a stratified random sampling
   method. A total of 204 students are expected to participate. Measures of
   mental health literacy and attitudes towards seeking professional
   psychological help are evaluated at three time points: before the
   intervention (baseline), 3months, and 6months after the intervention.
   Results: We anticipate a significant improvement in the mental health
   literacy score of the intervention group compared to the control group
   at post-intervention and both follow-ups. Additionally, we expect a
   substantial enhancement in the attitude towards seeking professional
   psychological help score for the intervention group compared to the
   control group at post-intervention and 6-month follow-up, though not at
   the 3-month follow-up.
   Conclusion: In conclusion, this study will contribute valuable insights
   into the effectiveness of social media-based interventions in enhancing
   mental health literacy and attitudes towards seeking professional help
   among high school students. The results will guide future initiatives in
   mental health education and promotion.
   Clinical trials: This study protocol is registered with the Iranian
   Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT) under the registration number
   IRCT20230603058372N1, dated June 5, 2023. The study adheres to the
   Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials
   (SPIRIT) guidelines, as outlined in Supplementary File S1.},

Abstract = {The present study aimed at identifying the prerequisites, facilitators,
   and barriers to adolescent mental health literacy interventions. To that
   end, databases PsycINFO, Science Direct, Scopus, Emerald, PubMed, Web of
   Science, and Google Scholar were systematically searched, out of which
   39 articles that had the inclusion criteria were analyzed by the content
   analysis. Databases searched from September 30, 2018, to October 10,
   2018, with the keywords ``health literacy,{''} ``mental health
   literacy,{''} ``mental disorders,{''} adolescents, students, and more.
   Seven themes were identified as the prerequisites for interventions to
   improve adolescents' mental health literacy including education at the
   school level, parents' education, training of trainers and providers,
   cooperation and participation among providers, intervention assessment
   and monitoring, provision of educational content, consideration of the
   cultural and linguistic issues. Five themes were identified as
   facilitators: using interactive learning and teaching methods, supplying
   diverse and stimulating educational content, employing trainers with
   different backgrounds, having direct contact with people with mental
   illness, and utilizing technological advancements in education. Finally,
   short-time intervention, the collaboration between school administrators
   and researchers, lack of valid information sources were identified as
   barriers.},

Title = {A qualitative evaluation of a mental health literacy intervention for
   parents delivered through community sport clubs},
Journal = {PSYCHOLOGY OF SPORT AND EXERCISE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {47},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Intervention studies have rarely targeted parent mental health literacy
   despite its importance for adolescent mental health. This qualitative
   study evaluated the experiences of parents (n = 352) who participated in
   the Ahead of the Game mental health literacy workshop delivered through
   community sport clubs. Moreover, the study aimed to investigate the
   relevance, retention and use of intervention content by parents, assess
   the acceptability and feasibility of delivering mental health education
   through community sport clubs, and identify strategies for increased
   engagement. In total, 17 parents (13 mothers, four fathers) participated
   in semi-structured interviews up to one month after the workshop.
   Reflexive thematic analysis revealed that parents perceived mental
   health education as important and valuable, and believed the community
   sport club was an appropriate setting to discuss adolescent mental
   health. Parents reported increased awareness and knowledge of mental
   health disorders and help-seeking options, and increased confidence and
   preparedness to communicate and assist someone experiencing a mental
   health issue. The workshop stimulated conversation about mental health
   between parents and their children, and between parents within and
   outside the sport club community. Parents used information and resources
   provided in the workshop to help those in their networks and reflected
   back on the workshop when noticing changes in their adolescent's
   behavior. Potential additions to the workshop (as suggested by parents)
   included increased discussion among parents as well as opportunities for
   further information sessions or tailored online material. Future
   research might look to engage more fathers, actively encourage parents
   to aid in the recruitment of others, and investigate long-term
   adolescent mental health outcomes.},

Title = {Effectiveness and Implementation Outcome Measures of Mental Health
   Curriculum Intervention Using Social Media to Improve the Mental Health
   Literacy of Adolescents},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY HEALTHCARE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Pages = {979-997},
Abstract = {Purpose: Globally, adolescent mental health problems reportedly manifest
   more severely in individuals with lower mental health literacy. Mental
   health curriculum interventions using social media have been associated
   with positive implementation outcomes. This study aimed to investigate
   whether such an intervention significantly improves adolescent mental
   health literacy and is associated with positive implementation outcome
   measures.
   Methods: This study employed a quasi-experimental design, comparing the
   before-and-after difference between the intervention group (n(1)=77) and
   the control group (n(1)=76). A mental health literacy module was
   delivered using social media. Data were collected using validated
   questionnaires. Effect size and difference-in-differences model
   calculations (and associated 95\% confidence intervals, CI) were
   conducted alongside other descriptive analyses.
   Results: The estimated intervention effect size and
   difference-in-differences estimates were greater than zero. The effect
   was greater in the intervention than in the control group (p<0.05)
   despite sex and age differences. The effect size estimate provided by
   Cohen's d and Hedges' g values was medium-to-large (d/g=0.429-0.767,
   p<0.05). The difference-in-differences reflected a significant effect
   (DID=0.348, CI: 0.154-0.542, p<0.001) in increasing mental health
   literacy despite differences associated with sex, age, and school grade.
   The intervention program was acceptable, appropriate, feasible, and
   satisfactory, and more than 80\% of participants said they agree to
   completely agree with these implementation outcomes. Resources and
   personal and family-related factors were among the perceived influencing
   factors determining the effectiveness and implementation outcome
   measures.
   Conclusion: The intervention program effectively improved the mental
   health literacy of adolescents. It has been highlighted that social
   media interventions for mental health promotion could be practical and
   scalable; however, there is a need to take into account
   socio-demographic differences and barriers to inclusion/compliance.},

Abstract = {Mental disorders make up close to one-third of the global burden of
   disease experienced during adolescence. Schools can play an important
   role in the promotion of positive mental health as well as an integral
   role in the pathways into mental health care for adolescents. In order
   for schools to effectively address the mental health problems of their
   students, educators must improve their mental health literacy. The
   current study examines the impact of an educator training programme
   designed to support educators in the delivery of a high school mental
   health curriculum within their classrooms, such as health class.
   Specifically, a paired-samples t test was used to examine the change in
   educators' knowledge and attitudes regarding mental health following
   their participation in this educator training. Eighty-three educators
   participated in the training, and survey data from 79 were included in
   the final analysis. Structured feedback on the training was obtained.
   Significant increases in both knowledge and attitudes scores were
   demonstrated. The training sessions were highly rated. Findings from
   this report demonstrate the potential value of mental health literacy
   training to improve the mental health knowledge and attitudes of
   educators. Improved educator knowledge and attitudes may be necessary in
   order for schools to provide effective mental health promotion and
   prevention programming.},

Title = {The effect of intervention based on adapted mental health literacy

   students in Iran},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EDUCATION AND HEALTH PROMOTION},

Abstract = {Background:Adolescent mental health is a major public health concern in
   Iran, with 1 of every 5 adolescents suffering from a mental disorder.
   Mental health literacy (MHL) is an important factor in improving mental
   health outcomes. To address this issue, a mental health literacy school
   curriculum used in Canada was adapted, piloted, and evaluated for use in
   Iranian schools. This study examines the impact of the intervention on
   the attitude and help-seeking intentions of first and secondary students
   in Iran. Materials and Methods:This study is semiexperimental research
   that was conducted on 200 female teenagers who were studying in girls'
   secondary schools in Saveh, Central part of Iran, in 2023. The
   participants were divided into two groups, namely, the intervention
   group and the control group. Both groups completed a valid and reliable
   questionnaire that assessed their attitude and help-seeking intention at
   two different time points. To evaluate the intervention's effects, a
   repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used. Results:The
   study used the repeated-measures ANOVA to assess the changes in the mean
   attitude and help-seeking intention scores between the intervention and
   control groups. The findings indicated significant improvements in the
   attitude of help-seeking (P < 0.001), informal help-seeking intention (P
   < 0.001), and formal help-seeking intention (P < 0.001) for the
   intervention group as compared to the control group during the study.
   Conclusion:The adapted mental health literacy school curriculum has been
   used and evaluated for the first time in Iran, and it has shown a
   significant increase in attitude and help-seeking intention among first
   and secondary female students. These results need to be confirmed by
   further studies, which should also analyze the interrelationships
   between different dimensions of mental health knowledge and help-seeking
   practices. Keywords for this study include mental health literacy,
   help-seeking, attitude, and female students.},

Abstract = {Youth workers provide services to youth and their families in different
   fields such as recreation, social justice, mental health.They play an
   important role in the well-being of youth and thus, mental health
   literacy (MHL) should be an integral part of professional preparation.
   The present grounded theory study examined how a MHL curriculum,
   specifically designed for youth work, is applied in interventions with
   young people suffering from suicidality or mental health concerns.
   Thirteen participants involved in higher education programmes and
   engaged in youth work practice participated in the study. Over 60
   sources of data (i.e. interviews, written reflections, creative
   artefacts, observations) were used in the analysis. Findings suggest
   that the process of becoming and being in youth work is comprised of two
   sub-categories: struggling to become and being a youth worker.
   Conditions such as learning activities and specific content in the
   curriculum shaped and influenced the process and, consequentially,
   participants' movement therein. These findings imply that promoting MHL
   and professional identity development are intertwined learning processes
   such that mental health education must integrate issues of professional
   identity.},

   (K-MIR) scale. This scale was validated using item-response theory,
   demonstrating good psychometric properties. Youth answered two coping
   questions about their use of positive coping during the program and
   coping skills compared from pre to post intervention. Findings revealed
   that youth levels of mental health literacy increased significantly from
   pre to post program participation. Over 90\% of the youth reported an
   improved use of positive coping strategies from pre to post
   intervention. The program appeared to deliver enhanced levels of
   literacy and coping for this sample of youth. The scale appeared to be
   appropriate to measure youth mental health literacy. Recommendations for
   practice, policy, and research are offered.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to provide a group music therapy
   intervention for elementary and middle school students with mood
   disorders through music therapy. To explore the improvement of group
   music therapy on the dysphoria and state of adolescent patients with
   mood disorders and to explore the relationship with self-identity. A
   music activity-based mental health education curriculum was designed
   based on the results of the current survey, while two homogenous classes
   were selected as the experimental and control classes; subsequently, the
   experimental teaching of the music activity-based mental health
   education curriculum was conducted in the experimental class, and the
   regular school mental health education curriculum was conducted in the
   control class, and the pre- and postexperimental scale tests were used
   to analyze that the curriculum of this study had a positive effect of
   this study's curriculum on elementary school students' positive emotions
   analyzed through pre- and postexperimental scale tests. The music
   activity-based mental health education program had a significant
   positive effect on the overall level of positive emotions of elementary
   school students, especially in the positive emotion index, happiness
   index, mental toughness, goal focus, and interpersonal assistance
   factor. The positive psychology-oriented music activity-based mental
   health education curriculum is well suited for elementary and middle
   school students, especially for upper elementary and middle school
   students. The music activity-based mental health education curriculum
   realizes the value of applying positive psychology to mental health
   education efforts at the elementary school level and flexibly uses a
   variety of related theories to promote positive emotional experiences
   for elementary and middle school students.},

   India- A cluster randomized controlled trial protocol},
Journal = {MENTAL HEALTH \& PREVENTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {36},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: Mental health conditions are a significant burden during
   adolescence, with up to 50 \% starting before age 14. Suicide is among
   the top three causes of death in this age group, highlighting the need
   for effective mental health interventions. Objective: The primary
   objective of the study is to determine the effectiveness of school-based
   Scaling up Teen Mental Health Program through peer synergy (SUTMP) on
   mental health literacy among senior secondary students. Methods: A
   cluster randomized controlled trial will be conducted among the students
   of government senior secondary schools. The intervention comprises five
   modules focusing on mental health literacy, mental health promotion,
   peer synergy on first aid in mental health, strengthening resilience,
   and the fifth module focuses on relaxation exercises, meditation and
   deep breathing techniques, and mindfulness with `Teen mental health
   app.' Students will be assessed using the Resilience Scale, Mental
   Health Promotion Knowledge Scale, Peer Mental Health Stigmatization
   Scale, Teen Mental Health Literacy Scale, and Peer Synergy on Mental
   Health First Aid Scale. Assessment will be done before the intervention,
   one week after, at three and six months post-intervention. Expected
   results: The anticipated outcome of the study is that the school-based
   Scaling up Teen Mental Health Program (SUTMP) will increase mental
   health literacy among school students, strengthen their resilience
   skills, and increase the use of a peer-led approach for providing
   initial mental health first aid. Conclusion: The study will employ an
   innovative module for delivering the intervention, integrating on-site
   and app-based approaches in a blended manner.},

Abstract = {Objectives: A number of school-based interventions for preventing and
   attenuating symptoms of anxiety and depression in youth have been
   developed worldwide but evidence of their effectiveness is mixed. None
   of these curricula stem from existing children's literature, however,
   the Harry Potter (HP) series has been identified as potentially
   imparting Cognitive Behavioural Therapy concepts. Methods: This study
   aimed to broadly capture, at an interim stage, the feasibility of a
   pilot HP curriculum aimed at imparting CBT skills to middle-schoolers in
   order to inform full development of the curriculum. The study design
   further included a non-randomized, Group (HP; Control) by Time
   (Baseline, Post-Intervention, Followup) mixed factorial approach
   retrospectively examining change in scores on a ``Well-Being and
   Resiliency Survey{''} (WBRS) which assessed multiple symptomatic and
   social domains. Results: In total, 232 grade seven and eight students
   participated in the curriculum over two years with no dropouts. Compared
   to 362 controls, there were no significant differences in WBRS scores
   between groups at post or one-year follow-up. Conclusions: This pilot
   study demonstrated the feasibility of rapid and broad implementation of
   the intervention. Preliminary analyses showed no indication of
   effectiveness which may be the product of the intervention being in an
   interim stage during the study period and/or the retrospective design
   and limitations in data quality. Specifically, these results suggest
   that the WBRS may be a suboptimal instrument for measuring the
   effectiveness of this intervention. A prospective trial of the complete,
   revised curriculum with validated measures is required to provide an
   adequately assessment of its impact.},

Title = {Effectiveness of mental health literacy intervention and contact-based
   education on knowledge, attitude, and stigma towards mental health among
   secondary school students in Chennai, South India: A cluster randomized
   controlled trial},
Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {102},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: Global trends indicate a rise in mental health disorders
   among youth, prompting need for effective interventions. Mental health
   literacy interventions have demonstrated benefits such as improved
   knowledge, treatment understanding, help-seeking behaviors, and stigma
   reduction. This study aimed to assess the impact of a comprehensive
   mental health literacy program on knowledge, attitudes, and stigma
   related to mental health among secondary school students in Chennai.
   Methods: Cluster-randomized controlled trial was conducted among
   students from four secondary schools. Randomization was at cluster level
   to minimize contamination. Participating schools provided consent, and
   all ninth-grade students were invited to participate. Written informed
   consent was obtained from parents/guardians, and assent was obtained
   from students. There were no specific exclusion criteria, except for
   students who declined to participate. Analyses were performed using
   intention-to-treat principles, with multiple imputation for missing
   outcome data. Results: After adjusting for cluster effects, the
   intervention group showed a significant improvement in attitude scores
   compared to the control group (mean difference 0.85, 95 \% CI:
   0.32-1.39, p = 0.002). However, no significant differences were observed
   between the two groups in terms of knowledge and stigma. Conclusion: The
   findings suggest that delivering a mental health literacy curriculum
   alongside contact-based education involving individuals with lived
   experiences of mental disorders positively influences students'
   attitudes toward mental health. Although no significant changes were
   observed in knowledge and stigma levels, the integration of mental
   health literacy programs with personal narratives from those with lived
   experiences holds promise for addressing mental health stigma and
   promoting positive attitudes among school students.},

Title = {Teaching mental health in the classroom: A mixed-methods implementation
   evaluation of a mental health literacy program in elementary schools},
Journal = {MENTAL HEALTH \& PREVENTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {36},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Objective: Mental illnesses are the largest disease burden for
   adolescents, affecting 20 \% of youth in Canada. As mental health needs
   arise earlier and with greater prevalence, it is essential to work
   upstream and prepare youth before psychological distress emerges. When
   implemented in the classroom as part of the educational curriculum,
   Mental Health Literacy (MHL) fulfills these goals as a universal
   response to the societal and development stressors experienced by youth.
   The aim of this implementation evaluation was to explore the experience
   of educators delivering the Elementary Mental Health Literacy Resources
   (EMHLR) during a 4-month period across Canada. The specific objectives
   were to identify the individual (educator) and organizational (district)
   level barriers and facilitators to delivery of the EMHLR to improve
   future implementation of the program. Methods: An explanatory sequential
   design used data from an existing feedback survey and qualitative data
   was gathered from group interviews with Educators. Findings were
   integrated using the RE-AIM framework to identify barriers and
   facilitators and develop considerations for implementation Results:
   System level barriers included the pre-existing stigma around mental
   health, competing priorities for classroom time, and cultivating buy-in
   from leadership. Individual level barriers included the time and
   knowledge to teach MHL. The flexible design of the EMHLR curriculum and
   specific implementation strategies were seen as facilitators. Mental
   Health Literacy offers language for youth to communicate about their
   experience clearly and accurately. Conclusion: The EMHLR curriculum
   offers an evidence-based and adaptable means to build the MHL of youth
   across Canada. This holds potential for improving youth mental health
   but requires intentional implementation strategies to be successful.},

Abstract = {The prevalence of mental disorders in adolescents has a considerable
   impact on daily life, restricting tasks and diminishing overall quality
   of life while potentially leading to stigmatization. This study aims to
   measure the impact of a mental health literacy intervention program,
   called ``Bicho de 7 Cabecas{''} project, in b-learning format, on the
   increase of knowledge and the decrease of stigma in young people from
   Povoa de Varzim, in Portugal. A quasi-experimental study was conducted,
   from November 2022 to May 2023, involving an experimental group
   ({''}Bicho de 7 Cabecas{''} protocol) and an active control group
   (informational brochures), utilizing a pre-test/post-test design. Mental
   Health Literacy Measure-MHLM, Mental Health Promoting Knowledge
   Scale-MHPK-10, Mental Illness Knowledge Schedule-MAKS, Reported and
   Intended Behaviour Scale-RIBS, and Community Attitudes toward People
   with Mental Illness-CAMI were used. A total of 504 young students from
   the 9th grade enroll in this study, with a mean age around 14 years old.
   There is a significant difference between stigma (p <.001) and knowledge
   (p <.001) scores at baseline and follow-up. The results of this study
   shows that interventions aimed at young people for the promotion of
   mental health literacy and stigma reduction are needed and more
   initiatives should be implemented in schools to address these problems.},

Title = {A school intervention for mental health literacy in adolescents: effects
   of a non-randomized cluster controlled trial},
Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {13},
Month = {SEP 23},
Abstract = {Background: ``Mental health for everyone{''} is a school program for
   mental health literacy and prevention aimed at secondary schools (13-15
   yrs). The main aim was to investigate whether mental health literacy,
   could be improved by a 3-days universal education programme by: a)
   improving naming of symptom profiles of mental disorder, b) reducing
   prejudiced beliefs, and c) improving knowledge about where to seek help
   for mental health problems. A secondary aim was to investigate whether
   adolescent sex and age influenced the above mentioned variables. A third
   aim was to investigate whether prejudiced beliefs influenced knowledge
   about available help.
   Method: This non-randomized cluster controlled trial included 1070
   adolescents (53.9\% boys, M age14 yrs) from three schools in a Norwegian
   town. One school (n = 520) received the intervention, and two schools (n
   = 550) formed the control group. Pre-test and follow-up were three
   months apart. Linear mixed models and generalized estimating equations
   models were employed for analysis.
   Results: Mental health literacy improved contingent on the intervention,
   and there was a shift towards suggesting primary health care as a place
   to seek help. Those with more prejudiced beleifs did not suggest places
   to seek help for mental health problems. Generally, girls and older
   adolescents recognized symptom profiles better and had lower levels of
   prejudiced beliefs.
   Conclusions: A low cost general school program may improve mental health
   literacy in adolescents. Gender specific programs and attention to the
   age and maturity of the students should be considered when mental health
   literacy programmes are designed and tried out. Prejudice should be
   addressed before imparting information about mental health issues.},

Title = {A survey on the relationship between mental health literacy and beliefs

Journal = {ARCHIVES OF PSYCHIATRIC NURSING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {53},
Pages = {144-150},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Aim: The study aimed to determine the relationship between general
   nurses' mental health literacy and beliefs toward mental illness.
   Method: The study involved 285 nurses aged 23 to 47 from three hospitals
   in western Turkey, who completed the Mental Health Literacy Scale (MHLS)
   and the Beliefs Toward Mental Illness Scale (BMIS) between December 2023
   and March 2024. Results: Those who received training on mental illnesses
   as students (t = 2.115, p = 0.018), those who had moderate knowledge
   about mental illnesses (F = 8.177, p < 0.001), those who were willing to
   receive training on mental illnesses (t = 1.673, p = 0.048), those who
   encounter individuals with mental illness in their work units (F =
   11.233, p < 0.001) and those who care for individuals with mental
   illness in their work units (t = 1.808, p = 0.036) have higher mental
   health literacy levels. There was a negative relationship between
   nurses' negative beliefs toward mental illness levels and their mental
   health literacymental health literacy levels (r = -0.432, p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Mental health literacy is a crucial element in reducing
   general nurses' negative beliefs about mental illnesses. Th \& imath;us,
   psychiatric mental health nurses can actively prevent negative beliefs
   and increase awareness by providing mental health education to general
   nurses. Awareness programs should be accorded greater emphasize on
   individuals who are not trained in mental disorders when they are
   students, those who have low knowledge about mental disorders, those who
   are reluctant to receive training on mental disorders, and cohorts of
   nurses who are likely to encounter patients with mental disorders in
   their respective work units.},

Title = {Is It Possible to ``Find Space for Mental Health{''} in Young People?
   Effectiveness of a School-Based Mental Health Literacy Promotion Program},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {15},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Lack of knowledge regarding, and the stigma associated with, mental
   disorders have been identified as major obstacles for the promotion of
   mental health and early intervention. The present study aimed to
   evaluate the effectiveness of a school-based intervention program
   focused on the promotion of mental health literacy (MHL) in young people
   ({''}Finding Space for Mental Health{''}). A sample of 543 students (22
   classes), aged between 12 and 14 years old, participated in the study.
   Each class of students was randomly assigned to the control group (CG; n
   = 284; 11 classes) or the experimental group (EG; n = 259; 11 classes).
   MHL was assessed using the Mental Health Literacy questionnaire (MHLq),
   which is comprised of three dimensions-Knowledge/Stereotypes, First Aid
   Skills and Help Seeking, and Self-Help Strategies. The scores on these
   dimensions can also be combined to give an overall or total score.
   Participants from the EG attended the MHL promotion program (two
   sessions, 90 min each) delivered at one-week intervals. Sessions
   followed an interactive methodology, using group dynamics, music, and
   videos adapted to the target group. All participants responded to the
   MHLq at three points in time: pre-intervention assessment (one week
   prior to the intervention), post-intervention assessment (one week after
   the intervention) and follow-up assessment (six months after the
   intervention). The intervention effectiveness and the differential
   impact of sociodemographic variables on the effectiveness of the program
   were studied using a Generalized Estimation Equation (GEE). Results
   revealed that participants from the EG demonstrated, on average,
   significantly higher improvement in MHL from pre-intervention to
   follow-up when compared to participants from the CG. Different
   sociodemographic variables affected the effectiveness of the program on
   distinct dimensions of the MHLq. Overall, ``Finding Space for Mental
   Health{''} showed efficacy as a short-term promotion program for
   improving MHL in schools.},

Abstract = {This controlled trial evaluated the effectiveness of a mental health
   literacy intervention for parents delivered through community sport
   clubs. In total, 540 parents (321 females, 219 males) of adolescent
   athletes participated in a brief educational workshop on youth mental
   health (n = 352) or a community-matched control group (n = 188).
   Generalised linear mixed models revealed no significant improvements in
   the intervention group compared to control in the primary mental health
   literacy outcomes, at 1 month follow-up. However, parents in the
   intervention group were more likely to seek formal help for themselves,
   had increased confidence and knowledge to help someone experiencing a
   mental health disorder, experienced reduced psychological distress, and
   perceived more support from other parents in their sport club, relative
   to the control group. Overall, the findings suggest that a brief
   educational intervention delivered through community sports clubs can
   positively affect some components of parents' mental health literacy.},

Abstract = {Introduction: School-based education is a potentially effective approach
   for improving mental health literacy (MHL) in adolescents. This study
   evaluated the effects of the ``Short MHL Program (SMHLP){''}, a brief
   (50 min), school teacher-led program, on MHL in adolescents in a
   quasi-cluster randomized controlled trial.
   Methods: A total of 975 high school first graders (age 15-16) in Japan
   were allocated to classes such that gender and academic achievement
   ratios were almost equivalent at the time of admission to the high
   school. They were assigned at the class level to the SMHLP (n = 364 from
   10 classes) or a control group (n = 611 from 17 classes). The program
   consisted of a 50-minute session and was delivered by a school teacher.
   The students completed a self-report questionnaire at 3 time points:
   pre-, (immediately) post- and 2-month follow-up. Outcomes included
   ``Knowledge about mental health/illnesses{''}, ``Recognition of the
   necessity to seek help{''}, ``Intention to seek help{''}, and
   ``Intention of helping peers{''}. Mixed effects modeling was employed
   for analyses.
   Results: Scores of all outcomes were significantly improved in the
   intervention group compared to the control group post-intervention (p <
   .001). These improvements were maintained at 2-months follow-up for all
   outcomes (p < .001-.05). Questionnaire scores did not differ between
   groups at baseline.
   Conclusions: The effect of the SMHLP was confirmed in grade 10 students.
   Brief, yet effective programs can be a viable option to promote
   understanding of mental health problems and have the potential to be
   incorporated into regular school curriculum.{''}},

Abstract = {The purpose of this school-based cluster-randomized trial was to
   determine the initial acceptability, feasibility, and efficacy of an
   existing community-based intervention, In Our Own Voice, in a sample of
   US adolescent girls aged 13-17 years (n = 156). In Our Own Voice is a
   knowledge-contact intervention that provides knowledge about mental
   illness to improve mental health literacy and facilitates intergroup
   contact with persons with mental illness as a means to reduce mental
   illness stigma. This longitudinal study was set in two public high
   schools located in a southern urban community of the U.S. Outcomes
   included measures of mental illness stigma and mental health literacy.
   Findings support the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention
   for adolescents who enrolled in the study. Findings to support the
   efficacy of In Our own Voice to reduce stigma and improve mental health
   literacy are mixed. The intervention did not reduce mental illness
   stigma or improve mental health literacy at one week follow up. The
   intervention did not reduce mental illness stigma at 4 and 8 weeks
   follow up. The intervention did improve mental health literacy at 4 and
   8 weeks follow up. Previous studies have assessed the preliminary
   efficacy In Our Own Voice among young adults; rarely has In Our Own
   Voice been investigated longitudinally and with adolescents in the
   United States. This study provides initial data on the effects of In Our
   Own Voice for this population and can be used to further adapt the
   intervention for adolescents. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Aims There has been a surge in child mental health literacy training
   programmes for non-mental health professionals. No previous review has
   examined the effectiveness of child mental literacy training on all
   professionals in contact with children.
   Methods Studies were identified through a systematic literature search
   of the Cochrane, EMBASE, Medline, and PsycINFO databases in February
   2019. The review included studies that delivered training to
   professionals who have regular contact with young people aged 0 to 19 in
   the context of their role and at least one component of mental health
   literacy; (a) knowledge, (b) attitudes, (c) confidence in helping, (d)
   intention to help and (e) actual helping behaviour. The quality of
   papers was reviewed using the Cochrane revised Risk of Bias Tool for
   randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and the Integrated Quality Criteria
   for the Review of Multiple Study Designs for non RCTs.
   Results Twenty-one studies met eligibility criteria (n = 3243). There
   was some evidence that global and specific child mental health literacy
   training improved professionals' knowledge and stigma-related attitudes
   towards mental health. Few studies investigated the impact of training
   on actual helping behaviour.
   Conclusion There may be value in providing child mental health literacy
   training to professionals in contact with children, however there is a
   need for studies to evaluate the long-term impact of such training,
   particularly on subsequent access to appropriate support. Findings raise
   concerns about the quality of the studies reported in the systematic
   review and recommendations are made for future studies.},

Title = {Enhancing warning signs of mental health literacy: Evaluating a digital

Journal = {ARCHIVES OF PSYCHIATRIC NURSING},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {54},
Pages = {91-101},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Background: Despite its importance, Mental health literacy (MHL) among
   nursing and other health profession students often remains inadequate,
   potentially impacting their future roles as healthcare providers. This
   inadequacy can lead to delayed or inappropriate care for individuals
   with mental health concerns, perpetuating adverse outcomes and
   increasing the burden on healthcare systems. Aim: To evaluate a
   digital-based intervention designed to enhance the warning signs of
   mental health literacy among health profession students. Design: A
   quasi-experimental, one-group pretest-posttest study design was used to
   conduct the current study. Methods: A non-randomized trial was conducted
   using digital mental health literacy intervention about the warning
   signs of mental illness (DWS), involving a convenience sample of 493
   undergraduate health profession students. Mental Health Literacy Survey
   About Warning Signs of Mental Illness was developed and validated to
   measure the participants' mental health literacy before and after the
   intervention. Results: Almost all Warning Signs of Mental Illness
   Literacy items were significantly increased from pre- to post-
   intervention. Both sub-sums representing the knowledge subscale (items 1
   to 11) and attitude subscale (items 12 to 15) significantly increased to
   4.4 (CI 3.7, 5.0) and 0.7 (CI 0.5, 0.9), respectively. Differences were
   more extensive and significant on the knowledge subscale items 0.4 (CI
   0.3, 0.5) than on the attitude subscale mean items 0.2 (CI 0.1, 0.2).
   Conclusion: The DWS is an effective and easy-to-use education program
   for health profession students. The current study is an initial step
   toward building a body of knowledge about mental health literacy in the
   region.},

   Systematic literature review by searching the ScienceDirect, Scopus,
   PubMed, Crochrane and CINAHL databases. Seven of 1107 papers were
   included in the final review. Results Supporting interventions for
   improving MHL in adolescents could be categorised into school-based and
   community-based. Both types used an education stand-alone strategy or an
   education plus contact-based group in their programmes. To provide
   knowledge of mental illness to adolescents, teaching methods should be
   interactive and use various media such as group discussion, videos and
   movies. Conclusions School-based and community-based interventions were
   likely to improve MHL among adolescents. However, further research with
   objective tool measures is needed to confirm the findings.},

Title = {Qualitative evaluation of a sports-based mental health literacy program
   for adolescent males},
Journal = {PSYCHOLOGY OF SPORT AND EXERCISE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {56},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Objective: This study aimed to understand adolescent males' experience
   of participating in a sports-based mental health literacy intervention
   (Help Out a Mate), and provide insight into their perceptions of the
   effectiveness and implementation of the program.
   Method: Thirty-three adolescent males (12-15 years old) who had recently
   participated in Help Out a Mate took part in six focus groups. Inductive
   thematic analysis was used to analyse focus group data, and a number of
   strategies were employed to enhance the trustworthiness of this account,
   including peer debrief, grounding in examples, and prolonged engagement.
   Results: These data indicated that these adolescent males broadly had a
   positive experience of Help Out a Mate and reported that the program was
   effective in terms of mental health literacy outcomes including
   increased knowledge of mental health, and increased confidence and
   intentions to seek and provide help. Delivering the program in the
   context of sport was reported as engaging, and preferable to delivery in
   a school context. Whilst some adolescents reported reductions in
   stigmatising attitudes following the program, others expressed a
   maintenance of these attitudes, suggesting addressing stigma remains a
   challenge for mental health literacy workshops. Further, adolescents
   reported that the program could be improved by including more practical
   activities and better group management by facilitators.
   Conclusions: These findings identify important insights into adolescent
   males' perspectives of the effectiveness and importance of Help Out A
   Mate as a sports-based mental health literacy intervention, and suggest
   a number of strategies for improving participation and engagement.},

Abstract = {RationaleMental health literacy enables adolescents to acquire
   information that will accompany them in their future lives and to define
   their attitudes and behaviors.Aims and ObjectivesThis study evaluated
   the Turkish validity and reliability of the Universal Mental Health
   Literacy Scale for Adolescents (10-14 years).MethodsThis is a
   methodological, correlational, cross-sectional, and descriptive study.
   The study was conducted with 223 adolescents. Data were collected by
   `Information Form' and `Universal Mental Health Literacy Scale for
   Adolescents.' Exploratory Factor Analysis, Confirmatory Factor Analysis,
   and Pearson Correlation analysis were used to assess the validity and
   reliability of the UMHL-A.ResultsItem Content Validity Index (I-CVI)
   scores ranged from 0.94 to 0.96, while the Scale Content Validity Index
   (S-CVI) was 0.95. For `Help-seeking and Stigma dimensions' chi 2/df =
   3.347, NFI = 0.804, IFI = 0.854, TLI = 0.778, CFI = 0.849, RMSEA =
   0.103. For `Knowledge of Mental Health and Knowledge of Mental Illnesses
   dimensions' chi 2/df = 1.959, NFI = 0.731, IFI = 0.847, TLI = 0.774, CFI
   = 0.837, RMSEA = 0.066. The internal consistency and time stability were
   affirmed by a Hotelling T-square value of 15.241 and an F-test result of
   27.793.ConclusionsThis study reveals that the Turkish validity and
   reliability of the Universal Mental Health Literacy Scale for
   Adolescents is a valid and reliable tool for assessing mental health
   literacy among adolescents. The UMHL-A scale is a valid tool to evaluate
   critical aspects of mental health literacy in adolescent populations and
   can be used in both research and clinical practice in mental health
   education and intervention. It is recommended that the Turkish version
   of the Universal Mental Health Literacy Scale should be used to
   determine resilience in adolescents.},

Abstract = {Purpose
   In this study, we tested the effectiveness of a multicomponent
   sports-based program aimed at promoting early intervention, help
   seeking, and resilience among a sample of adolescent male sport
   participants. Methods
   The Ahead of the Game program comprised four intervention components and
   a messaging campaign. Two components targeted mental health literacy,
   intentions to seek and provide help, and resilience among adolescent
   boys. A mental health literacy program for parents and a coach education
   program to assist in the support of athletes' psychological needs were
   also included. We evaluated the program using a nonrandomized controlled
   trial matching two regional communities. In total, 350 sport
   participants (mean, 14.53 yr) were included in an intervention group,
   whereas 466 (mean, 14.66 yr) received usual practice in a matched
   control community. One hundred and eighty parents or caregivers and
   eight coaches also participated in the intervention components.
   Between-group mean differences on the primary and secondary outcomes
   were analyzed using linear mixed models, adjusted for clustering at club
   level, participant age, and socioeconomic status. Results
   Significant positive group-time interactions were found for the primary
   outcomes of depression and anxiety literacy, intentions to seek help
   from formal sources, confidence to seek mental health information, and
   resilience. We also found a significant positive group-time interaction
   for the secondary outcome of well-being. There were no group-time
   interactions for social distance (stigma), intentions to seek help from
   informal sources, implicit beliefs about adversity, perceived familial
   support, or psychological distress. Conclusions
   Given the high rates of sport participation worldwide and the increasing
   focus on mental health in this domain, translation and dissemination of
   the program may be warranted after replication.},

Abstract = {Suicide and self-harm are a leading cause of death globally, with
   females aged 15-24 years being a high-risk group requiring urgent
   intervention. Promoting mental health literacy is a well-established
   strategy for early intervention. No review has explored the available
   interventions promoting mental health literacy for female adolescents
   and their reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and
   maintenance as a whole remains unknown. This study reviews existing
   interventions promoting mental health literacy in female adolescents.
   Searches included original peer-reviewed articles from inception to May
   2024 across six databases, identifying twelve studies for review. Five
   independent meta-analyses were conducted, showing no significant effects
   immediately post-intervention for mental health literacy, knowledge,
   stigmatising attitudes, and help-provision. A significant reduction in
   stigmatising attitudes was found > 6 months post-intervention.
   Moderation analyses could not be performed due to insufficient data.
   None of the included studies reported on interventions specifically for
   female adolescents. This review also evaluated reporting of RE-AIM
   components, finding limited reporting on reach, adoption, and
   maintenance. These findings highlight a substantial gap in high-impact
   and tailored mental health prevention and promotion interventions for
   female adolescents. Therefore, there is a clear need to understand and
   target female adolescents' mental health literacy needs to develop and
   implement more effective interventions.},

Abstract = {Evidence suggests that poor mental health literacy is a key barrier to
   help-seeking for mental health difficulties in adolescence. Educational
   programs have shown positive effects on literacy, however, the evidence
   base remains limited and available studies have many methodological
   limitations. Using cluster Randomised Control Trial (RCT) methodology,
   the current study examines the impact of `HeadStrong', a school-based
   educational intervention, on mental health literacy, stigma,
   help-seeking, psychological distress and suicidal ideation. A total of
   380 students in 22 classes (clusters) from 10 non-government secondary
   schools was randomised to receive either HeadStrong or Personal
   Development, Health and Physical Education (PDHPE) classes. Participants
   were assessed pre- and post-intervention, and at 6-month follow-up.
   Literacy improved and stigma reduced in both groups at post-intervention
   and follow-up, relative to baseline. However, these effects were
   significantly greater in the HeadStrong condition. The study
   demonstrates the potential of HeadStrong to improve mental health
   literacy and reduce stigma. (C) 2014 The Foundation for Professionals in

Abstract = {Objective This paper presents a review of the current state of child and
   adolescent mental health literacy and provides current evidence of the
   economic impact of a pediatric mental health literacy (MHL) training
   program. Methods Employing a case-series-comparison design, physician
   referrals to urgent and specialized mental health services were linked
   with patient-specific information comparing referrals from MHL
   participants and non-participating physicians. The economic impact
   analysis was based on changes in the admitted referral frequency and
   lengths of stay for the MHL group, compared to themselves pretraining,
   and over the same time period compared to non-participating physicians.
   Results Average scheduled ambulatory admission rates per physician
   remained constant for trained and untrained pre-post groups. Average
   scheduled ambulatory admission wait time and length of stay reduced
   significantly post-training for MHL-trained physicians compared to
   pre-training and untrained physicians. In addition to reductions in
   length of stay, the total bed costs saving for emergency/ inpatients
   admission deferrals was \$2,932,112 or about \$20,000 per MHL-trained
   physician. Conclusion The estimated economic impact of the MHL training
   shows a substantial return on investment and supports wider
   implementation. The MHL training program should be a key feature of
   mental health reform strategies, as well as continuing and undergraduate
   medical education. Psychiatry Investig 2021;18(7):695-700},

Abstract = {Background The relevance of mental health literacy (MHL) for youth as a
   supporting factor for dealing with mental health problems and illness
   has been stressed. Therefore, strengthening MHL becomes a focus of
   preventive interventions. As there are hardly any MHL programs in
   Germany, a Canadian program was adapted, implemented and evaluated. The
   program's effectiveness has been documented internationally (e.g., in
   terms of increased knowledge and stigma reduction); however, there are
   no reports of how the program was perceived by the target group. The
   present study focuses on the students' perception of the program to
   examine whether the program is suitable for German students. Objective
   The students' perception of the program is presented in terms of its
   acceptability, appropriateness, and needs based adequacy. Material and
   methods The adapted German version of the program was piloted and
   evaluated in schools in Bielefeld, Germany. Participating students rated
   the program by answering program-specific questions. Results On average
   students of the nine participating classes positively rated the overall
   program, different program aspects and its relevance to students of the
   same age. Additionally, the evaluation of open-ended statements confirms
   that the program addresses students' needs and interests regarding the
   topic of mental health as well as its ability to reach students of the
   heterogeneous sample. Conclusion The results suggest that the adapted
   program is suitable for students in German schools. Further studies are
   needed to consolidate these findings. Moreover, program evaluations
   should consider the perception of the target group, as this provides
   insights into the acceptance and adaptation needs of the program.},

   Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH},

Abstract = {Objectives: This study aims to provide a systematic review and
   meta-analysis of the literature on the long-term effects of
   interventions addressing children's and adolescents' mental health
   literacy and/or stigmatizing attitudes.Methods: Articles in English or
   German published between January 1997 and May 2020 were retrieved from
   five databases, leading to a total of 4,375 original articles
   identified.Results: 25 studies were included after applying exclusion
   criteria, 13 of which were eligible for meta-analysis. The overall
   average of the follow-up period was about 5 months. Long-term
   improvements were sustained for mental health literacy, d = 0.48, 95\%
   CI = (0.34, 0.62), as well as for stigmatizing attitudes, d = 0.30, 95\%
   CI = (0.24, 0.36), and social distance, d = 0.16, 95\% CI = (0.03,
   0.29). The combination of educational and contact components within
   interventions led to worse results for mental health literacy, but not
   stigmatizing attitudes or social distance.Conclusion: Interventions
   targeting children and adolescents generally have a brief follow-up
   period of an average of 5 months. They show a stable improvement in
   mental health literacy, but are to a lesser degree able to destigmatize
   mental illness or improve social distance.},

Pages = {30-55},
Abstract = {This paper provides an overview of the development and field test
   evaluation of a group-based youth mental health promotion program known
   as the Core Connectors Initiative (CCI). CCI is a program that aims to
   help youth gain mental health knowledge and peer support competencies,
   and reinforce positive help-seeking behaviour. The purpose of the study
   was to evaluate and refine CCI by examining whether it attains its
   training objectives of mental health literacy, gatekeeper training, and
   fostering positive youth development, while exploring helpful and
   unhelpful participant experiences of the program. CCI was field tested
   during the latter half of the 2017/2018 school year at 3 different
   locations: a private school, a community centre, and a public school.
   Using mixed methods, the evaluation yielded information on the strengths
   and areas of growth for future program development. The quantitative
   data were collected from a sample of 29 youth, while the qualitative
   data were collected from 9 youth using the Enhanced Critical Incident
   Technique. The converging data highlight the importance of connection,
   the value of critical mental health literacy, and the importance of
   clarifying expectations. The lessons learned from implementing this
   program can be applied to other youth mental health promotion programs.},

Abstract = {Among other responsibilities, youth sport coaches are positioned to
   monitor and address the mental health needs of their athletes. Despite
   this, there are limited interventions aimed at improving coaches' mental
   health literacy. Using a mixed-methods design, the aim of this pilot
   study was to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and mental health
   literacy outcomes associated with a brief (75 min) workshop for youth
   sport coaches. Fourteen coaches (13 males, one female) completed pre-
   and postworkshop surveys measuring indices of mental health literacy,
   and 10 of these same participants engaged in a semistructured interview
   1-month later. Overall, coaches who participated in the pilot workshop
   reported significant improvements in depression literacy, intentions to
   seek self-help for oneself and their athletes, and knowledge and
   confidence to provide help. In addition, coaches reported positive
   impressions of the workshop during the follow-up interviews and provided
   concrete examples of program content application. An important
   suggestion made by coaches was the need to align the workshop content to
   governing policy. Taken together, this pilot mental health literacy
   workshop for youth sport coaches shows strong promise and is ready for
   large-scale dissemination.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {16},
Month = {JUN 3},
Abstract = {Background: Adolescent anxiety's underlying mechanisms remain unclear,
   which undermines adolescents' social functioning. This study examined
   the moderating role of mental health literacy in the relationship
   between adolescent anxiety and psychological vulnerability. Methods: A
   cross-sectional study was conducted on 1,591 middle and high school
   students through online questionnaires in January 2023 in Guizhou
   Province, China. The Psychological Vulnerability Scale, Mental Health
   Literacy Scale, and Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders
   were used to measure psychological vulnerability, mental health
   literacy, anxiety, and its five dimensions, including panic/somatic,
   generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, social phobia, and school
   phobia in adolescents, respectively. Results: Psychological
   vulnerability was significantly correlated with adolescent anxiety and
   its dimensions (p < 0.05). The moderating role of mental health literacy
   on the relationship between psychological vulnerability and adolescent
   anxiety was left marginally significant (p = 0.07). Furthermore, mental
   health literacy significantly weakened the relationship between
   psychological vulnerability and social phobia (p < 0.05). The upward
   trend of anxiety as psychological vulnerability increases among the high
   mental health literacy group was significantly slower than the low
   mental health literacy group. Conclusion: Those findings suggest
   educators should develop curriculum resources to strengthen the
   cultivation of mental health literacy among adolescents to promote
   adolescent mental health.},

Abstract = {Evidence-based stigma reduction interventions for student-athletes
   exist, but researchers have focused on assessing their effectiveness
   with little attention paid to understanding how participants experience
   such programs. The current study aimed to qualitatively evaluate a
   mental illness destigmatization intervention delivered to 35 National
   Collegiate Athletic Association Division I student athletes. The program
   consisted of four weekly 1 hr empirically based sessions. Program-level
   results showed that participants increased their understanding of
   student-athlete mental health and identified actionable ways to combat
   stigma. Session-level results revealed intervention components impacted
   knowledge and application consistent with their theoretical
   underpinnings (i.e., mental health literacy). Practical guidelines based
   on the findings suggest stigma reduction interventions aimed at
   student-athletes should provide information specific to the athletic
   context (i.e., common symptoms experienced by athletes), consider
   content that moves beyond mental health literacy (e.g., contact-based
   interventions), and present opportunities for participants to apply what
   they have learned (i.e., roll play displaying empathy).},

Abstract = {By addressing the academic imperative for mental health education and
   crisis intervention, this exploratory study evaluates the desirability
   and availability of undergraduate education in recognizing and
   supporting mental health conditions and crises in hospitality and
   tourism industry settings. Hospitality and tourism management faculty
   and undergraduate students were surveyed through an online survey. The
   majority of faculty and students agreed mental health is important to
   learn in the classroom to prepare for industry, yet the majority have
   neither taught nor learned about mental health education and crisis
   intervention. The findings contribute to how educational leadership
   influences mental health training integration in classroom instruction.
   Recommendations included conducting feasibility studies with hospitality
   management educators on the integration of mental health in classroom
   learning; conducting larger, more generalizable studies on the effects
   of such education; and integrating effective mental health and crisis
   intervention training for hospitality management educators and students
   into curricula across the field.},

Title = {Evaluating the effect of an adapted mental health literacy intervention
   on mental health related stigma among secondary students in Germany:
   results of a pre-post evaluation study},
Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Month = {OCT 10},
Abstract = {BackgroundMost mental health problems develop during youth, with about
   three quarter emerging before age 25. In adolescence, stigmatizing
   attitudes related to mental illness become more nuanced and consolidate
   into one's belief system. As the stigma of mental illness is still one
   of the leading barriers to help-seeking, intervention measures should
   explicitly address it before it becomes entrenched over time. Preventive
   measures, for example, based on promoting mental health literacy (MHL),
   can be used to address and tackle stigmatizing attitudes. The Canadian
   MHL-based intervention ``the Guide{''} was translated and adapted for
   the use in German schools. The present study evaluates the effect of the
   German version of the Guide on attitudes towards mental illness among
   students in Germany.MethodsThe first-time application of the Guide
   (German version) was evaluated with a pre-post-evaluation study with an
   intervention and a control group. The evaluation data of 188 students
   (intervention group n = 106, control group n = 82) were statistically
   analyzed focusing on the outcomes social stigma, social distance, and
   self-stigma.ResultsThe analysis showed that participants do not tend to
   hold stigmatizing attitudes even before the intervention. Nevertheless,
   the intervention was effective in reducing social stigma, but not in
   reducing social distance and self-stigma. Neither gender, pre-existing
   experience with mental illness, nor the delivery modality of the contact
   element within the intervention (speaker vs. video) seemed to influence
   the outcomes.ConclusionsThe German version of the MHL-based
   intervention, the Guide, seems to be a suitable intervention to improve
   attitudes towards mental illness among students in Germany. More
   extensive research is necessary to confirm the findings and further
   explore factors that influence the program's effects on attitudes short-
   and long-term.},

Abstract = {Good mental health literacy in young people and their key helpers may
   lead to better outcomes for those with mental disorders, either by
   facilitating early help-seeking by young people themselves, or by
   helping adults to identify early signs of mental disorders and seek help
   on their behalf.
   Few interventions to improve mental health literacy of young people and
   their helpers have been evaluated, and even fewer have been well
   evaluated.
   There are four categories of interventions to improve mental health
   literacy: whole-of-community campaigns; community campaigns aimed at a
   youth audience; school-based interventions teaching help-seeking skills,
   mental health literacy, or resilience; and programs training individuals
   to better intervene in a mental health crisis.
   The effectiveness of future interventions could be enhanced by using
   specific health promotion models to guide their development.},

Title = {Process evaluation of Ahead of the Game: Underlying mechanisms of a
   sports-based mental health literacy intervention},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED SPORT PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 JUL 7},
Abstract = {This study comprises a process evaluation, examining the implementation
   of the athlete component of a sports-based mental health literacy
   intervention, Ahead of the Game (AOTG). We investigated the mechanisms
   driving intervention outcomes, as well as intended and unintended
   effects. Twenty-three adolescent males (ages 12-17) who had recently
   participated in Help Out a Mate and Your Path to Success were invited to
   partake in dyads (n = 4) or focus groups (n = 5). We used reflexive
   thematic analysis to analyse the data. Participants reported
   improvements in knowledge of depression and anxiety literacy, perceived
   importance of help-seeking, greater confidence to seek help and support
   peers experiencing mental health difficulties, alongside shifts in
   language, attitudes, and willingness to have conversations about mental
   health. Unintended outcomes included trickle-down effects; participants
   reported that the program benefitted those who did not engage with AOTG.
   Participants also described strengthened team cohesion through shared
   learning experiences and vulnerability. These findings highlight the
   need for evaluating brief mental-health literacy programs in sports
   settings, given that benefits may extend beyond intended effects of the
   program, whilst remaining acceptable, feasible, and sustainable. We
   suggest strategies and key takeaways to improve participation,
   engagement, and implementation of sports-based mental health literacy
   interventions.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare the knowledge and beliefs about

   Canadian and 28 European Canadian parents of elementary school-aged
   children completed questionnaires measuring ADHD knowledge, treatment
   attitudes and perceived stigma, both before and after reading an
   informational pamphlet about ADHD. Compared with European Canadian
   parents, Chinese Canadian parents initially had less knowledge and more
   stigma about ADHD but had greater increases in knowledge and medication
   acceptability after passive psychoeducation. For both groups, passive
   psychoeducation increased ADHD stigma, but did not impact the already
   high acceptability for parent training intervention. Passive
   psychoeducation can improve mental health literacy among ethnic minority
   groups, but further work needs to tailor resources to address specific
   gaps in mental health literacy and recognize the need for concurrent

Title = {Ahead of the game protocol: a multi-component, community sport-based
   program targeting prevention, promotion and early intervention for
   mental health among adolescent males},
Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Month = {MAR 21},
Abstract = {Background: There is a recognised need for targeted community-wide
   mental health strategies and interventions aimed specifically at
   prevention and early intervention in promoting mental health. Young
   males are a high need group who hold particularly negative attitudes
   towards mental health services, and these views are detrimental for
   early intervention and help-seeking. Organised sports provide a
   promising context to deliver community-wide mental health strategies and
   interventions to adolescent males. The aim of the Ahead of the Game
   program is to test the effectiveness of a multi-component,
   community-sport based program targeting prevention, promotion and early
   intervention for mental health among adolescent males.
   Methods: The Ahead of the Game program will be implemented within a
   sample drawn from community sporting clubs and evaluated using a sample
   drawn from a matched control community. Four programs are proposed,
   including two targeting adolescents, one for parents, and one for sports
   coaches. One adolescent program aims to increase mental health literacy,
   intentions to seek and/or provide help for mental health, and to
   decrease stigmatising attitudes. The second adolescent program aims to
   increase resilience. The goal of the parent program is to increase
   parental mental health literacy and confidence to provide help. The
   coach program is intended to increase coaches' supportive behaviours
   (e.g., autonomy supportive behaviours), and in turn facilitate
   high-quality motivation and wellbeing among adolescents. Programs will
   be complemented by a messaging campaign aimed at adolescents to enhance
   mental health literacy. The effects of the program on adolescent males'
   psychological distress and wellbeing will also be explored.
   Discussion: Organised sports represent a potentially engaging avenue to
   promote mental health and prevent the onset of mental health problems
   among adolescent males. The community-based design, with samples drawn
   from an intervention and a matched control community, enables evaluation
   of adolescent males' incremental mental health literacy, help-seeking
   intentions, stigmatising attitudes, motivation, and resilience impacts
   from the multi-level, multi-component Ahead of the Game program. Notable
   risks to the study include self-selection bias, the non-randomised
   design, and the translational nature of the program. However, strengths
   include extensive community input, as well as the multi-level and
   multi-component design.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveThere is growing evidence that climate change can negatively
   impact people's mental health. Therefore, it is important for
   psychologists to receive adequate training in this area. However, little
   is known about current levels of training, including the amount of
   climate change mental health education within postgraduate psychology
   programs in Australia and Aotearoa-New Zealand.MethodTwo cross-sectional
   surveys regarding climate change and mental health were emailed to
   postgraduate psychology programs in Australia and Aotearoa-New Zealand.
   The first invited participation from program coordinators (n = 17), the
   second students (n = 159). We conducted quantitative content analysis
   and thematic analysis of qualitative responses.ResultsMost participants
   believe this is an important topic of training for psychologists as
   climate change will impact the mental health of their clients. Further,
   results indicate minimal climate change mental health content in
   postgraduate psychology training programs in Australia and Aotearoa-New
   Zealand.ConclusionsIntegration of climate change mental health education
   into postgraduate psychology curriculum will work towards equipping the
   emerging mental health workforce to address this growing demand, which
   in turn can improve mental health outcomes in a changing climate.
   What is already known about this topic: Climate change negatively
   impacts mental health in several ways.These impacts will increase as
   climate change increases.Climate change mental health education is not
   currently an Australian Psychology Accreditation Council or New Zealand
   Psychologists Board Accreditation Committee requirement for postgraduate
   psychology programs.What this study adds: This is the first study to
   investigate the perceptions of students and program coordinators
   regarding climate change mental health, and education on this topic
   within postgraduate psychology programs in Australia and Aotearoa-New
   Zealand.We found that: Almost all participants believe that climate
   change will negatively impact the mental health of their clients and
   most participants believe climate change and mental health education
   ought to be incorporated into programs, however the majority indicated
   it is not presently included.It is important to prepare the emerging
   psychology workforce in mental health and climate change and integrating
   education into postgraduate psychology programs represents a step
   forward.},

Abstract = {The mental health literacy of parents may be critical in facilitating
   positive child and adolescent mental health outcomes. The purpose of
   this study was to develop, pilot, and evaluate a targeted parent mental
   health literacy intervention through community sports clubs. Sixty six
   parents (M (age) = 44.86 +/- 5.2 years) participated in either a brief
   mental health literacy intervention workshop delivered through community
   sporting clubs (n = 42) or a community-matched control group (n = 24).
   Participants' mental health literacy was assessed at baseline,
   post-intervention and at 1 month follow-up. A mixed methods process
   evaluation was conducted with intervention participants to determine the
   acceptability and feasibility of the intervention. Participants in the
   experimental group showed greater increases in depression literacy,
   anxiety literacy, knowledge of help seeking options and confidence to
   assist an adolescent experiencing a mental health disorder, compared to
   those in the control group. Post-intervention changes in the
   experimental group were maintained at 1 month follow-up. A mixed methods
   process evaluation revealed that parents found the intervention content
   engaging, relevant to their needs, and practically useful in terms of
   actively supporting adolescent mental health. Findings provide evidence
   that a brief, targeted intervention through community sports clubs might
   be a particularly useful method of improving parental mental health
   literacy and facilitating positive youth mental health outcomes.},

Abstract = {Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to present the findings of a preliminary
   study based on a novel structured mental health education programme -
   Innate Health Education and Resilience Training (iHEART) - in a cohort
   of secondary school adolescents in the UK.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A curriculum-based ten-week programme was delivered by trained
   facilitators. In total, 205 students enrolled in the study. An
   additional 64 participants were within an age-matched non-intervention
   control group. A non-randomised control mixed methodology approach was
   used. All students, pre- and post-programme, completed a quantitative
   questionnaire - the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Survey.
   Qualitative measures were used to assess participants' perceptions of
   changes in their resilience and mental well-being.
   Findings
   Those who received the intervention showed a small improvement in mental
   well-being relative to those who did not, with a similar change in
   resilience. Qualitative findings regarding impulse control and emotional
   resilience provided positive findings.
   Originality/value
   iHEART may be a promising new intervention offering a step change in
   mental health education for improving resilience, mental well-being and
   the ability for participants to navigate psychological challenges.},

Title = {`teen Mental Health First Aid': a description of the program and an
   initial evaluation},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JAN 19},
Abstract = {Background: Many adolescents have poor mental health literacy,
   stigmatising attitudes towards people with mental illness, and lack
   skills in providing optimal Mental Health First Aid to peers. These
   could be improved with training to facilitate better social support and
   increase appropriate help-seeking among adolescents with emerging mental
   health problems. teen Mental Health First Aid (teen MHFA), a new
   initiative of Mental Health First Aid International, is a 3 x 75 min
   classroom based training program for students aged 15-18 years.
   Methods: An uncontrolled pilot of the teen MHFA course was undertaken to
   examine the feasibility of providing the program in Australian secondary
   schools, to test relevant measures of student knowledge, attitudes and
   behaviours, and to provide initial evidence of program effects.
   Results: Across four schools, 988 students received the teen MHFA
   program. 520 students with a mean age of 16 years completed the baseline
   questionnaire, 345 completed the post-test and 241 completed the
   three-month follow-up. Statistically significant improvements were found
   in mental health literacy, confidence in providing Mental Health First
   Aid to a peer, help-seeking intentions and student mental health, while
   stigmatising attitudes significantly reduced.
   Conclusions: teen MHFA appears to be an effective and feasible program
   for training high school students in Mental Health First Aid techniques.
   Further research is required with a randomized controlled design to
   elucidate the causal role of the program in the changes observed.},

Abstract = {Objective: The present study aims to evaluate the contribution in terms
   of the Mental Health First Aid program's effectiveness in mental health
   literacy about depression, based on a sample of nursing students when
   entering and integrating into the course. Method: A pre-experimental
   design with a single group design, pre- and post-intervention assessment
   was used. The program lasted one day (9 hours). The study sample
   consisted of 100 students from the 1st year of the Nursing course (in
   the integration to the course), having been selected in a simple random
   way using the software random. org. The average age was 18.54 years (SD
   = 2.00 years). For data collection, we used the Mental Health Literacy
   Assessment Questionnaire, applied to depression, the short version of
   the Beliefs about Mental Illnesses Inventory, and the Personal Stigma
   Assessment Scale. We calculated summary statistics, McNemar and
   Student's t-tests for paired groups, and measures of effect size, the g,
   and d, respectively. Results: An increase in mental health literacy was
   observed with the recognition of depression and communication strategies
   for providing first aid (p < .05), specifically in the adequacy and
   usefulness of valuing symptoms and not expressing judgments, as well as
   a reduction in stigmatizing attitudes about disorders and patients (p <
   0.05). Conclusions: Despite the limitations related to the design used,
   namely the lack of a control group, the results indicate that the
   frequency of the program contributes to increase mental health literacy
   about depression and reduce the stigma associated with mental health
   problems.},

Journal = {MENTAL HEALTH \& PREVENTION},
Year = {2023},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Community sports coaches and leaders can have an important role to play
   as informal resources for sporting adolescents and adults at risk of
   mental ill-health. Supporting coach mental health literacy using
   programs has potential to enhance opportunities for coach-player
   support. This study aimed to evaluate a community sport mental health
   literacy program and its capacity to improve club leader confidence to
   support and refer (primary outcome), awareness of resources, beliefs
   about mental health and stigmatizing attitudes (social distance). A
   cluster-randomized controlled evaluation was conducted with measures
   taken at baseline (around 2 weeks prior to intervention), immediately
   post-program and at a nine-month follow up. Twenty-five community
   Australian Rules Football clubs from metropolitan and regional centres
   were sampled and matched by size and location. Coaches or sport leaders
   (n n = 265) were randomized by club to either the intervention group or
   a waitlist control group. A multivariate analysis of variance (pre-test
   scores as covariates) revealed participants in the `Tackle Your
   Feelings' (TYF) program reported improved outcomes compared to controls
   on measures tied to leader confidence to support and refer, knowledge of
   resources to support mental health, general help-seeking and
   stigmatizing attitudes tied to social distance. A fifth measure of
   beliefs about mental illness was not impacted by the program. A
   nine-month comparison group follow-up indicated some decay in scores
   over time. The results suggest that TYF programs can be effective at
   improving coach mental health literacy in community sporting club
   contexts.},

Abstract = {Objective: This study aimed to assess the impact of mental health
   literacy education on the beliefs and attitudes of family physicians in
   Turkey regarding mental illnesses. Method: This study, conducted using a
   pre-test post-test experimental design with experimental and control
   groups, involved 461 physicians from 95 Family Health Centers in
   Kayseri, Turkey. Both experimental and control groups were administered
   pre-tests, followed by online mental health training for the
   experimental group, and then post-tests were conducted. Data were
   collected using the ``Personal Information Form,{''} ``Mental Health
   Literacy Scale,{''} ``Beliefs toward Mental Illness Scale,{''} and
   ``Community Attitudes toward the Mentally Ill Scale.{''} Results: Data
   from 184 physicians were analyzed, the educational intervention
   significantly improved mental health knowledge (p=0.032), help-seeking
   adequacy (p=0.043), and positive attitudes (p=0.032), while reducing
   perceptions of danger (p=0.043) among the intervention group. The study
   indicated significant enhancements in mental health knowledge and
   help-seeking adequacy among primary care physicians in Turkey following
   online mental health literacy education. However, its impact on beliefs
   and attitudes towards mental illness is comparatively modest. Further
   research is necessary for a deeper analysis of the relationships between
   these dimensions. Discussion: Mental health literacy education
   positively influences primary care physicians' knowledge and
   help-seeking behaviors regarding mental illnesses, although it has a
   relatively modest impact on their beliefs and attitudes. There is a need
   for further research to conduct a more in-depth analysis of the
   relationships between the dimensions of beliefs and attitudes towards
   mental illnesses in mental health literacy education.},

Title = {Review: School-based interventions to improve mental health literacy and

Volume = {28},

Abstract = {Background The steadily increasing prevalence of mental disorders in
   children and adolescents presents itself as a public health challenge,
   especially given the health, social and economic burden of mental
   disorders. School-based interventions aimed at improving mental health
   literacy and reducing mental health stigma have the potential to prevent
   mental disorders and promote mental well-being, thus reducing the burden
   of mental disorders. This review identified and synthesised evidence on
   the effectiveness of school-based interventions designed to improve
   mental health literacy and reduce mental health stigma. Methods
   Electronic bibliographic databases including MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO,
   Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), Child Development and
   Adolescent Studies, British Education Index and Applied Social Sciences
   Index and Abstracts (ASSIA) were searched. Randomised controlled trials
   (RCTs) were included if they assessed the effectiveness or
   cost-effectiveness of school-based intervention aimed at improving
   mental health literacy and reducing mental health stigma for children
   and young people aged 4-18 years. Quality of studies was appraised using
   the EPHPP tool. A numerical summary and a narrative description of the
   findings in relation to the research questions were synthesised. This
   systematic review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020191265). Results
   We identified 21 studies describing 20 unique school-based mental health
   interventions. Overall, there is moderate evidence suggesting that
   school-based mental health interventions can be effective in improving
   mental health literacy and reducing mental health stigma defined as
   attitudes and beliefs regarding mental disorders. However, there is less
   evidence for their long-term effectiveness, as most studies did not
   include follow-ups. Conclusions Despite exclusively including studies
   with randomised designs, intervention and methodological heterogeneity
   poses uncertainties to any conclusions made. Future research should
   focus on resolving methodological issues concerning how outcomes are
   assessed and include process evaluations to better inform the design of
   an intervention in term of its delivery and implementation.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Abstract = {Background We aimed to improve mental health referral quality of young
   people by helping educators build capacity for early identification of
   youth at risk of mental illness and facilitate referrals between the
   education and health systems.
   Methods We applied the Go-To Educator mental health literacy training
   for early identification, triage and support in 208 schools in Calgary,
   Alberta between 2013 and 2016. Students presenting to mental health
   services during this time were compared on a number of clinical, system,
   and demographic variables, based on the training status of the school
   (untrained schools; before and after training schools), using
   retrospective cohort design. Based on clinical and system data,
   bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis were employed
   to compare the three school status domains.
   Results After training, referrals differed significantly from control
   and pre-training schools. Students presenting to services from these
   schools were younger, from single parent families; were referred more
   because of adjustment and learning/attention problems; had complex
   social/family issues; thought disturbances, and harmful
   behavior/thoughts towards others. While they waited longer to be
   admitted they stayed longer in services; had more provisional comorbid
   diagnoses and demonstrated positive treatment outcomes.
   Conclusions The Go-To Educator training may be an effective intervention
   helping educators identify students at risk of mental disorders and in
   substantial need of mental health services, demonstrating improved
   linkages between education and health sectors.},

Abstract = {Background: Adolescents' mental health literacy is a topic of growing
   interest and studies have begun to explore the factors that influence
   adolescents' mental health literacy. This study investigated the
   relationship between parents' mental health literacy and adolescents'
   mental health literacy, as well as the mediating roles of parent-child
   relationship, and the moderating roles of school Methods: Questionnaires
   were distributed to adolescents and their parents at two time points
   with an interval of one month. In the first survey, 835 parents
   completed a mental health literacy scale and a parent-child relationship
   scale. In the second, 841 adolescents completed a school mental health
   service questionnaire and an adolescent mental health literacy
   assessment questionnaire. A total of 617 paired data points were matched
   (parents' age: M = 40.47, SD = 5.10; adolescents' age: M = 13.34, SD =
   0.99). Results: Bootstrapping results showed that parents' mental health
   literacy was positively associated with adolescents' mental health
   literacy. In addition, parent-child intimacy mediated the relationship
   between parents' mental health literacy and adolescents' mental health
   literacy. School mental health service moderated the relationship
   between parents' mental health literacy and parent-child intimacy and
   adolescents' mental health literacy. Conclusion: Intergenerational
   transmission of mental health literacy from parents to adolescents and
   its conditions were revealed. These findings provide new insights for
   the intervention of adolescents' mental health literacy, and may lead
   future research to investigate the role of parents within the family
   context, as well as the influence of home-school cooperation on
   adolescents' mental health literacy.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Primary healthcare workers, including doctors and
   pharmacists, are well -positioned to detect and support women
   experiencing mental health disorders in the perinatal period. However,
   research exploring their education and training to fulfil these roles is
   limited. This study aimed to examine the perspectives of medical and
   pharmacy educational program representatives on perinatal mental health
   education in medical and pharmacy curricula at Australian and New
   Zealand universities. Methods: A web -based search (e.g., Australian
   Health Practitioner Regulation Agency) was used to identify potentially
   relevant medical and pharmacy educational program representatives.
   Eligible participants were invited to participate in audio -recorded
   semi -structured interviews which were transcribed verbatim. Data
   regarding perinatal mental health content within each program were
   extracted and tabulated for comparisons. Thematic analysis of
   participants' perspectives on perinatal mental health education was
   conducted. Results: Fifty medical and pharmacy educational program
   representatives were invited to participate (December 2022 -March 2023),
   of which 13 participated representing 14 programs. The extent and
   content of perinatal mental health education varied considerably across
   programs. Thematic analysis resulted in four themes: How much perinatal
   mental health content is enough?; Reflections on perinatal mental health
   related content; Perinatal mental health education in and beyond the
   classroom; Challenges associated with delivering perinatal mental health
   content. Conclusions: Participants acknowledged the importance of
   perinatal mental health content for medical and pharmacy students;
   however, limited time and lack of opportunities for students to complete
   placements were key challenges to curricular integration.},

Title = {Compassion Fatigue Rounds (CFR): A Proactive Brief Intervention to
   Introduce Mental Health Awareness in a Veterinary Clerkship},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VETERINARY MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 19},
Abstract = {The mental health and well-being of veterinary students and graduate
   veterinarians is a critical area of concern. Veterinary students
   experience high levels of psychological distress, particularly during
   transitional periods such as clinical training. While mental health
   interventions typically target pre-clinical years, the unique challenges
   faced by clinical students are often overlooked, resulting in inadequate
   support during important periods of professional development. To address
   this gap, Compassion Fatigue Rounds (CFR) were introduced. CFR is a
   proactive, integrated intervention within one clinical clerkship
   program. The rounds address compassion fatigue, burnout, and self-care
   practices through a small group discussion facilitated by the clinical
   instructor. An evaluation of CFR was conducted through anonymous online
   student surveys administered between March and September 2023. Following
   CFR, students self-reported an increase in knowledge, confidence, and
   preparedness regarding the mental health challenges in veterinary
   medicine. Students overwhelmingly reported positive experiences,
   pointing to the potential effectiveness of CFR in educating, engaging,
   and supporting clinical students on mental health well-being. This study
   offers preliminary evidence for integrating mental health education into
   the clinical year curriculum and serves as a practical guide for
   clinical instructors.},

Abstract = {PurposeThis paper aims to evaluate the cultural appropriateness,
   readability and suitability of the school-based mental health
   curriculum, with the ultimate aim of promoting students' mental health
   literacy.Design/methodology/approachThis research was conducted in two
   stages. The first stage involved a panel of experts evaluating the
   cultural appropriateness and adaptation of the mental health curriculum
   to Iranian culture. The second stage involved randomly selecting the
   first secondary schools in Sirjan and assessing the curriculum's
   readability and suitability. Five mental health counselors and 25
   students were included in the study.FindingsThe results revealed that
   the cultural appropriateness and acceptability of the curriculum were
   verified following the implementation of cultural adjustments and
   reforms. The mean readability score for the mental health curriculum,
   measured by the readability of materials, was 13 before incorporating
   cultural appropriateness. After the inclusion of cultural
   appropriateness, the score improved to 16.5. Also, incorporating
   cultural appropriateness into the mental health curriculum increased the
   mean suitability of materials score from 62.7 to 87.2.Research
   limitations/implicationsFollowing the cultural appropriateness, the
   mental health curriculum was considered a superior medium due to its
   high score in cultural appropriateness, suitability and readability of
   materials.Practical implicationsEducational materials are recommended to
   be evaluated for appropriateness and readability before publication, and
   educational content should be tailored to the intended audience.Social
   implicationsUtilizing this program in schools can serve as a beneficial
   and efficient method to enhance students' mental health
   literacy.Originality/valueEducation professionals should ensure that
   instructional materials are appropriate for the intended audience.},

Abstract = {Background/Objectives: We aim to assess the effect of the Espaijove.net
   mental health literacy program on adolescents' quality of life (QOL).
   Additionally, we aim to describe their QOL and mental well-being.
   Methods: A multicenter, randomized, controlled trial was conducted, with
   pre- and post-intervention assessments and 6- and 12-month follow-ups. A
   total of 1032 students aged 13-14 from 18 schools in Barcelona
   participated in one of the three following mental health literacy (MHL)
   programs or were placed in a control group (CG): (1) a 1 h awareness
   session (G1h); (2) a 6 h MHL program (G6h); (3) a 7 h MHL program with
   stigma reduction (G7h). Measures: (1) Mental well-being: Strengths and
   Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ); (2) QOL: EuroQol 5D-5L with its two
   parts: the EuroQol 5D-5L Index (0-1) and EuroQol 5D-5L visual analog
   scale (EQ-VAS) (0-100). Analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat
   basis, using data imputation methods for missing data. Intervention
   effects were assessed using multilevel models. Results: Baseline EQ-VAS
   and EQ-5D-5L index scores were 77.84 (CI = 76.77-78.91) and 0.91 (CI =
   0.90-0.92), respectively. Boys reported higher QOL and SDQ scores (p <
   0.001), whereas participants of foreign nationality showed lower scores
   in QOL (EQ-VAS; p = 0.039) and mental well-being (p < 0.001).
   Post-intervention, all groups (intervention and control), except G6h,
   showed QOL improvements. However, in the 6-month follow-up, the CG
   outperformed the other groups. At 12 months, G7h achieved the highest
   EQ-VAS scores compared to the other groups. Conclusions: MHL-based
   interventions improved short-term QOL but failed to sustain these
   improvements over time. Groups with lower QOL and SDQ scores included
   girls and adolescents of foreign nationality.},

Abstract = {PurposeTo summarize the effect of mental health first aid (MHFA) on
   paramedics and medical nursing students and provide direction to future
   training and research.MethodsSeven databases, including Web of Science,
   PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, China Knowledge, Wanfang, and China Biomedical
   Literature Database, were searched for relevant studies from database
   establishment up to January 31, 2023. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was
   used to assess the quality of randomized controlled trials, qualitative
   studies, and single-armed trials on the basis of the literature
   evaluation criteria developed by the JBI Center for Evidence-Based
   Healthcare in Australia. Mixed-sex studies were assessed by using the
   mixed-methods assessment tool (MMAT 2018).ResultsThe review identified
   11 studies that met the criteria, most of which reported on the effects
   of MHFA training in terms of mental health literacy (referred to as
   MHL), MHFA intentions and confidence, stigma, and changes in social
   distance. A few studies analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of MHFA
   training courses, motivation to complete MHFA, barriers and facilitators
   to MHFA training, and participants' perceptions of implementing MHFA
   training.ConclusionsThe MHFA curriculum is practical for healthcare
   workers and medical nursing students. In the future, a standardized
   training program based on the population characteristics of healthcare
   workers and medical nursing students must be developed to standardize
   the measurement of outcome indicators to reflect the effectiveness of
   implementing the MHFA training curriculum. Our study has been registered
   to PROSPERO under registration number CRD42024519793.},

Title = {Promoting early-intervention for suicide prevention: The role of mental
   health literacy and attitudes towards suicide: A quantitative study in
   Ireland.},
Journal = {HEALTH POLICY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {149},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Suicide is a global public health issue which has far-reaching impacts
   on individuals, families, and wider communities. Early intervention is a
   core pillar of policy on the prevention of suicide related deaths.
   However, limited mental health literacy, and negative attitudes
   regarding mental illness amongst the public are a barrier to early
   intervention. Past research has not explored mental health literacy and
   attitudes regarding suicide specifically. The aim of the current study
   was to examine mental health literacy and attitudes towards suicide in
   adults. 590 adults in Ireland aged 18-80 years (M = 43.24, SD = 12.6)
   took part in this online cross-sectional study, completing the Mental
   Health Literacy Scale and The Attitudes Towards Suicide Scale.
   Experience of suicide deaths was common among participants. Independent
   t-tests indicated that males had significantly lower levels of mental
   health literacy and more stigmatising attitudes towards suicide than
   females. Young adults also had lower ability to recognise mental health
   difficulties than older adults. Hierarchical Multiple Regressions found
   that mental health literacy significantly accounted for varied attitudes
   towards suicide in adults, particularly willingness to communicate about
   suicide, and beliefs that suicide is preventable. Findings are discussed
   in the context of informing policy-makers who are promoting
   early-intervention for suicide prevention.},

Title = {Mental health literacy of school nurses in the United Arab Emirates},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {12},
Month = {JAN 22},
Abstract = {Background: To support promotion, prevention and early intervention for
   mental illness school nurses need to be mental health literate.
   Methods: Three hundred and thirty-nine school nurses employed in
   government and private schools from three Emirates in the UAE were
   surveyed. A culturally adapted Mental Health Literacy questionnaire
   comprising three vignettes of fictional characters meeting diagnostic
   criteria for the target conditions along with the Kessler Psychological
   Distress Scale (K10) was administered to ascertain school nurses'
   ability to correctly identify the conditions and to elicit beliefs about
   helpfulness of treatment interventions and of health care providers for
   these conditions.
   Results: Less than 50\% of the respondents correctly identified the
   disorders presented, while accurate identification of evidence-based
   interventions was also limited. Correlations between level of
   psychological distress and level of inaccurate survey responses was also
   revealed, respondents who correctly identified the correct diagnosis of
   the vignette and the most appropriate interventions were those who had a
   significantly lower K10 score.
   Conclusions: Low levels of mental health literacy amongst respondents in
   combination with potential religious and cultural factors as reported in
   the literature, highlight the need for curriculum enhancements for
   future health professionals and a targeted program of culturally
   appropriate professional development focused on mental health promotion
   for those in clinical practice. The level of psychological distress
   noted in this cohort also signals a need to ensure that appropriate
   supports are available for clinical staff employed in schools.},

Abstract = {BackgroundSchool mental health literacy programs, delivered at the
   universal level, are key to promoting positive behavioral health for all
   youth. Successfully implementing these programs requires adaptation to
   ensure the programs are aligned with contextual demands of the schools
   in which they are implemented. Yet, little is known about how to adapt
   and implement mental health literacy programs in school
   settings.PurposeThis article describes the process of adapting and
   implementing an educator-delivered school mental health literacy program
   in the context of a large comparative effectiveness trial. Adaptations
   are organized around ecological systems theory to provide a
   comprehensive account of the changes that were made.MethodExamples from
   11 middle schools illustrate multilevel adaptations that fostered
   implementation.ResultsA case study details specific adaptations made at
   one school to improve implementation over 3 years. Dosage data portray
   increasing trends in implementation over time.DiscussionFindings are
   contextualized alongside the adaptations that were made, highlighting
   the importance of offering flexibility in delivery, identifying
   champions, and making iterative adaptations over time in response to
   local and societal changes.Translation to Health Education PracticeThe
   article concludes with considerations to researchers and practitioners,
   including Health Educators, interested in implementing school mental
   health literacy programs.},

Abstract = {Background: It is crucial to prioritize mental health (MH) promotion
   among adolescents, as the initial onset of mental illnesses commonly
   occurs during this developmental stage. Adopting a multi-pronged
   approach to mental health literacy (MHL) may help promote adolescent
   mental well-being. Objective: We aimed to determine baseline
   adolescents' knowledge and attitudes on mental illness and any changes
   following a multidimensional MHL program. Method: A pre-post study was
   conducted among 600 adolescents in grades 10-12 recruited by multistage
   sampling in southwest Nigeria. MHL training was implemented using
   multidimensional tools which included peer-led education, MH booklets,
   posters, and role plays over a six-week period. Pre-and
   post-intervention questionnaire data on the knowledge and attitudes of
   respondents on MH issues were collected and analyzed. Results: Of 600
   students, 594 (99\%) {[}mean age of 14.87 (SD 1.44), a range of 11-21
   years, and a female: male ratio of 1.3:1] completed the study.
   Post-intervention there were significant improvements in some but not
   all domains assessed. Participants' views on care seeking and
   willingness for friendship improved post-intervention with a significant
   reduction in the concern for personal safety as a reason for
   unwillingness for friendship. Mean knowledge scores significantly
   increased from 11.89 (SD 2.56) to 13.51 (SD 2.62). Conclusions: The
   findings suggest that school-based multidimensional interventions may
   improve MHL. However, additional studies are needed to more rigorously
   assess their impact to inform effective integration of MHL into school
   curricula to enhance adolescent MHL.},

Title = {Effectiveness of a comic book intervention on mental health literacy
   among adolescents and youth in Burkina Faso: a randomized controlled
   trial protocol},
Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 9},
Abstract = {BackgroundIn Burkina Faso, nearly half of the population is under 15
   years old, and one in four adolescents experience depression. This
   underscores the critical need to enhance mental health literacy among
   adolescents and youth, empowering them to manage their mental well-being
   effectively. Comic books offer an engaging approach to health education,
   yet their effectiveness in addressing mental health remains largely
   untested. Our study aims to fill this gap by evaluating the
   effectiveness of comic books in enhancing mental health literacy among
   adolescents and young adults aged 10-24 years.MethodsWe will recruit
   2,007 participants aged 10-24, stratify them by age, and randomly assign
   them to three groups (1:1:1): a comic book intervention group
   (Intervention 1), a text-only flyer group (Intervention 2), and a
   control group with no intervention. The primary outcome will be mental
   health literacy and secondary outcomes will include anxiety, depression,
   and intentions to cope.DiscussionWe hypothesize that the comic book
   intervention and flyer intervention will prove more effective in
   improving mental health literacy than the control group. We further
   hypothesize that for younger adolescents (10-14), the comic book will be
   more effective at increasing mental health literacy than the flyer.
   Conversely, we hypothesize that the flyer will be more effective in
   increasing mental health literacy for older adolescents (15-24). Our
   study will provide evidence on novel interventions designed to enhance
   mental health literacy among adolescents and young adults in
   low-resource settings.Trial registrationThis trial has been registered
   on the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS), with the registration
   number DRKS00034242.},

Title = {Youth Mental Health First Aid Training With Diverse Educators},
Journal = {PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Pages = {941-951},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Schools are the most likely place for students to receive formal or
   informal mental health services and support. Classroom educators often
   provide informal mental health support to students and referrals to
   school-based services. Despite their key role, educators often feel
   underprepared in recognizing concerning symptoms in youth and supporting
   student mental health. This mixed-methods study explored the
   effectiveness of in-person Youth Mental Health First Aid (YMHFA)
   training on a diverse sample of 106 educators (M-age = 22, SD = 1.9
   years, 96\% ethnic minorities): City Year AmeriCorps members who work in
   diverse low-income schools in Florida. We culturally adapted the program
   to better meet the needs of the participants and the students they serve
   as over 95\% of the students they served were people of color.
   Quantitative survey data were collected at three time points (pre, post,
   and 3 months after the training) to examine whether YMHFA training
   better equipped classroom educators to support students ` mental health.
   Overall, training was associated with improvements in mental health
   literacy, knowledge of school-based mental health providers, confidence,
   and intentions to engage in mental health first aid (MHFA) behaviors.
   Notably, educators reported greater engagement in mental health first
   aid behaviors at the 3-month followup than before training. No
   improvement in mental health stigma was observed. Some improvements
   (i.e., mental health literacy, intentions to help) were not sustained at
   the follow-up. Qualitative data generally supported quantitative
   findings and suggested that the YMHFA program with cultural
   consideration is suitable for this diverse sample of classroom
   educators. Educators ` suggestions to improve the training to support
   culturally and linguistically diverse students ` mental health are
   discussed.
   Impact Statement A sample of diverse classroom educators ` mental health
   literacy, confidence, and intentions to engage in mental health first
   aid behaviors increased after attending in-person YMHFA training.
   Educators also reported greater use of mental health first aid behaviors
   at 3-month follow-up. Educators perceived the YMHFA training to be
   helpful while suggesting additional cultural adaptations.},

Journal = {SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH},

Abstract = {School-age children frequently present with mental health (MH) problems
   in school, affecting their academic experience and outcomes. However,
   school staff report difficulty in identifying and managing such
   problems. We aimed to determine whether a mental health literacy (MHL)
   intervention was effective at improving MHL for staff in an urban,
   predominately Latinx elementary school. A pre/post quasi-experimental
   design was used. A 20-week MHL intervention that is comprehensive (i.e.,
   not disorder specific) and tiered (i.e., universal as well as targeted
   services for those with greater needs) was provided as part of an
   existing school-based mental health prevention and promotion program. A
   survey adapted from validated measures of MH knowledge and attitudes
   (including self-efficacy and stigma), as well as use of student support
   services, was simultaneously administered to staff at the intervention
   school and a matched comparison school before and after the
   intervention. Linear and logistic regressions assessed whether changes
   in MHL and rates of MH referrals varied by school. After controlling for
   pre-intervention scores, staff in the intervention school had
   significantly higher knowledge scores (data), higher self-efficacy
   scores (data), and lower stigma scores (data) in the post-intervention
   period compared to the comparison school. Following the intervention,
   more staff in the intervention school reported utilizing student
   supports to discuss student needs (OR 5.8, 95\% CI 2.3-14.6). This
   intervention, which utilizes a social-ecological framework and tiered
   approach, led to improvements in MHL of school staff, which may
   facilitate staff ability to identify and support students' MH needs.},

Abstract = {Objective: This article describes Phase 1 of a pilot that aims to
   develop, implement, and test an intervention to educate and
   simultaneously engage highly stressed Latino parents in child mental
   health services. A team of Spanish-speaking academic and community
   co-investigators developed the intervention using a community-based
   participatory research approach and qualitative methods.
   Method: Through focus groups, the team identified parents' knowledge
   gaps and their health communication preferences.
   Results: Latino parents from urban communities need and welcome child
   mental health literacy interventions that integrate printed materials
   with videos, preferably in their native language, combined with guidance
   from professionals.
   Conclusion: A 3-minute video in Spanish that integrates education
   entertainment strategies and a culturally relevant format was produced
   as part of the intervention to educate and simultaneously engage highly
   stressed Latino parents in child mental health care. It is anticipated
   that the intervention will positively impact service use among this
   group.},

Title = {A Game-Based School Program for Mental Health Literacy and Stigma on
   Depression (Moving Stories): Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial},
Journal = {JMIR MENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 9},
Abstract = {Background: Depressive symptoms are highly prevalent among adolescents
   in Western countries. However, although treatment for depressive
   symptoms is available, many adolescents do not seek help when they need
   it. Important barriers to help-seeking among adolescents include low
   mental health literacy and high stigma. Therefore, we have developed a
   game-based school program, Moving Stories, which combines mental health
   literacy training for depression with contact with someone with lived
   experience both in the digital and nondigital world.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to conduct a first test of the
   effectiveness of the newly developed game-based program, Moving Stories,
   using a cluster randomized controlled trial.
   Methods: A total of 185 adolescents participated, divided over 10
   classes from 4 schools. Half of the classes were randomly selected to
   follow the Moving Stories program, whereas the other half were in the
   control group, where no intervention was provided. The adolescents
   filled out digital questionnaires at 4 time points, with questions on
   mental health literacy, stigma, depressive symptoms, and the program
   itself (before the program, after the program, 3-month follow-up, and
   6-month follow-up). Using R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing), we
   ran linear mixed-effects models for all continuous outcome variables and
   generalized linear mixed-effects models for all binary outcome
   variables.
   Results: Compared with the control group, participants in the Moving
   Stories group improved after the program in personal stigma (b=-0.53,
   95\% CI -1.02 to -0.03; t(179.16)=-2.08; P=.04). Effects on personal
   stigma lasted over time (3-month follow-up: b=-0.57, 95\% CI -1.11 to
   -0.03; t(174.39)=-2.07; P=.04). Most adolescents in the Moving Stories
   group participated in the introduction (97/99, 98\%) and contact session
   (93/99, 94\%), played the game for 4 or 5 days (83/99, 83\%), and
   indicated that they would recommend the game to their peers (90/98,
   92\%).
   Conclusions: The results of this study show the potential of Moving
   Stories as a stigma reduction program. With changes in the program to
   improve its effects on mental health literacy, Moving Stories could be
   implemented in schools to improve help-seeking in adolescents and reduce
   the negative consequences and burden of depressive symptoms.},

Title = {Bridging the gap in mental health literacy: co-adapting and feasibility
   testing a digital intervention to improve mental health literacy amongst
   young people aged 12-14 in the UK},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2025},

Abstract = {Background Digital interventions have shown promise in enhancing mental
   health literacy among young people (YP). Initially developed in
   Indonesia, the Improving Mental Health Literacy Among Young People in
   Indonesia (IMPeTUs) intervention is a co-produced digital application
   designed to improve mental health literacy and self-management of
   anxiety and depression in YP. This study aimed to co-adapt the IMPeTUs
   intervention with YP in the UK and evaluate the feasibility of
   conducting a future definitive trial in education and community
   settings.Methods The study consisted of two phases. Phase 1 involved
   co-adapting the intervention through consultations with 49 stakeholders,
   including YP, parents, and professionals, using principles of
   experience-based co-design. `Co-adapting' and `co-creating' refer to
   collaborative modification and development of intervention content with
   stakeholders. Then, Phase 2 was a multi-site, cluster-randomized
   feasibility trial with a nested mixed-methods process evaluation
   conducted at two community sites (N = 19, 12 completing 4-week
   post-intervention data and 11 completing 3-month follow-up). The `nested
   process evaluation' assessed acceptability and engagement alongside the
   trial.Results In Phase 1, the digital intervention was co-adapted with
   stakeholders to include expanded customization options, UK-specific
   content, and a new chapter on resilience, healthy relationships and
   self-care to improve engagement and support mental health literacy.
   Phase 2 showed the application was well-received, with YP appreciating
   its relatable storylines and problem-solving focus. Recruitment
   challenges and lengthy questionnaires highlighted the need for improved
   partnerships with schools and streamlined data collection. Despite these
   issues, the usability of the core design was validated, and
   recommendations to enhance engagement, such as reducing text and adding
   interactive features, were identified. Exploratory analyses suggested
   potential improvements in mental health literacy and well-being,
   although these results require confirmation in a well-powered
   trial.Conclusion This study highlights the feasibility of co-adapting
   and implementing digital interventions to improve mental health literacy
   among YP within community settings. Future work should focus on refining
   recruitment strategies for school environments, streamlining data
   collection, and enhancing engagement features to ensure scalability and
   effectiveness in large-scale evaluations. These findings lay the
   foundation for further development and rigorous digital mental health
   literacy intervention assessment.Clinical trial registration

Abstract = {Having an adequate knowledge of mental disorders is valuable for
   recognizing, preventing and treating them effectively This study
   explored the adolescence's general knowledge of mental disorders (mental
   health literacy) in Surakarta, Indonesia. Date was collected by an open
   ended questionaire developed from Jorm's theory of mental health
   literacy. There were 130 students from 5 junior dan senior high schools
   in Surakarta who participated in this study. Descriptive analysis was
   taken to all data. Result showed that students's mental health literacy
   were not adequate. Their knowledge about mental disorder were not
   comprehensive Behavioral symptoms of mental disorders were easier to be
   recognized than emotional and cognitive symptoms. They stated that
   stress, lack of self confident, lack of problems solving skill as mental
   disorders than psychological problems. The students only knew single
   factor that was responsible for mental disorders. Some of them knew the
   proper prevention and early intervention for people with mental
   disorders, but some did not know. Consequently, the mental health
   literacy course is needed for the students to increase their skill to
   recognize simptoms of mental disorders and to support them with an
   adequate prevention dan early intervention.},

Title = {A scoping review of mental health literacy in performing and creative
   artists: identifying current gaps and future directions},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {16},
Month = {AUG 22},
Abstract = {Introduction Mental health literacy is a multifaceted construct that
   consists of helping individuals recognize the early warning signs of
   mental health conditions, understanding the concept of stigma and
   misconceptions associated with mental illness, encouraging appropriate
   help-seeking behaviors, and facilitating access to mental health
   services. However, mental health literacy remains a largely unexplored
   topic in artists' health literature. This scoping review examines the
   conceptualization, operationalization, and measurement of mental health
   literacy in performing and creative artists.Methods We conducted a
   comprehensive search across multiple databases, including MEDLINE,
   CINAHL, PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Cochrane. Our
   search was designed to identify articles relevant to mental health
   literacy among artists, encompassing aspects related to the
   understanding, identification, and education of mental health
   conditions. Two independent reviewers conducted both abstract and
   full-text screenings. Our findings are synthesized using the four
   components of mental health literacy as a framework for
   organization.Results Of the 669 unique citations, 26 articles met the
   inclusion criteria; of these, 23 focused on performing artists. The
   articles were published between 1997 and 2024, with at least 4,710
   participants from nine countries. Only one study included a definition
   of mental health literacy. Sixteen articles included one of the four
   components of mental health literacy, nine included two, four included
   three, and one had all four components.Discussion Despite the high
   prevalence of mental health challenges among performing and creative
   artists, there is a disproportionately low number of interventions aimed
   at increasing mental health literacy compared to other fields, such as
   sports medicine and education. This highlights the need for more
   comprehensive efforts to increase awareness and understanding of mental
   health issues among artists. Furthermore, the lack of consensus on the
   conceptualization, operationalization, and measurement of mental health
   literacy in this field prompts further research. A standardized
   definition and validated instrument could facilitate more robust
   research on mental health literacy in the artists' health literature and
   help identify effective interventions. Future research can build on this
   review to develop and evaluate interventions aiming to improve mental
   health literacy in artists.},

Abstract = {Background: teen Mental Health First Aid (tMHFA) is a classroom-based
   training programme for students aged 15-18years to improve supportive
   behaviours towards peers, increase mental health literacy and reduce
   stigma. This research evaluated tMHFA by comparing it to a matched
   emergency Physical First Aid (PFA) training programme.
   Methods: A cluster-randomised crossover trial matched four public
   schools in two pairs and then randomised each to first receive tMHFA or
   PFA for all Year 10 students. In the subsequent calendar year, the new
   Year 10 cohort received the opposite intervention, giving eight cohorts.
   Online surveys were administered at baseline and 1week post-training,
   measuring quality of first aid intentions, mental health literacy,
   problem recognition and stigmatising beliefs, towards fictional
   adolescents with depression and suicidality (John) and social anxiety
   (Jeanie).
   Results: A total of 1942 students were randomised (979 received tMHFA,
   948 received PFA), 1605 (84\%) analysed for the John vignette at
   baseline and 1116 (69\% of baseline) provided post-training data. The
   primary outcomes, helpful first aid intentions' towards John/Jeanie,
   showed significant group-by-time interactions with medium effect sizes
   favouring tMHFA (ds=0.50-0.58). Compared to PFA, tMHFA students also
   reported significantly greater improvements in confidence supporting a
   peer (ds=0.22-0.37) and number of adults rated as helpful (ds=0.45-0.46)
   and greater reductions in stigmatising beliefs (ds=0.12-0.40) and
   harmful first aid intentions' towards John/Jeanie (ds=0.15-0.41).
   Conclusions: tMHFA is an effective and feasible programme for increasing
   supportive first aid intentions and mental health literacy in
   adolescents in the short term. tMHFA could be widely disseminated to
   positively impact on help seeking for adolescent mental illness.},

Title = {Improving mental health literacy in year 9 high school children across

Abstract = {BackgroundAdolescence is a crucial period for developing and maintaining
   good habits for mental health and well-being. This is important for
   future mental health, as most mental health problems manifest during
   adolescence. Mental health literacy is the foundation for mental health
   prevention, stigma reduction, and increased help-seeking efficacy
   particularly among adolescents. The mental health literacy programme
   ``The Guide{''}, which was developed in Canada, has shown success in
   increasing mental health literacy in North American 16-17year olds.
   ``The Guide Cymru{''} is an adaptation of The Guide designed for a
   younger age group (13-14year olds) and for the Welsh culture and context
   and is being offered to all state schools in Wales.MethodsThis two-armed
   cluster randomised control trial (RCT) will evaluate the effectiveness
   of The Guide Cymru. All 205 secondary schools in Wales will be invited
   to take part, involving up to 30,000year 9 pupils. Schools will be
   randomised to either the immediate implementation of The Guide Cymru or
   to a wait-list control. The wait-list control will receive The Guide
   Cymru around 12weeks later. Measures of mental health literacy (assessed
   via the Knowledge and Attitudes to Mental Health scale) and mental
   health problems (via the PedsQL and Strengths and Difficulties
   Questionnaire) will be taken at baseline (pre-intervention), 12weeks
   later (after the active group has received The Guide Cymru), and 24weeks
   later (after the wait-list control has received The Guide
   Cymru).DiscussionThe trial aims to evaluate if The Guide Cymru increases
   mental health literacy, including reduced stigma to others and to the
   self, and increased levels of good mental health behaviours and
   help-seeking for mental health problems.Trial

Abstract = {AimThis study evaluated an online mental health literacy intervention to
   improve help-seeking for psychosis amongst parents of adolescents.
   MethodsA total of 2496 parents of first-grade junior high school
   students, recruited from a Japan-based survey company, participated in a
   randomized controlled trial in July 2016; participants were randomly
   allocated to the intervention (n = 1248) or control group (n = 1248).
   They were assessed at baseline and one-week post intervention. The
   intervention group received a 30-minute online educational programme
   that included a narrative of the mother of an adolescent with psychosis.
   ResultsThere were no between-group differences in changes in the rate of
   `no help-seeking' in any hypothetical situations of a child's psychosis
   and prodromal symptoms. ConclusionsThe intervention might have been
   suboptimal to improve mental health literacy for psychosis amongst
   parents of adolescents. A narrative message from a service user may be
   helpful to encourage parents in help-seeking.},

Abstract = {Parents' perceptions of their children's mental health-including
   recognition of specific mental health problems as such, and their
   beliefs about the causes and treatments for the problems-have an
   important impact on child mental health. This study investigated child
   mental health literacy among Cambodian and Vietnamese mothers. A
   cross-sectional study was conducted among 357 mothers in Hanoi, Vietnam,
   and Pnom Penh and Kampong Speu, Cambodia. The Child Mental Health
   Literacy Questionnaire was used to assess mothers' mental health
   literacy, in particular, their ability to correctly identify different
   mental health disorders, and their understanding of causes of the mental
   health problems, and about the utility of different treatments. The
   overall level of mental health literacy among mothers in these two
   countries was low, with the proportions of mothers able to correctly
   identify different mental health problems ranging from 0.17
   (Oppositional Defiant Disorder) to 0.35 (Trauma-related). Biological
   causes and adverse experiences were the most frequently selected causes
   of generic mental health problems. Medication, parent training and
   family counseling were the three most positively rated forms of
   treatment for mental health problems in general. Although Vietnam and
   Cambodia are geographic neighbors, varying results across these
   countries appear to reflect their different historical backgrounds. For
   instance, the largest difference between the two countries was for
   trauma-related problems, which may be related to the Cambodian history
   of genocide. Findings such as this demonstrate the need for contextually
   developed and focused public health intervention for mothers of children
   to improve their mental health literacy.},

Abstract = {Although there is substantial evidence for the merits of integrating
   social and emotional learning (SEL) into educational settings, little
   empirical research on this learning approach has been conducted in
   Mainland China. We synthesized the frameworks of Western SEL and the
   guidelines of Chinese mental health education, and conducted a
   preliminary assessment of a short-term SEL curriculum that we designed
   and piloted in an elementary school. We randomly assigned two classes
   comprising 111 fifth-grade students to take the SEL curriculum
   (intervention group), and compared them with a third class comprising 53
   fifth-grade students assigned the usual curriculum (control group). The
   results show that the intervention group had a significant increase in
   emotional intelligence scores after completing the activities in the
   curriculum, and the control group experienced an increase in feelings of
   competitiveness. Students in the intervention group generally perceived
   the SEL curriculum as striking the right balance between enjoyable
   activities and valuable learning. Our findings imply that it would be a
   positive educational development to design SEL curricula for systematic
   use across multiple grades, thus weaving these into the formal Chinese
   elementary school system.},

Title = {A systematic mapping review of interventions to improve adolescent
   mental health literacy, attitudes and behaviours},
Journal = {EARLY INTERVENTION IN PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},

Pages = {1470-1501},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Aim: The onset of mental illness is most common in adolescence,
   therefore mental health promotion efforts frequently target this age
   group. Evaluation literature in this area is largely segmented into
   specific domains in terms of settings, countries, and/or groups of young
   people, but an overall understanding and comparison across these areas
   is lacking. The current review aims to provide such an overview of
   interventions/programs which attempt to improve adolescents' mental
   health literacy, attitudes/stigma and behaviours.
   Methods: A systematic mapping review synthesized the strengths and
   weaknesses of published interventions/programs to improve mental health
   outcomes in youth. Ten databases and grey literature sources were
   searched, and results were categorized according to sample,
   location/setting, type of information presented, delivery and testing
   procedures, mental health outcome/s evaluated, and limitations.
   Results: One hundred and forty articles met the inclusion criteria; 126
   were original records and 14 were reviews. Mental health literacy and
   attitudes/stigma were examined most frequently, and studies were
   predominantly conducted in school-based environments and high income
   economies. Intervention/program effectiveness varied across outcome/s
   measured, setting, and control group usage, with mental health literacy
   exhibiting the most positive changes overall. Common limitations
   included no long-term follow up or control group inclusion.
   Conclusions: Despite generally positive changes seen throughout studies
   in this area, effectiveness differed across a range of methodological
   domains. Most research is conducted in schools and higher income
   economies, but the lack of investigation in other contexts (i.e.,
   internet or community) or lower income countries suggests our
   understanding in this area is constrained.},

Title = {School-based mental health promotion in children and adolescents with

   protocol for a randomized controlled trial within the ProHEAD Consortium},
Journal = {TRIALS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {20},
Month = {JAN 18},
Abstract = {BackgroundSchools are an ideal setting in which to promote health.
   However, empirical data on the effectiveness of school-based mental
   health promotion programs are rare, and research on universal
   Internet-based prevention in schools is almost non-existent. Following
   the life skills approach, stress management training is an important
   component of health promotion. Mental health literacy is also associated
   with mental health status, and it facilitates formal help-seeking by
   children and adolescents (C\&A). The main objectives of this study are
   (1) the development and evaluation of an Internet-based version of a
   universal school-based health promotion program called StresSOS and (2)
   demonstrating non-inferiority of the online setting compared to the
   face-to-face setting. StresSOS aims to improve stress management and
   mental health literacy in C\&A.Methods/designA school-based sample of
   15,000 C\&A (grades 6-13 and older than 12years) will be recruited in
   five regions of Germany within the ProHEAD Consortium. Those with a
   screening result at baseline indicating no mental health problems will
   be invited to participate in a randomized controlled trial comparing
   StresSOS online to an active online control condition (Study A). In
   addition, 420 adolescents recruited as a separate school-based sample
   will participate in the StresSOS face-to-face intervention. Participants
   in both intervention groups (online or face-to-face) will receive the
   same eight treatment modules to allow for the comparison of both methods
   of delivery (Study B). The primary outcome is the number of C\&A with
   symptoms of mental health problems at a 12 months follow-up. Secondary
   outcomes are related to stress/coping (i.e., knowledge, symptoms of
   stress, coping resources), mental health literacy (knowledge and
   attitudes toward mental disorders and help-seeking), program usage
   patterns, cost-effectiveness, and acceptability of the
   intervention.DiscussionThis study represents the first adequately
   powered non-inferiority trial in the area of school-based mental health
   promotion. If online StresSOS proves efficacious and non-inferior to
   face-to-face delivery, this offers great potential for health promotion
   in youths, both in and outside the school environment.Trial

Abstract = {This is a narrative review of the latest peer-reviewed social work
   literature on the child protection work with parents. Aiming to identify
   knowledge gaps, the study researches the mental health aspects of the
   implicit or explicit theoretical perspectives underpinning the
   assessment and intervention with parents. An electronic database search
   extracted 38 peer-reviewed journal articles. It was found that the
   theoretical perspectives the publications adopted were the managerial,
   the critical, the humanistic, the psychodynamic and the behavioural. The
   study identified mental health knowledge gaps in the assessment and
   intervention work with parents across all theoretical perspectives and
   stressed the need for process and effectiveness studies on the work with
   parents, under explicit theoretical perspectives. The study finally
   highlights the need for the social work profession to increase its
   mental health literacy through mental health education for students and
   practitioners alike.},

Abstract = {Adolescents are at increased risk of mental illness and prefer to seek
   help from informal supports. By increasing knowledge and skills, peers
   may act as gatekeepers to mental health services. The aim of the current
   study was to assess the effects of a brief sports-based mental health
   literacy program to increase competencies and intentions to both provide
   and seek help for mental health problems among adolescent male sports
   participants. A cluster-randomized controlled trial was conducted with
   measures taken at 3 time points: baseline (2 weeks prior to
   intervention), immediately postintervention, and at 1-month follow-up.
   Adolescents were randomized to either the intervention group (n = 47) or
   a waitlist control group (n = 55) at a team level (n(teams) = 9).
   Participants were 102 male adolescents 12-18 years of age (M = 14.30, SD
   = 1.75) from a community football club in New South Wales, Australia. A
   45-min Help Out a Mate (HOAM) workshop was delivered around a usual team
   practice session. Compared to the waitlist control, participants in the
   HOAM condition reported significant increases in knowledge of signs and
   symptoms of mental illness, intentions to provide help to a friend who
   may be experiencing a mental health problem, and attitudes that promote
   problem recognition and help-seeking. There were no between-group
   differences in confidence to provide help, personal help-seeking
   intentions, and psychological distress. The results suggest that a brief
   intervention can be effective at improving the mental health literacy of
   young men when delivered within a sports context. Lay summary: Compared
   to a waitlist control, the Help Out a Mate group showed improvements in
   mental health literacy for depression and anxiety and intentions to
   provide help along with sustained improvements in attitudes that promote
   help-seeking and reduce stigma. Personal help-seeking intentions did not
   change as a result of the program.},

Abstract = {Despite the global presence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a paucity
   of treatment services exists in Tanzania and other low- and
   middle-income countries. The effect of delayed or low- quality
   treatments is enduring and contributes to lifelong variability in
   ASD-related functional impairments. Service disparities in Tanzania
   derive in part from a widespread lack of national ASD knowledge.
   Historically, in Western countries, parents have played a major role in
   increasing ASD awareness, advancing research, and encouraging
   empirically supported treatments. In the absence of established
   treatment services, parents of children with ASD have also learned to
   implement behavioral interventions to reduce the widening skills gaps.
   This article describes the development of an intervention designed to
   inform parents in Tanzania about ASD and empirically supported
   behavioral strategies. Preliminary data, collected from a clinical
   implementation with 29 Tanzanian families of children diagnosed with ASD
   or general developmental delays, support the initial feasibility and
   acceptability of this intervention. This brief intervention may help to
   ameliorate treatment disparities due to insufficient regional knowledge,
   language barriers, or limited service availability and may help improve
   functional outcomes among Tanzanian children with ASD.},

Title = {The Effects of Universal Educational Interventions in Improving Mental
   Health Literacy, Depression, and Anxiety Among Adolescents: A Systematic
   Review and Meta-Analysis},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH NURSING},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {34},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Adolescents are susceptible to developing depression and anxiety, and
   educational interventions could improve their mental well-being. This
   systematic review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of universal
   educational prevention interventions in improving mental health
   literacy, depression, and anxiety among adolescents. Eight electronic
   databases were searched until June 2024: Cochrane Library, PubMed,
   EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest
   Dissertations, and Theses Global. Since the included studies assessed
   various aspects of mental health literacy, the results for mental health
   literacy were synthesized narratively. In contrast, a meta-analysis
   using a random-effects model was applied to the depression and anxiety
   outcomes. Heterogeneity was examined using I2 statistics and Cochran's Q
   Chi-squared test. The Cochrane risk of bias tool and the GRADE approach
   conducted quality appraisal at the study and outcome levels,
   respectively. The review was reported according to the PRISMA
   guidelines. This review included 34 randomized controlled trials.
   Universal education prevention interventions were found to be promising
   in improving adolescents' mental health literacy but showed limited
   effects on individual mental health literacy components and on reducing
   depression (SMD = -0.06, 95\%CI: {[}-0.11, -0.02], Z = 2.58, p = 0.01,
   I2 = 45\%) and anxiety (SMD = -0.00, 95\%CI: {[}-0.06, 0.06], Z = 0.07,
   p = 0.94, I2 = 58\%) at post-intervention. Future trials should consider
   using a hybrid delivery model utilizing health care and the non-health
   care professionals. These interventions must incorporate skills-based
   sessions to develop emotional regulation strategies, complemented by
   extended follow-up periods that include booster sessions to reinforce
   learning. Given the very low quality of evidence as rated by the GRADE
   approach, current findings need to be interpreted with caution.},

Abstract = {BackgroundAdolescents are vulnerable to mental health problems, and this
   vulnerability may be enhanced in situations such as the present COVID-19
   pandemic. Online mental health literacy (MHL) education may help
   adolescents maintain/improve their mental health, especially in
   situations where face-to-face education is difficult.AimsTo evaluate the
   effects of a teacher-led ``online Short MHL Program (o-SMHLP){''}
   delivered online to grade 10 students in their
   classrooms.MethodsStudents (age 15-16) were randomly assigned to an
   o-SMHLP group (n = 115 (3 classes)) or a control group (n = 155 (4
   classes)) at the class level. The program consisted of a 20-minute
   session which included an animated video. The students completed a
   self-report questionnaire pre- and post-intervention assessing outcomes
   including: ``Knowledge about mental health/illnesses{''}, ``Recognition
   of necessity to seek help{''}, ``Intention to seek help{''}, and
   ``Unwillingness to socialize with people having mental illness{''}.
   Mixed effects modeling was employed for analyses.ResultsAll outcomes
   were significantly improved in the intervention group compared to the
   control group post-intervention, except for ``intention to seek
   help{''}.ConclusionsThe present study shows the effectiveness of an
   online MHL intervention while identifying the need for the development
   of effective online programs targeting adolescents' ``intention to seek
   help{''}.},

Title = {A Systematic Review of Parents' Mental Health Literacy Programs:
   Examining Program Effectiveness and Parent Satisfaction},
Journal = {CHILD PSYCHIATRY \& HUMAN DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 APR 12},
Abstract = {Current estimates suggest that nearly one in five youth in the United
   States have a clinically significant mental health problem. Many of
   these youth do not receive services, and if they do, they are often not
   evidence-based treatments. Parents are critical to the utilization of
   psychological services for youth; they are typically considered the
   gatekeepers to mental health services and frequently initiate
   help-seeking on behalf of their youth. Research has demonstrated that
   parents do not have sufficient knowledge and skills needed to handle
   youth mental health problems (i.e., mental health literacy), which
   likely contributes to the youth treatment disparity. To address this,
   the current systematic review explored global mental health literacy
   programs for parents to examine program effectiveness and parent
   satisfaction with programs. Nine programs were identified and described
   in terms of structure, content, and delivery method. Several programs
   demonstrated improvement in at least one component of parents' mental
   health literacy. Additionally, when assessed, parent satisfaction was
   generally positive, though areas for improvement were noted (e.g.,
   program content lacked specificity, need for more practical parenting
   skills). Overall, findings have meaningful implications for future
   research and program development.},

Abstract = {IntroductionLow levels of mental health literacy amongst parents can
   have negative effects on youth mental wellbeing and help-seeking
   behaviors. Here, we explored the impact of a brief psychoeducational
   workshop on improving parent mental health literacy and family
   relationships in Kibera, a low-resource high-risk setting in Nairobi,
   Kenya.MethodsThe workshop was designed to address this issue, and it was
   delivered by trained facilitators to small groups of parents (N = 72).
   Data was collected at baseline, post-workshop, two-week follow-up, and
   one-month follow-up.ResultsStatistical and thematic analysis of the data
   revealed significant improvements in parent mental health literacy
   scores and family relationships, indicating the acceptability and
   effectiveness of this workshop.DiscussionThe findings suggest that
   brief, group-based psychoeducational workshops can be effective in
   improving parent mental health literacy and family relationships,
   thereby addressing challenges faced by parents and youth in the Kenyan
   context. Future studies are needed to conclusively determine if such
   workshops can improve participants' own mental health or their

Journal = {BMC PSYCHIATRY},

Volume = {12},
Month = {MAR 22},
Abstract = {Background: With the burden of mental illness estimated to be costing
   the English economy alone around 22.5 pound billion a year {[}1],
   coupled with growing evidence that many mental disorders have their
   origins in adolescence, there is increasing pressure for schools to
   address the emotional well-being of their students, alongside the stigma
   and discrimination of mental illness. A number of prior educational
   interventions have been developed and evaluated for this purpose, but
   inconsistency of findings, reporting standards, and methodologies have
   led the majority of reviewers to conclude that the evidence for the
   efficacy of these programmes remains inconclusive.
   Methods/Design: A cluster randomised controlled trial design has been
   employed to enable a feasibility study of `SchoolSpace', an intervention
   in 7 UK secondary schools addressing stigma of mental illness, mental
   health literacy, and promotion of mental health. A central aspect of the
   intervention involves students in the experimental condition interacting
   with a young person with lived experience of mental illness, a stigma
   reducing technique designed to facilitate students' engagement in the
   project. The primary outcome is the level of stigma related to mental
   illness. Secondary outcomes include mental health literacy, resilience
   to mental illness, and emotional wellbeing. Outcomes will be measured
   pre and post intervention, as well as at 6 month follow-up.
   Discussion: The proposed intervention presents the potential for
   increased engagement due to its combination of education and contact
   with a young person with lived experience of mental illness. Contact as
   a technique to reduce discrimination has been evaluated previously in
   research with adults, but has been employed in only a minority of
   research trials investigating the impact on youth. Prior to this study,
   the effect of contact on mental health literacy, resilience, and
   emotional well-being has not been evaluated to the authors' knowledge.
   If efficacious the intervention could provide a reliable and
   cost-effective method to reduce stigma in young people, whilst
   increasing mental health literacy, and emotional well-being.

Title = {Cultural adaptation of youth mental health first aid training for Asian
   American parents},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {110},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Although often portrayed as ``model minorities,{''} many Asian American
   adolescents struggle with mental health problems. Asian American youth
   are also less likely to receive school-based mental health services
   (SBMHS) compared with their non-Asian peers. Culturally adapting the
   Youth Mental Health Fist Aid (YMHFA) training program can be an
   effective way to engage Asian American parents to utilize SBMHS.
   Although many school districts have offered YMHFA trainings to staff and
   parents, no controlled studies have evaluated the efficacy of YMHFA in
   the United States. We culturally adapted YMHFA for Asian American
   parents through collaboration with schools and community organizations,
   and evaluated its efficacy using a blocked random assignment study
   design. We examined if (a) YMHFA impacted parents' mental health
   literacy (MHL), help-seeking intentions, stigma, attitudes towards
   professional help, confidence in MHFA skills, engagement in first-aid
   behaviors, and youth mental health (both parent and youth report); and
   (b) whether the improvement was maintained four months after the
   training. Parents (n = 99, Mage = 46.24; SDage = 6.80, 89 \% mothers)
   were randomly assigned to treatment and waitlist control groups. They
   completed measures before the intervention, one month after the
   intervention, and four months after the intervention. Parents in the
   experimental group showed decreased stigma, and improvements in MHL,
   attitudes towards help seeking, confidence in using first aid behavior,
   and actual engagement in first aid behavior after attending the training
   as compared to parents in the waitlist control group. Participants in
   waitlist control group also showed improvements in all above-mentioned
   areas after receiving the training. All treatment gains were maintained
   at 4-month follow-up. Findings contributed to the limited literature on
   how to culturally adapt YMHFA for Asian American parents at school, and
   provided evidence for the efficacy of YMHFA among Asian American
   parents.},

Abstract = {BackgroundThe Improving Mental Health Literacy Among Children and Young
   People in Indonesia (IMPeTUs) intervention is a co-produced,
   evidence-based digital intervention designed to improve anxiety and
   depression focused mental health literacy and self-management among
   people aged 11-15 in Java, Indonesia. This study aimed to evaluate the
   usability, feasibility and preliminary impact of our
   intervention.MethodsMixed methods, multi-site case studies based on a
   theory of change. Pre-and post-assessments of a range of outcomes and
   qualitative interviews/focus groups with children and young people
   (CYP), parents and facilitators. The intervention was implemented in 8
   health, school and community sites across Java, Indonesia (Megelang,
   Jakarta and Bogor).Quantitative data designed to understand the impact
   of and feasibility of evaluating the intervention collected from 78 CYP
   who used the intervention were analysed descriptively. Qualitative data
   from interviews and focus groups collected from 56 CYP, 49
   parents/caregivers and 18 facilitators were analysed using framework
   analysis.ResultsQualitative data analysis indicated high levels of
   usability and acceptability for the interface aesthetic,
   personalisation, message presentation and navigation. Participants
   reported minimal burden and no negative outcomes associated with the
   intervention. CYP, parents and facilitators identified a range of direct
   and spill over effects of interventions engagement, some of which were
   not anticipated at study outset. Quantitative data highlighted the
   feasibility of intervention evaluation, with high levels of recruitment
   and retention across study time points. Minimal changes were identified
   in outcomes pre-to-post intervention, which may in part be due to a lack
   of scale relevance and/or sensitivity to the intervention mechanisms
   indicated in the qualitative data.ConclusionsDigital mental health
   literacy applications are potentially an acceptable and feasible way to
   prevent burdens of common mental health problems amongst CYP in
   Indonesia. Our intervention and evaluative processes will be further
   refined prior to definitive evaluation.},

Title = {Hope therapy brings hope: an empirical study of a curriculum
   intervention to enhance school adaptation of Chinese high school
   freshmen},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {16},
Month = {APR 28},
Abstract = {Adolescents often face significant school adaptation challenges during
   the school transition period, which may negatively affect their academic
   performance, emotional well-being, and long-term development. However,
   research on school adaptation interventions remains limited, especially
   in applying hope therapy within large-scale, curriculum-based models in
   the Chinese high school context. This study examined the empirical
   effects of an 8-week mental health intervention curriculum based on hope
   therapy in enhancing school adaptation with Chinese freshmen high school
   students. A pretest revealed that the natural stabilization time for
   freshmen school adaptation was the ninth week after enrollment. A
   subsequent formal intervention experiment used a pre- and post-test
   randomized group control design to divide 444 students into matched
   experimental and control groups. The experimental group participated in
   eight psychological intervention sessions based on hope therapy, and the
   control group received regular mental health lessons. Results showed
   that the experimental group's hope level and school adaptation
   significantly increased after the intervention, not only exceeding those
   of the pre-intervention level, but also significantly higher than those
   of the control group. Cross-lagged modeling results further revealed
   that hope levels at earlier time points significantly predicted
   subsequent school adaptation, while the reverse effect was not
   significant. These results collectively support the validity and
   applicability of hope therapy in improving adolescents' school
   adaptation, and provides innovative and alternative intervention
   perspectives and practice guidelines for high school mental health
   education, with a strong focus on raising youths' hope to develop
   meaningful lives.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Suicide is a leading cause of death among U.S. youth aged 12-18
   years. Youth Aware of Mental Health (YAM), a promising, universal,
   school-based mental health promotion/suicide primary prevention
   intervention for adolescents, has been evaluated in Europe but not in
   the U.S. The present study used an uncontrolled, pretest/post-test
   design to document the potential for YAM to reduce suicidal ideation,
   attempt, and suicide. A demonstration that help seeking behaviors,
   mental health literacy, and mental health stigmatizing attitudes improve
   after the intervention would suggest that the program is promising in
   the U.S., as well as in Europe, and that further investigation is
   merited.
   Methods: YAM was delivered to 1,878 students in 11 schools as part of
   regular school curricula. A subset of these students (n = 436) completed
   surveys before and 3 months postdelivery. Surveys included five
   questions about help seeking behaviors, a measure of intent to seek help
   (General Help Seeking Questionnaire), two mental health literacy scales,
   and two mental illness stigma scales (Reported and Intended Behavior
   Scale and Personal Stigma and Social Distance Scale). Both McNemar's
   test and repeated measures linear models were used to determine whether
   the survey outcomes changed after YAM delivery.
   Results: Among the 436 adolescents (286 and 150 in Montana and Texas,
   respectively), significant increases were found pre- to
   post-intervention in three of five help seeking behaviors, along with
   improved mental health literacy and decreased mental health-related
   stigma. Intent to seek help was unchanged.
   Conclusions: Several help seeking behavioral factors, mental health
   knowledge, and stigma improved post-YAM intervention. All three domains
   are likely protective against suicide. A randomized controlled trial
   testing the efficacy of YAM in preventing suicidal behaviors is

Abstract = {Mental health literacy (MHL) encompasses understanding mental health and
   learning how to obtain and maintain good mental health. Increasing MHL
   may increase help-seeking behaviors and positive mental health. This
   study aimed to identify school-based MHL interventions for
   children/youth using a scoping review methodology following the Johanna
   Briggs Model. The interventions were assessed for quality of evidence
   using the National Institutes of Health Study Quality Assessment Tools.
   Six databases were searched: Scopus, APA PsycInfo, Cochrane Library,
   ERIC, PubMed, and ProQuest Psychology. Search terms included ``mental
   health literacy,{''} ``intervention,{''} and ``children.{''} The search
   yielded 27 studies after applying inclusion criteria. Eight of these
   studies were assessed as ``poor{''} quality, twelve as ``fair{''}
   quality, and seven as ``good{''} quality. The results highlight the need
   for more research to implement and evaluate interventions to sustainably
   and feasibly incorporate school-based MHL interventions for children and
   youth into practice. Impact Statement Mental health literacy
   interventions are needed to improve knowledge of mental health, promote
   help-seeking for mental illness, and reduce stigma and negative
   attitudes toward mental illness. This review identifies that more good
   quality research is required of school-based mental health literacy
   interventions. New research is urgently needed to evaluate the
   feasibility and sustainability of interventions that reduce the
   prevalence of mental illness for children and youth. Supplemental data

Abstract = {With rapid development and modernization of today's society, the
   resource inequality between rural and urban areas has enlarged,
   especially regarding adolescents' mental health education. In order to
   provide alternative to adolescents with limited resources, this study
   targets test anxiety as example, aiming to explore the effectiveness of
   online mindfulness training in alleviating students' test anxiety
   through a quasi-experiment. This study recruited youths from 12 to 18
   years old and used their pre-test/post-test data on 186 trained
   participants (Mage = 14.85, 57.5\% male) and 217 propensity-score
   matched controls (Mage = 15.35, 53\% male). After careful analysis, the
   results proved the effectiveness of online mindfulness training in
   reducing test anxiety and showed that the online training was more
   beneficial for students with serious interpersonal problems. This study
   further provided implications for the use of technology in mental health
   education, promoting the care of psychological well-being in rural
   areas.},

   Systematic Review and Meta-analysis},
Journal = {SAGE OPEN},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {To address the urgent need for effective adolescent mental health
   support, this systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the impact
   of mental health literacy interventions on adolescents, a group highly
   susceptible to mental health issues. In accordance with the Preferred
   Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
   guidelines and registered under the International Platform of Registered
   Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (INPLASY202330098), our
   research thoroughly searched prominent databases, including PubMed, Web
   of Science, EBSCO, CNKI, Wanfang, and Chongqing VIP. We focused on
   studies employing a pre-test-post-test design to compare mental health
   literacy interventions against control groups. Our analysis included 18
   studies revealing statistically significant improvements in adolescents'
   mental health literacy, knowledge, and help-seeking and a reduction in
   stigma associated with mental health issues. The effectiveness of these
   interventions varied significantly across regions, with notable
   improvements in Asia, particularly in terms of help-seeking and stigma
   reduction. Interventions featuring frequent interactions proved
   particularly effective, showing significant increases in mental health
   knowledge and help-seeking. Multifaceted interventions that combined
   various methods were most beneficial for enhancing mental health
   knowledge. Importantly, although the positive effects on mental health
   literacy and stigma reduction were sustained at the 2-month follow-up,
   the improvements in help-seeking did not maintain significant levels
   post-intervention. These findings emphasize the critical need for
   tailored mental health literacy programs for adolescents and provide
   novel insights into the efficacy of interactive and diverse intervention
   strategies.},

Abstract = {Background: Although evidence-based depression prevention programs are
   available, Latino adolescents continue to underutilize and delay mental
   health intervention, resulting in increased rates of depression and
   suicide.
   Objectives: To describe a community-academic collaboration, program
   development and training of opinion leaders, preliminary findings, and
   lessons learned in conducting community-based participatory research
   (CBPR).
   Methods: A pilot study examined the feasibility, acceptability and
   perceived impact on community opinion leaders (n = 5) of a depression
   literacy and outreach training tailored to a low-income, urban, Latino
   population.
   Results: Results demonstrate feasibility, acceptability, and desirable
   changes in knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors among trained opinion
   leaders. Challenges related to research agenda, terminology, competency
   evaluation of participants, and referrals to treatment are presented,
   along with attempted solutions.
   Conclusions: Depression literacy and outreach training of key members of
   social networks for Latino adolescents shows promise as a culturally
   relevant and effective approach to depression/suicide prevention for
   Latino adolescents.},

Title = {Evaluation of MyTeen - a SMS-based mobile intervention for parents of
   adolescents: a randomised controlled trial protocol},
Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Month = {OCT 26},
Abstract = {Background: Parents play an important role in the lives of adolescents
   and efforts aimed at strengthening parenting skills and increasing
   knowledge on adolescent development hold much promise to prevent and
   mitigate adolescent mental health problems. Innovative interventions
   that make use of technology-based platforms might be an effective and
   efficient way to deliver such support to parents. This protocol presents
   the design of a randomised controlled trial to investigate the
   effectiveness of a SMS-based mobile intervention (MyTeen) for parents of
   adolescents on promoting parental competence and mental health literacy.
   Methods: A parallel two-arm randomised controlled trial will be
   conducted in New Zealand, aiming to recruit 214 parents or primary
   caregivers of adolescents aged 10-15 years via community outreach and
   social media. Eligible participants will be allocated 1:1 into the
   control or the intervention group, stratified by ethnicity. The
   intervention group will receive a tailored programme of text messages
   aimed at improving their parental competence and mental health literacy,
   over 4 weeks. The control group (care-as-usual) will receive no
   intervention from the research team, but can access alternative services
   if they wish, and will be offered the intervention programme upon
   completion of a 3-month post-randomisation follow-up assessment. Data
   will be obtained at baseline, post intervention (1-month), and 3-month
   follow up. The primary outcome is parental competence assessed by the
   Parental Sense of Competence Scale at 1-month follow up. Secondary
   outcomes include: mental health literacy; knowledge of help-seeking;
   parental distress; parent-adolescent communication; and programme
   satisfaction.
   Discussion: To our knowledge this is the first randomised controlled
   trial on the effectiveness of delivering a parenting support
   intervention for parents of adolescents solely via a SMS-based mobile
   intervention. If effective, it could have great potential to reach and
   support parents of adolescents.},

Title = {Mediating effect of psychological capital on the relationship between

Abstract = {BackgroundNewly recruited nurses face multiple sources of stress and
   their coping styles need to be focused on to ensure good mental health.
   This study aimed to examine the relationship among mental health
   literacy, psychological capital and coping styles in newly recruited
   nurses.MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted in August and
   September 2022. A total of 315 newly recruited nurses were recruited in
   a tertiary hospital in Henan Province, central China, employing the
   convenience sampling method. The self-reported questionnaires were sent
   through a QR code, including the Mental Health Literacy Scale for
   Healthcare Students, Psychological Capital Questionnaire, and Simplified
   Coping Style Questionnaire. Pearson correlation analysis was used to
   evaluate the relationships among the variables. Mediation analysis was
   performed to identify the mediating effect of psychological capital on
   the relationship between mental health literacy and coping
   styles.ResultsPositive coping showed a positive relationship with
   psychological capital and mental health literacy, while negative coping
   showed a negative relationship with psychological capital and mental
   health literacy. For positive coping, psychological capital was a
   partial mediator with an effect of 0.140, accounting for 62.8\%. For
   negative coping, a full mediating effect was shown by psychological
   capital between mental health literacy and negative coping, with an
   indirect effect of -0.048.ConclusionPsychological capital plays a
   partial and complete mediating role between mental health literacy and
   different coping styles among newly recruited nurses. Diversified
   training and personalized guidance in improving mental health literacy
   and increasing psychological capital simultaneously can be provided to
   newly recruited nurses continuously to adjust their coping styles.},

Abstract = {We aimed to clarify the public's mental health literacy of autism
   spectrum disorders (ASD).
   Using a vignette of a young child, 500 Japanese participants were asked
   their perspectives, such as causes and appropriate coping strategies.
   For each response from those respondents who correctly identified the
   child as having autism, we tested the effects of sex and generation.
   Two hundred twenty-nine respondents (45.8\%) correctly identified the
   child as having autism. Significantly (P < 0.05) more females planned
   practical coping strategies such as contacting public agencies, whereas
   males had relatively more irrelevant perceptions, for example,
   significantly more males attributed ASD to social environment.
   Significantly more young respondents expected psychiatric treatments
   such as antipsychotic administration to be effective, and more seniors
   estimated low that the prevalence is approximately 0.01\% or less.
   The mental health literacy of ASD among the Japanese public appears to
   be acceptable but there is still much room for improvement. Females
   showed more accurate knowledge, possibly reflecting gender roles. Some
   young people are not likely to know of the impact of psychiatric
   treatment, and seniors appear to be unaware of the current broadened
   recognition of ASD. Continued efforts to disseminate accurate
   information are required, particularly among males.},

Abstract = {The onset of many lifelong mental illnesses is during childhood and
   adolescence. There has been an increase in these conditions among
   children and adolescents especially, during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is
   essential to promote mental health literacy (MHL) as a preven-tive and
   universal intervention for children and adolescents. Positive mental
   health status in adolescence is related to an increased level of MHL,
   and various MHL programs at schools have been reported to be effective
   for adolescent students worldwide. Recently, MHL programs have been
   developed in South Korea to be used by schoolteachers. There is a need
   for active dissemination and development of future programs. For
   continuous and effective education, it is desirable to include MHL
   education in regular school curricula.},

Title = {Impact of contact on adolescents' mental health literacy and stigma: the
   SchoolSpace cluster randomised controlled trial},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Objectives: To investigate whether intergroup contact in addition to
   education is more effective than education alone in reducing stigma of
   mental illness in adolescents.
   Design: A pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial compared
   education alone with education plus contact. Blocking was used to
   randomly stratify classes within schools to condition. Random allocation
   was concealed, generated by a computer algorithm, and undertaken after
   pretest. Data was collected at pretest and 2-week follow-up. Analyses
   use an intention-to-treat basis.
   Setting: Secondary schools in Birmingham, UK.
   Participants: The parents and guardians of all students in year 8 (age
   12-13 years) were approached to take part.
   Interventions: A 1-day educational programme in each school led by
   mental health professional staff. Students in the `contact' condition
   received an interactive session with a young person with lived
   experience of mental illness.
   Outcomes: The primary outcome was students' attitudinal stigma of mental
   illness. Secondary outcomes included knowledge-based stigma, mental
   health literacy, emotional well-being and resilience, and help-seeking
   attitudes.
   Results: Participants were recruited between 1 May 2011 and 30 April
   2012. 769 participants completed the pretest and were randomised to
   condition. 657 (85\%) provided follow-up data. At 2-week follow-up,
   attitudinal stigma improved in both conditions with no significant
   effect of condition (95\% CI -0.40 to 0.22, p=0.5, d=0.01). Significant
   improvements were found in the education-alone condition compared with
   the contact and education condition for the secondary outcomes of
   knowledge-based stigma, mental health literacy, emotional well-being and
   resilience, and help-seeking attitudes.
   Conclusions: Contact was found to reduce the impact of the intervention
   for a number of outcomes. Caution is advised before employing intergroup
   contact with younger student age groups. The education intervention
   appeared to be successful in reducing stigma, promoting mental health
   knowledge, and increasing mental health literacy, as well as improving
   emotional well-being and resilience. A larger trial is needed to confirm
   these results.},

Abstract = {Mental health difficulties affect children and adolescents pervasively.
   School counsellors serve as frontliners to support the students in need,
   but often face challenges from the complexity of their cases. This study
   aims to develop a training module named MDAS (Mental Health disorder,
   Developmental disorders, Attachment and Self-compassionate) program to
   improve the school counsellors' mental health knowledge and counselling
   self-efficacy. The Module was adapted from Child and Adolescent Mental
   Health Training Module for Specialist 2009 (Second Edition). The study
   adopted a one group pre-test/post-test design to assess 28 school
   counsellors at 0-month and 4-month after the training. The scales used
   were Counselling Self-Efficacy scale (COSE), Mental Health Literacy
   Scale (MHLS) and Self-Compassionate Scale - Short Form (SCS-SF).
   Post-training, there were significant increment of COSE and MHLS scores
   (p < .001 and p < .046) with Cohen's d of 1.01 and 0.58. Four of the
   COSE subscales (micro skills, counselling process, cultural competence
   and dealing with difficult clients' behaviour) significantly increased
   after MDAS training (p < .001, p = .006, p = .001 and p = .01). In
   addition to increasing the counselling capacity of school counsellors,
   our training module can serve as a promising platform for mental health
   professionals and counsellors.},

Volume = {19},

Abstract = {Despite high rates of mental health challenges, Asian Americans are less
   likely to seek out and receive school-based mental health services
   (SBMHSs) than their non-Asian peers. The Youth Mental Health First Aid
   (YMHFA) training is an 8-hr manualized public education program designed
   to educate adults on recognizing common mental health challenges among
   adolescents and intervening. However, no published research has
   evaluated YMHFA among Asian Americans. We culturally adapted YMHFA for
   Asian Americans (Asian American parents and youth workers) and used a
   pretest/posttest design to evaluate its effectiveness. Specifically, we
   (a) added one 2-hr session before the YMHFA to augment engagement with
   the curriculum and (b) contextualized the YMHFA curriculum content to
   ensure cultural sensitivity for Asian American participants. Thirty-one
   Asian immigrant parents (M (age) = 45.55, SD = 3.6) and 24 Asian
   American youth workers (M (age) = 23.17, SD = 3.67) participated in
   YMHFA. Participants' mental health literacy (MHL) and their confidence
   in using MHFA skills significantly increased after the training.
   Participants also participated in four focus groups after the training
   to share their experiences. Participants stated that they benefited from
   this training and suggested additional cultural adaptations to make the
   program more appropriate for Asian Americans. Culturally adapted YMHFA
   may be an effective way to promote MHL and engage Asian Americans in
   mental health services.
   Impact Statement Asian American parents' and youth workers' MHL and
   confidence in using MHFA skills increased after attending YMHFA. Asian
   Americans perceived culturally adapted YMHFA training to be helpful.
   Culturally adapted YMHFA could help to engage Asian Americans in SBMHS.},

Abstract = {Background: Mental health literacy is an important predictor of
   appropriate help-seeking behaviour. Aims: This study investigated (a)
   the effects of an educational intervention on schizophrenia mental
   health literacy, beliefs about causes, discrimination, treatment, and
   attitudes that promote recognition, and (b) whether schizophrenia
   literacy would be higher in people with prior education in a
   health-related area than people without such education. Method: A
   randomised control design tested the effects of an educational
   intervention on schizophrenia literacy relative to a control group.
   Participants (N = 260; mean age = 31.18 years, SD = 11.43, female =
   78.8\%) answered a mental health literacy questionnaire, based on a
   vignette of a person with schizophrenia, before and after watching
   either an educational video on schizophrenia or a control video.
   Results: The intervention significantly increased schizophrenia
   identification and literacy, reduced personal stigma, and increased
   perceived discrimination in society. The health background group
   reported significantly greater schizophrenia identification than the no
   health background group. Participants thought help should be sought from
   health care professionals and through psychotherapy, close friends and
   physical activity. Conclusions: Targeted education can significantly
   improve the ability to identify schizophrenia which may have positive
   implications for reducing the time individuals take to seek help.},

   years) and a control group (526 children, 279 boys, M = 11.38 years, SD
   = 0.980 years). Over 16 weeks, the intervention group received a mental
   health education program, while the control group did not. The levels of
   life satisfaction (including five dimensions: family, school,
   environmental, friends, and self-satisfaction) and self-confidence
   (including three dimensions: self-efficacy, self-assurance, and
   self-competence) were rated by all children at baseline and
   post-intervention. Results from paired samples t-test showed that
   post-intervention, the intervention group exhibited significant
   improvements in the areas of family, environmental, school, and
   self-satisfaction as well as self-efficacy, self-assurance, and
   self-competence. However, there was no significant improvement in friend
   satisfaction. Conversely, the control group showed decreases in school,
   environmental, and friend satisfaction, along with decreases in
   self-efficacy, self-assurance, and self-competence. No significant
   change was observed in family and self-satisfaction in this group. These
   findings emphasize the importance of implementing mental health
   education interventions for rural children, who are at risk for low life
   satisfaction and self-confidence. Some specific recommendations are
   provided for policymakers and practitioners.},

Title = {A Game-Based School Program for Mental Health Literacy and Stigma
   Regarding Depression (Moving Stories): Protocol for a Randomized
   Controlled Trial},
Journal = {JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background: The prevalence of elevated depressive symptoms among youth
   in most western societies is high. Yet, most adolescents who are
   experiencing depressive symptoms do not seek help. Low mental health
   literacy, high stigma, and low social support have been shown to hinder
   help-seeking. A small number of interventions has been developed to
   target mental health literacy and stigma, but few focus on actual
   help-seeking and first aid behavior. We have developed a game-based
   school program called Moving Stories that targets mental health
   literacy, including knowledge and behavior, and stigma among
   adolescents, in regard to depression specifically.
   Objective: Our aim is to describe the protocol for a study that will
   test the effectiveness of the program Moving Stories in a Dutch
   adolescent sample. We hypothesize that adolescents who participate in
   the program Moving Stories will have better mental health literacy and
   less stigma regarding depression compared to adolescents in the
   nonintervention control group at posttest and at 3- and 6-months
   follow-up. We also expect a positive change in actual help-seeking and
   first aid behavior at 3- and 6-months follow-up.
   Methods: Moving Stories has been developed by a professional game design
   company in collaboration with researchers and relevant stakeholders. The
   effectiveness of Moving Stories will be tested through a randomized
   controlled trial with two conditions: Moving Stories versus control.
   Participants will fill in questionnaires at pretest, posttest, and 3-
   and 6-months follow-up. Our power analysis showed a required sample size
   of 180 adolescents.
   Results: Four high schools have agreed to participate with a total of 10
   classes. A total of 185 adolescents filled in the pretest questionnaire.
   The last of the follow-up data was collected in December 2018.
   Conclusions: If Moving Stories proves to be effective, it could be
   implemented as a school-based program to target mental health literacy
   and stigma regarding depression; this could, in turn, improve early
   help-seeking in adolescents suffering from depression.},

Title = {Becoming peer educators in workplace mental health: Qualitative

Journal = {WORK-A JOURNAL OF PREVENTION ASSESSMENT \& REHABILITATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {72},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Peer-led workplace mental health training programs informed
   by the principles of contact-based education have shown promising
   results, but research evidence largely focuses on measuring outcomes for
   service recipients with little attention to the experiences of peer
   educators in delivering these interventions.
   OBJECTIVE: To gain in-depth knowledge about the opportunities and
   challenges experienced peer educators recruited to lead a mental health
   literacy training program for healthcare workers.
   METHODS: An interpretive description approach was used to explore the
   experiences of peer educators in providing a structured two-day ``Beyond
   Silence{''} workplace mental health training program. Peer educators
   were healthcare workers with personal mental health experience, who
   completed an additional leadership training. Semi-structured telephone
   interviews were conducted with seven peer educators. Data collection and
   analysis was concurrent and iterative, employing inductive analysis.
   RESULTS: Four overarching themes captured the key opportunities and
   challenges faced by peer educators: 1) the art and science of providing
   mental health literacy training, 2) power of personal stories, 3)
   competence as a journey or a destination and 4) the dual role of
   educator and advocate.
   CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations are provided for recruitment, training, and
   support for peer educators. Future research could focus on longitudinal
   evaluation of engagement and sustainability of peer educators in this
   role.},

Abstract = {Higher vocational education has a key role in the cultivation of new
   talents and the development of the country through science and
   education. Psychological education differs from other fields of higher
   learning because different methods and models of mental health education
   are employed according to their characteristics. The psychological
   health education in higher vocational colleges under the intervention of
   the rational emotional model was studied in this paper. After
   introducing the present situation of psychological education in higher
   vocational colleges at home and abroad as well as the related theories
   and technologies, the mental state of vocational students and the
   educational characteristics of colleges and universities were used to
   explore the psychological education mode of these institutions. Several
   methods for emotional guidance were devised, and a series of
   interventions for mental health education in higher vocational colleges
   was proposed. The mental health status of vocational students before and
   after the implementation of the rational emotional intervention was
   tested and analyzed. The experimental results reveal that the rational
   emotional model positively affects mental health education in higher
   vocational colleges and that the rational emotional intervention
   significantly improves the psychological status of students.},

Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},

Month = {OCT 18},
Abstract = {Background Emotional disorders in young people are increasing but
   studies have found that this age group do not always recognise the signs
   and symptoms of mental health problems in themselves or others. The
   Mental Health Foundation's school-based Peer Education Project (PEP) has
   the potential to improve young people's understanding of their own
   mental health at a critical developmental stage (early adolescence)
   using a peer teaching method. This study is a process evaluation to
   understand: the mechanisms through which PEP might improve young
   people's mental health literacy, any challenges with delivery, how the
   project can be embedded within wider school life and how it can be
   improved to be of most benefit to the widest number of young people. We
   will also validate a bespoke mental health literacy questionnaire, and
   test the feasibility of using it to measure outcomes in preparation for
   a future study evaluating effectiveness. Methods All schools recruited
   to the study will receive the PEP intervention. The process evaluation
   will be informed by realist evaluation approaches to build understanding
   regarding key mechanisms of change and the impact of different school
   contexts. The evaluation will test and revise an existing intervention
   logic model which has been developed in partnership with the Mental
   Health Foundation. Process evaluation data will be collected from newly
   recruited schools (n = 4) as well as current PEP user schools (n = 2)
   including training and lesson delivery observations, staff interviews
   and student focus groups. Baseline and follow-up data will be collected
   in all newly recruited intervention schools (n = 4) from all students in
   Year 7/8 (who receive the PEP) and recruited peer educators in Year 12
   via a self-report survey. Discussion This study will enable us to refine
   the logic model underpinning the peer education project and identify
   areas of the intervention that can be improved. Findings will also
   inform the design of a future effectiveness study which will test out
   the extent to which PEP improves mental health literacy.},

Abstract = {This article engages matauranga Maori, social psychology and the
   sociology of education to argue that an individualistic approach to
   mental health education in schools is inadequate. In this article we
   discuss a recent national school curriculum policy that demonstrates the
   ways mental health education can be framed by Te Tiriti o Waitangi,
   informed by the determinants of health, and culturally located in
   worldviews representative of Te Ao Maori. This framework encourages
   schools take a `whole of school' approach to mental health education,
   embedded in teacher development, curriculum learning, and community
   engagement. We argue that this approach - aligned with the three
   articles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi - necessarily involves schools
   consulting with diverse akonga (learners) and communities, involving
   them in mental health curriculum development, implementation, and
   evaluation. When conducted in culturally and socially conscious ways,
   the relationship between boards, schools and the wider school community
   can embody effective governance (article one), honour hapu, iwi and
   Maori rangatiratanga (article two) and encourage equal participation and
   inclusion for equitable mental health education and outcomes (article
   three). We argue that this approach to mental health is Te Tiriti-led,
   relational, and more likely to be well-being enhancing for diverse young
   people and communities.},

Title = {teen Mental Health First Aid: 12-month outcomes from a cluster crossover
   randomized controlled trial evaluation of a universal program to help
   adolescents better support peers with a mental health problem},
Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},

Month = {JUN 10},
Abstract = {Background: teen Mental Health First Aid (tMHFA) is a universal mental
   health literacy, stigma reduction, helpseeking, and suicide prevention
   program designed for adolescents in Years 10-12 of secondary school
   (16-18 years). tMHFA is delivered by trained instructors, in a regular
   classroom setting, to increase the knowledge, attitudes and behaviours
   that adolescents' require to better support peers with mental health
   problems or mental health crises.
   Methods: To explore the efficacy of tMHFA, a cluster crossover
   randomised controlled trial was conducted with Year 10 students in four
   schools in Victoria, Australia, using physical first aid training as the
   control intervention. Of the 1942 eligible students, 1,624 completed
   baseline and 894 completed follow-up surveys. Online surveys,
   administered one week before training and again 12-months later,
   included vignettes depicting peers John (depression and suicide risk)
   and Jeanie (social anxiety/phobia), measures of mental health first aid
   (quality of first aid intentions, confidence, first aid behaviours
   provided, and first aid behaviours received), mental health literacy
   (beliefs about adult help, help-seeking intentions), and stigma (social
   distance, weak-not-sick, dangerous/unpredictable, and would not tell
   anyone).
   Results: The primary outcome-quality of first aid intentions towards the
   John vignette-showed statistically significant group x time
   interactions, with tMHFA students reporting more helpful and less
   unhelpful first aid intentions, than PFA students did over time.
   Confidence in providing first aid also showed significant interactions.
   First aid behaviours-both those provided to a peer with a mental health
   problem and those received from a peer-showed null results. Ratings of
   both beliefs about adult help and help-seeking intentions were found to
   be significantly improved among tMHFA students at follow-up. A group x
   time interaction was found on one stigma scale (would not tell anyone).
   Conclusions: This trial showed that, one year after training, tMHFA
   improves first aid intentions towards peers with depression and suicide
   risk, confidence in helping peers with mental health problems,
   willingness to tell someone and seek help from an adult or health
   professional if experiencing a mental health problem.},

Title = {Developing and evaluating a peer-based mental health literacy
   intervention with adolescent athletes},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Widespread adolescent involvement in organized sport means that sport
   contexts are well-suited to `actively' integrate prevention programs
   that may promote population-level change. This mixed methods study aimed
   to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a peer-based mental
   health literacy intervention. The intervention (i.e., Team Talk) was
   presented to eleven adolescent sport teams in the United States, with a
   total of 174 participants. Athlete participants completed surveys
   immediately before and after the intervention-including measures of
   workshop acceptability, social identity, and help-seeking behaviors.
   Semi-structured interviews were also conducted with a subset of five
   athletes, nine parents, and two coaches. With respect to recruitment as
   an indicator of feasibility, club-level adoption of the intervention was
   low, with difficulty recruiting clubs for intervention delivery. This
   signals that feasibility of the intervention-as it is currently designed
   and implemented by the research team-is low when considering similar
   competitive adolescent sport clubs and delivered as team-level
   workshops. Meanwhile, participants reported high acceptability of the
   intervention, and acceptability levels across participants was predicted
   by contextual factors related to implementation such as session
   duration. Regarding limited efficacy testing with measures completed
   before and after the intervention session: (a) social identity scores
   increased following the intervention, and (b) significant differences
   were not identified regarding efficacy to recognize symptoms of mental
   disorders. Athlete, coach, and parent interview responses also described
   potential adaptations to mental health programs. This research
   demonstrates the potential utility of peer-based mental health literacy
   interventions, while also revealing that further implementation research
   is necessary to adapt mental health literacy interventions to suit
   diverse adolescent sport contexts.},

Title = {Improving the Capacity of Non-Physician Primary Care Providers to
   Address Child and Youth Mental Health Through Mental Health Literacy
   Approaches},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PRIMARY CARE AND COMMUNITY HEALTH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Abstract = {Introduction and Objectives: Canadians rely on their primary care
   providers to address their mental health needs, but there are
   longstanding system gaps that must be addressed to enhance their ability
   to deliver mental health care. The present study addressed the gap in
   pediatric mental health care through the development, delivery, and
   evaluation of a mental health literacy training among non-physician
   primary care providers. Methods: We delivered the training among 97
   participants, with all completed the pre-test survey, and 74 completed
   the post-test survey on knowledge, attitudes toward mental health, and
   help-seeking intentions. Additionally, participants explained why they
   attended the training and shared how they would apply the knowledge
   learned into their practice (behaviors). Results: Participants improved
   their knowledge significantly from pre-test to post-test, P < .001, d =
   2.51. We didn't find any statistical significance between pre-test and
   post-test on attitudes, P = .067, nor on help-seeking intentions, P =
   .274. However, participants' scores were exceedingly high on both
   outcomes, indicating positive attitudes and intentions at 2 time points
   and implying a ceiling effect of both outcomes. We did not find outcome
   differences by demographics, practice year, practice zone, or
   professional role. While knowledge, years of practice and prior mental
   health training predicted participants attitudes at pre-test, they
   didn't at post-test. Attitudes toward mental health predicted
   help-seeking intentions. Participants indicated this training will
   change their practice behaviors. Conclusion: This mental health literacy
   training for primary care providers demonstrated strong evidence of the
   need to integrate mental health and addiction support into primary care
   practice.},

Journal = {EARLY INTERVENTION IN PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {7},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Aim: Conduct a systematic review for the effectiveness of school mental
   health literacy programs to enhance knowledge, reduce stigmatizing
   attitudes and improve help-seeking behaviours among youth (1225 years of
   age). Methods: Reviewers independently searched PubMed, PsycINFO,
   Cochrane Library, CINAHL, ERIC, grey literature and reference lists of
   included studies. They reached a consensus on the included studies, and
   rated the risk of bias of each study. Studies that reported three
   outcomes: knowledge acquisition, stigmatizing attitudes and help-seeking
   behaviours; and were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cluster RCTs,
   quasi-experimental studies, and controlled-before-and-after studies,
   were eligible. Results: This review resulted in 27 articles including 5
   RCTs, 13 quasi-experimental studies, and 9 controlled-before-and-after
   studies. Whereas most included studies claimed school-based mental
   health literacy programs improve knowledge, attitudes and help-seeking
   behaviour, 17 studies met criteria for high risk of bias, 10 studies for
   moderate risk of bias, and no studies for low risk of bias. Common
   limitations included the lack of randomization, control for confounding
   factors, validated measures and report on attrition in most studies. The
   overall quality of the evidence for knowledge and help-seeking behaviour
   outcomes was very low, and low for the attitude outcome. Conclusions:
   Research into school-based mental health literacy is still in its
   infancy and there is insufficient evidence to claim for positive impact
   of school mental health literacy programs on knowledge improvement,
   attitudinal change or help-seeking behaviour. Future research should
   focus on methods to appropriately determine the evidence of
   effectiveness on school-based mental health literacy programs,
   considering the values of both RCTs and other research designs in this
   approach. Educators should consider the strengths and weaknesses of
   current mental health literacy programs to inform decisions regarding
   possible implementation.},

Abstract = {The mental health of adolescents is a topic of increasing importance in
   our society. Knowing the mental health literacy of this population may
   provide key information to improve prevention and intervention policies.
   This research analyses the psychometric properties of the MHLq-E Spanish
   version, a self-administered self-report questionnaire on mental health
   literacy, specific to the adolescent population. A descriptive
   cross-sectional study including a representative sample of Spanish
   adolescents aged 12-16 years (N = 1000) was conducted. Results reveal a
   four-factor structure: help-seeking; stigma; knowledge of causes;
   knowledge of symptomatology. The selected four-factor solution accounts
   for 35\% of the shared variance. High internal consistency, item
   reliability and good measures of validity were found. The global
   reliability of the questionnaire was alpha = 0.92 and omega t = 0.94.
   The reliability of the dimensions ranged from alpha = 0.79, omega t =
   0.79 for Stigma to alpha = 0.87, omega t = 0.87 for Help. Factor loads
   were significant and above 0.4 suggesting appropriate convergent
   validity, and evidence of discriminant validity was also adequate.
   Although it differs from the original instrument, the analysis is
   consistent with other research and highlights the multiple dimensions of
   mental health literacy. The MHLq-E is the first instrument available in
   Spanish to assess mental health literacy in adolescents in Spain.},

Title = {``I'm Not Alone{''}: Exploring Southeast Asian American High School
   Students' Experiences in a Mental Health Literacy Intervention},
Journal = {ASIAN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 JUL 10},
Abstract = {The mental health needs of Southeast Asian American high school students
   are often overlooked, despite the significant challenges they face,
   including intergenerational trauma, stigma, and limited access to mental
   health resources. The authors conducted a phenomenological study to
   explore the lived experiences of Southeast Asian American high school
   students who participated in a culturally tailored mental health
   literacy intervention. Seven students participated with six identified
   as Hmong American and one identified as Chinese Vietnamese American.
   Thematic data analysis was used to explore and code the data. Through
   semistructured interviews with seven participants, this study identified
   five key themes: (a) improved mental health knowledge, (b) openness to
   talk about mental health, (c) empathy and perspective-taking, (d)
   help-seeking and coping, and (e) community and connection. Findings
   revealed that the mental health literacy intervention fostered improved
   mental health knowledge, reduced stigma, and strengthened participants'
   confidence in seeking help for themselves and others. Additionally,
   participants reported a heightened sense of empathy and connection to

Abstract = {INTRODUCTION Nursing students in the United States and China have
   reported inadequate preparedness for practice in mental health nursing.
   It is important to investigate nursing students' mental health literacy
   levels for a better understanding of their practice readiness in mental
   health field upon completion of their education.
   Aim This study was aimed at developing an understanding of American and
   Chinese nursing students' mental health literacy regarding the
   effectiveness of specific interventions for managing depression and
   schizophrenia.
   Method The Australian National Mental Health Literacy Survey was
   completed by a group of 310 nursing students including 152 Americans and
   158 Chinese between April 2016 and April 2017 to compare students' rated
   intervention options on two provided vignettes.
   Results The two student groups reached consensus on many intervention
   options. However, the Chinese students showed more preference to
   occasional alcohol consumption and specialized therapies and the US
   students held less skepticism towards traditional practices as treatment
   options for depression and schizophrenia.
   Discussion and implications for practice The findings support
   professional and psychosocial interventions in caring for patients with
   mental disorders. There is a significant need for specific education on
   safe alcohol consumption guidelines for Chinese nursing students and
   clinical practice guidelines for managing mental disorders for American
   nursing students.},

Abstract = {Context: Lack of education, stigma, and negative self -attitudes are key
   barriers to help-seeking in Gaelic football-ers. With the prevalence of
   mental health issues in Gaelic footballers and the increased risk of
   experiencing mental health challenges after injury, mental health
   literacy (MHL) interventions are necessary. Objectives: To design and
   implement a novel MHL educa-tional intervention program in Gaelic
   footballers. Design: Controlled laboratory study. Setting: Online.
   Patients or Other Participants: Elite and subelite Gaelic footballers
   divided into intervention (n = 70; age = 25.1 +/- 4.5 years) and control
   (n = 75; age = 24.4 +/- 6.0 years) groups. In the intervention group, 85
   participants were recruited, but 15 dropped out after completing
   baseline measures. Interventions: A novel educational intervention
   program, ``GAA {[}Gaelic Athletic Association] and Mental Health-Injury
   and a Healthy Mind,{''} was designed to address the key compo-nents of
   MHL and was underpinned by the Theory of Planned Behavior and the
   Help-Seeking Model. The intervention was implemented online via a brief
   25-minute presentation. Main Outcome Measures: Measures of stigma,
   help-seeking attitudes, and MHL were completed by the intervention group
   at baseline, immediately after viewing the MHL program, and at 1 week
   and 1 month after the intervention. The control group completed the
   measures at similar time points. Results: Stigma decreased, and
   attitudes toward help -seeking and MHL increased in the intervention
   group from base-line to after the intervention (P , .05), with
   significant differences sustained at 1-week and 1-month follow-ups. Our
   results showed differences in stigma, attitudes, and MHL between groups
   across time points. Intervention participants provided positive
   feedback, and the program was appraised as informative. Conclusions:
   Remote online delivery of a novel MHL edu-cational program can
   effectively decrease mental health stigma, improve attitudes toward
   help-seeking, and increase the recogni-tion and knowledge of mental
   health issues. Gaelic footballers with improved MHL may be better
   equipped to manage their mental health and cope with stressors, leading
   to improved men-tal health outcomes and overall mental well-being.},

Abstract = {School-based mental health literacy (MHL) programs can increase
   knowledge, reduce stigma, and encourage help-seeking behaviors in
   school-aged children. Yet, MHL intervention effects are inconsistent and
   unsustainable over time, and scholars have called for more theoretical
   work to address these limitations. The purpose of this theoretical
   review is to investigate how theory is utilized in MHL interventions,
   explore the interpersonal communication processes integrated in MHL
   interventions, and uncover the theoretical assumptions made in MHL
   interventions about interpersonal communication. We identified 27
   articles for inclusion and utilized both content and interpretive
   analyses. Findings suggest that very few MHL interventions are based in
   theory; interpersonal communication is a central component within MHL
   programming; and numerous assumptions are made about interpersonal
   communication within MHL interventions that need to be addressed
   theoretically and empirically. Accordingly, we recommend that MHL
   intervention content and delivery practices are grounded in
   interpersonal communication theory related to disclosure and social
   support (seeking and provision). Additionally, teaching disclosure and
   social support skills may be a productive way for MHL interventions to
   help students build self-efficacy in communication about mental health
   for themselves and others.},

   regarding the mental health literacy of paramedics and student
   paramedics and whether mental health literacy affects the care that
   paramedics provide to their patients with mental illness.
   Design/methodology/approach Embase, PubMed, Medline and Google Scholar
   were searched for recent (2010-2020) English language published articles
   using the key phrases paramedic AND/OR ambulance AND mental health AND
   mental health literacy. Additional searches of the reference lists of
   included articles were undertaken. A descriptive thematic analysis was
   used to arrive at a narrative synthesis of the study findings. Findings
   The emergency medical services system has taken a primary role in the
   care of patients with mental illness but has limited capacity for
   non-emergency psychosocial situations. Negative and judgemental
   attitudes amongst paramedics towards patients with mental illness is a
   significant issue and remains a barrier to patients seeking medical care

Abstract = {Objective Mental illness is a common medical condition to onset during
   adolescence. Young people who leave for postsecondary life are at an
   especially challenging period of lifetime when many will leave home and
   familiar environments for prolonged periods of time. These new
   circumstances may put young people at risk of developing mental health
   problems or disorders or exacerbate existing mental disorders.
   Alternatively, some young people may misinterpret the normal negative
   emotional states occurring as a result of these new challenges as a
   mental disorder requiring professional intervention. We conducted a
   quasiexperimental cohort study to investigate the effectiveness of a
   mental health literacy intervention Transitions with blended life skills
   to address these challenges for first-year postsecondary students.
   Methods Students (n = 2,397) from five Canadian postsecondary
   institutions were assigned to the intervention or the control group and
   were administered a survey at baseline, postintervention, and at 2-month
   follow-up (September 2017 to February 2018). We applied generalized
   linear mixed effects (PROC Mixed procedure) to test the between-group
   difference in the post-pre/follow-up-pre and to determine the predicted
   least-square mean values. Results The findings showed that students who
   were exposed to the Transitions intervention significantly improved
   their mental health knowledge, decreased stigma against mental illness,
   improved help-seeking attitudes and behaviours, and decreased perceived
   stress when compared to students who had not been exposed to the
   intervention. However, we did not identify significant changes in
   general health. This may be due to the relatively short follow-up time
   (2 months) to determine participants' general health status. Conclusions
   Transitions delivered to first-year postsecondary students may be a
   beneficial intervention to help young people adjust to their new
   postsecondary life and improve their mental health.},

Abstract = {Background: From the age of 14, many adolescents enter a vulnerable
   developmental phase, with a sharp increase in mental illness at 16. The
   COVID19 pandemic has further exacerbated this issue. Hence, universal
   and easily accessible prevention in the young is needed. E-mental health
   interventions are on the rise due to numerous benefits such as potential
   low-costs, low-threshold and high scalability. However, effectiveness
   and acceptance of mobile health (mHealth) preventive interventions
   remain unresearched. Method: In a two-armed, randomised controlled study
   design adolescents and young adults from 14 years old will be recruited.
   Following an initial baseline assessment, they will be randomised to a)
   the intervention group (IG, n = 75), which will receive a mHealth
   intervention (the application `Mental Health Guide', co-developed by
   lived experience experts) or b) the waiting list control group (CG, n =
   75). Both groups will be followed up after 3 and 6 months following post
   assessment. We hypothesize an increase in mental health literacy in the
   IG compared to the CG for post and follow-up assessment (primary
   outcome: Mental Health Literacy Scale). In addition, we expect an
   improvement in mental health and psychological well-being, improved
   emotion regulation, reduced psychological distress, as well as good
   quality ratings in usability and acceptance in the use of the `Mental
   Health Guide' We performed multiple simulations of possible outcome
   scenarios, incorporating an array of factors, to generate realistic
   datasets and obtain accurate estimates of statistical power. Conclusion:
   As a first-of-its-kind in this field, this study investigates whether a
   mHealth intervention based on mental health literacy may improve the
   mental health literacy and further aspects of psychological functioning
   of young people in a vulnerable phase. Furthermore, the results promise
   to provide important knowledge of how universal prevention may be
   implemented with low costs for diverse populations. Trial registration:

Title = {Mental Health Literacy in Young Adults: Adaptation and Psychometric
   Properties of the Mental Health Literacy Questionnaire},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},

Abstract = {Mental health literacy (MHL) is considered a prerequisite for early
   recognition and intervention in mental disorders, and for this reason,
   it has become a focus of research over the past few decades. Assessing
   this construct is relevant for identifying knowledge gaps and erroneous
   beliefs concerning mental health issues, to inform the development of
   interventions aimed at promoting mental health literacy as well as the
   evaluation of these interventions. Recently, we developed a new
   self-reporting measure (MHLq) for assessing mental health literacy in
   young people (12-14 years-old), meeting the need to assess MHL from a
   comprehensive perspective of the construct instead of focusing on a
   restricted number of mental disorders or specific dimensions (e.g.,
   knowledge concerning specific disorders; stigma). The present study
   aimed to adapt the MHLq for the young adult population and to examine
   its psychometric properties, according to the following steps: (1) item
   adaptation, using a think aloud procedure (n = 5); (2) data collection
   (n = 356, aged between 18 and 25 years old; and (3) psychometric
   analyses (exploratory factor analysis and internal consistency
   analysis). The final version of the questionnaire included 29 items
   (total scale alpha = 0.84), organized by four dimensions: (1) knowledge
   of mental health problems (alpha = 0.74); (2) erroneous
   beliefs/stereotypes (alpha = 0.72); (3) help-seeking and first aid
   skills (alpha = 0.71); and (4) self-help strategies (alpha = 0.60). The
   results suggest that the MHLq-adult form is a practical, valid, and
   reliable screening tool for identifying gaps in knowledge, beliefs, and
   behavioral intentions related to mental health and mental disorders,
   planning promotion programs, and evaluating intervention effectiveness.},

   Examining Changes in Their Knowledge, Attitudes, and Behaviour},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE},

Abstract = {Background: This study evaluated the effectiveness of a comprehensive
   mental health literacy (MHL) educational programme known as ``Sanita{''}
   for improving junior high school students' knowledge of mental illness,
   attitudes towards people with mental health problems, and help-seeking
   behaviour. Methods: A randomised controlled trial with a parallel-group
   design was conducted. A total of 125 students (51 in the intervention
   group and 74 in the control group) received three 50-min classes and
   completed self-report questionnaires (Mental Illness and Disorder
   Understanding Scale, MIDUS; Reported and Intended Behaviour Scale,
   RIBS-J; and an original questionnaire investigating help-seeking
   behaviour) before and after the programme and three months later.
   Results: Regarding MIDUS, the post-test and 3-month follow-up test
   results showed a significant main effect of time-by-group interactions
   in a linear mixed model. Regarding RIBS-J, the post-test results showed
   a significant main effect of time-by-group interactions; however, the
   3-month follow-up test showed no significant effect. No significant
   effects of time-by-group interactions were seen in the post-test and
   3-month follow-up test results for help-seeking behaviour in a logistic
   regression-mixed model. Conclusions: The Sanita MHL educational
   programme was longitudinally effective at improving junior high school
   students' knowledge of mental illness, although improvements in
   attitudes and help-seeking behaviour were insufficient.},

Journal = {MENTAL HEALTH REVIEW JOURNAL},

Abstract = {Purpose - Adolescence and young adulthood are recognised as critical
   time for developing mental health literacy (MHL). The purpose of this
   study is to analyse the effectiveness of current MHL interventions to
   guide the future development of MHL intervention strategies.
   Design/methodology/approach - A meta-analysis adopting the PRISMA
   framework for systematically reviewing the literature was adopted. Three
   authors independently reviewed studies and extrapolated key data for
   analysis. A robust random-effects model with adjustments for small study
   biases was conducted to establish the effect sizes of all included MHL
   interventions. Moderator analysis was conducted to examine the effects
   of intervention length in MHL.
   Findings - A total of 11 intervention studies were identified and
   analysed, resulting in a medium to large pooled effect size of 0.62
   (95\% CI: 0.28; 0.96). Moderator analysis found that short interventions
   had an estimated standard mean difference (SMD) effect size of 0.9220
   (95\% CI: - 1.1555; 2.9995). This was greater than the medium length
   interventions, with an estimated SMD effect size of 0.4967 (95\% CI:
   0.0452; 0.9483), and long interventions, with an estimated SMD effect
   size of 0.5628 (95\% CI: - 0.2726; 1.3983). As a result, MHL
   interventions are proficient in improving young adults' MHL, with
   shorter interventions (45-50min) having the largest effect size. This
   study highlights several inconsistencies in methodological rigour and
   reporting from studies in this area, which future research should look
   to address.
   Originality/value - To date, MHL review studies have often focused their
   attention on a specific domain, most notably education and school-based
   setting. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no reviews have
   conducted a meta-analysis across contexts and domains with a specific
   focus on MHL intervention strategies for young adults.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveThe prevalence of mental health problems among youth is high,
   and help seeking behaviour is low. Mental health literacy (MHL) has been
   suggested as a factor to enhance mental health knowledge and increase
   help seeking and coping behaviours. Schools have been recognised as an
   ideal environment for MHL programs to be delivered to reach a wide range
   of youth. This study aimed to understand the perspectives and
   experiences of secondary school students after participating in a MHL
   program, and how findings aligned with the theoretical model the program
   is based on.MethodThirty-eight participants aged 12-16 years provided
   feedback through an open-ended questionnaire. The questionnaire
   comprised seven items to gather participants' experiences and
   perspectives on the MHL program, including usefulness, ideas for program
   improvement, impact, and coping strategies. This study was preregistered
   on the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, Registration
   Number: ACTRN12621000325808.ResultsReflexive thematic analysis generated
   three themes and three subthemes from the findings: 1) A safe
   environment, 2) Perceived positive impact, 2.1) Attitudes towards mental
   health, 2.2) Coping strategies, 2.3) Need for MHL, and 3) Suggestions
   for program improvement.ConclusionsThese findings indicate that the
   school-based program meets the current MHL needs of young people, aligns
   with the MHL Child Focused theoretical model, and was viewed as
   beneficial to be incorporated into the education system in future.},

Abstract = {This research is an evaluation of a six-week mental health literacy
   programme, referred to as the Cambridge United Community Trust's `Mind
   Your Head' programme, which was delivered by sports professionals to
   secondary school students (11-16) in Cambridge, England, during 2017-18.
   A Mental Health Literacy Scale was used to measure students' knowledge
   of mental health issues pre- and post-intervention. Statistical data
   from these surveys were analysed using an independent samples t-test.
   Focus groups were held with students in each school, and individual
   semi-structured interviews were conducted with one lead teacher in each
   school. The statistical data indicate that statistically significant
   improvements in mental health literacy were achieved, and this occurred
   across all genders and ethnicities. The qualitative data suggest that
   this programme resulted in positive attitudes towards mental health and
   improved knowledge of how to seek help. The data indicate that
   investment in similar programmes would be beneficial for schools in
   improving students' knowledge of mental health and reducing stigma.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Chinese international students have been widely reported to
   lack recognition of their psychological problems and to delay treatment
   until their symptoms become rather disabling. The present study
   pioneered to evaluate the effectiveness of Mental Health First Aid
   (MHFA) training in improving mental health knowledge among
   Chinese-speaking international tertiary students. Method: A
   quasi-experimental design was adopted, whereby 202 Chinese-speaking
   international students in Melbourne were assigned to the MHFA condition
   or a control condition. All participants completed a standardized
   questionnaire before, at the end, and 3 months after training. Data were
   analyzed using multilevel modeling. Results: The findings demonstrated
   that MHFA training might be effective in improving participants'
   knowledge of mental disorders (i.e., recognition of symptoms, belief in
   helpful treatments, and understanding the biogenetic and psychosocial
   causes) and reducing stigma. Conclusions: The MHFA program has the
   potential to enhance mental health knowledge and promote help-seeking
   among Chinese-speaking international students.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a school-based mental
   health education program in preventing adolescent suicide attempts in an
   impoverished urban area in Peru, as part of an Official Development
   Assistance project by the Korea International Cooperation Agency. The
   PRECEDE-PROCEED model informed the effectiveness study. In this
   intervention, the participants were first to fifth grade students in
   public secondary schools. The pre-post intervention survey was conducted
   with a stratified random sampling method. A sample of 768 and 738
   students in experimental and control groups was analyzed comparatively,
   using chi-squared tests and logistic regression. This study found that
   the program had a positive effect on adolescent mental health-related
   risk behaviors and suicide attempts in the experimental group compared
   to the control group. Thus, the intervention may have helped prevent the
   increase in mental health-related risk behaviors and suicide attempts.
   Further, parental affection, when included in the intervention, had a
   significant effect on suicide attempts. As such, the involvement of
   parental affection in the intervention might be effective in preventing
   suicide attempts. To enhance the effectiveness of interventions aiming
   to prevent adolescent suicide, the participation and attention of
   parents, as well as adolescents, must be encouraged. Further, to
   maintain the effectiveness of the intervention and expand coverage to
   other schools in the neighborhood, a strategy for project sustainability
   is needed, particularly with regards to capacity-building in schools and
   communities.},

Title = {The effectiveness of a ``EspaiJove.net{''}- a school-based intervention

   reducing stigma attitudes in the adolescent population: a cluster
   randomised controlled trial},
Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},

Abstract = {Background: The aim of this study is to evaluate the short- and
   long-term effects of the universal mental health literacy intervention
   ``EspaiJove.net `` in increasing mental health knowledge, help seeking
   and reducing stigma attitudes in the adolescent population. We also
   examine whether these effects depend on the intervention intensity.
   Methods: A clustered school-based randomised controlled trial (cRCT)
   design. Subjects: 1,298 secondary pupils aged 13 and 14 were recruited
   from 18 schools in Barcelona (Spain) between September 2016 and January
   2018. Intervention: Three programmes were assessed: 1) Sensitivity
   Programme (SP; 1 h); 2) Mental Health Literacy (MHL; 6 h); 3) MHL plus a
   first-person Stigma Reduction Programme (MHL + SR; 7 h); 4) Control
   group (CG): waiting list. Outcome measures: 1) MHL: EspaiJove.net EMHL
   Test (First part and Second Part); 2) Stigma: RIBS and CAMI; 3)
   Help-seeking and use of treatment: GHSQ. Analysis: The data was
   collected at baseline, post-intervention and 6 and 12 months later. An
   intention-to-treat analysis and imputation method was used to analyse
   the missing data. Intervention effects were analysed using multilevel
   modelling. Results: One thousand thirty-two students were included (SP =
   225; MHL = 261; MHL + SR = 295 and CG = 251). The MHL and MHL + SR
   interventions showed short- and long-term an increase in knowledge
   compared to SP and CG, but no significant change post-intervention or
   over time (First part p = 0.52 and Second part p = 0.62) between
   intervention groups and CG. No significant changes were found in stigma
   scores post-intervention or over time (CAMI p = 0.61 and RIBS p = 0.98)
   or in help-seeking scores (parent p = 0.69; teacher p = 0.23 and
   healthcare professional p = 0.75). The MHL + SR intervention was the
   best valued and recommended (p < 0.005). Conclusions: The three
   interventions of the EspaiJove.net programme (SP, MHL and MHL + SR) seem
   not to be effective in terms MHL, Stigma and help-seeking behaviours.
   The contact with a person who has experimented mental illness first-hand
   did not reduce stigma attitudes. Further research should deal with the
   heterogeneity of MHL interventions (concept, duration and measures) and
   identify which components of stigma interventions are effective.},

Abstract = {It is recognized that mental health literacy is vital in both the
   prevention of mental health problems and in mental health promotion and
   empowerment of adolescents. In spite of this, only a limited number of
   tools assessing mental health literacy among adolescents have been
   developed and most of these have not been adequately tested. In this
   study, a questionnaire assessing mental health literacy was developed
   and tested using a three-step approach: 1) item generation in which the
   principles of public patient involvement were essential, 2) item testing
   and 3) exploration of psychometric properties. Internal consistency of
   the questionnaire was determined through Cronbach's alpha and
   confirmatory factor analysis was conducted in order to determine the
   construct validity of the questionnaire. The results demonstrated partly
   skewed data, good internal consistency, good Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin and
   acceptable results in the goodness of fit index. The initial results
   suggest that the questionnaire developed and validated in this study is
   valuable in assessing mental health literacy and could provide useful,
   essential information on the topic. It thus appears to be a promising
   tool in the promotion and improvement of mental health and early
   intervention of mental health problems among adolescents.},

Abstract = {Mental health literacy is vital for well-being in educational settings,
   extending beyond academics to include social and emotional development.
   It empowers individuals, allowing them to recognize and address their
   mental health needs and provide essential support to their peers.
   Despite the acknowledged importance of modifiable factors, there is a
   noticeable research gap in those amenable to change through educational
   interventions. Thus, this systematic review aims to identify potentially
   modifiable predictors of mental health literacy in the educational
   context. A systematic search was conducted for quantitative studies
   published between 2019 and October 2023 using several databases
   following PRISMA guidelines. Studies needed to focus on potentially
   modifiable predictors of mental health literacy in the educational
   context. Study quality was assessed using the Appraisal tool for
   Cross-Sectional Studies (AXIS tool). In total, 3747 titles and abstracts
   were screened, 60 articles were assessed in full-text screening, and 21
   were included in the review. Significant correlations between mental
   health literacy and modifiable predictors, including stigma toward
   professional help, self-efficacy, attitudes toward help-seeking, social
   support, positive psychological states, receiving mental health
   training, and psychological distress, were identified. By addressing
   these factors, educational institutions can cultivate community's adept
   in mental health, fostering an environment marked by empathy,
   understanding, and proactive engagement in addressing mental health
   issues. The implications serve as a foundation for future research,
   policy development, and implementing of practical strategies to enhance
   mental health literacy in diverse educational settings.},

Journal = {ADVANCES IN MENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Pages = {98-107},
Abstract = {Childcare services are an important part of life for many families.
   Childcare workers have a vital role in the development of a child's
   mental health, and yet are often under-trained in this area. This paper
   describes the implementation, evaluation and sustainability of the
   Healthy Start program in regional Western Australia, with particular
   attention to outcomes for childcare workers. Healthy Start aimed to
   build the capacity of the childcare workforce to promote the mental
   health of children attending childcare, their families and those working
   in the childcare sector. A range of strategies was developed and
   implemented, including mental health literacy training and communication
   skills training which were delivered to over thirtyfive childcare
   workers. Pre and post-training questionnaires showed that awareness of
   risk factors, protective factors and referral sources, as well as levels
   of confidence in discussing mental health issues with parents, increased
   immediately after training. Baseline and follow-up telephone surveys
   showed however that the childcare workers' awareness of risk and
   protective factors was not sustained over a twelve month period. The

Title = {Strength-based capacity-building interventions to promote adolescents'
   mental health: A systematic review and meta-analysis},

Abstract = {Strength-based capacity-building interventions have the potential to
   enhance an individual's capacity to improve their mental health. A
   systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to examine the
   effectiveness of these interventions on mental health literacy,
   resilience, self-efficacy, and positive thinking in adolescents without
   pre-existing mental/psychiatric diagnoses/conditions. CINAHL, Embase,
   PsycINFO, PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and CNKI were
   searched from inception to June 2024. Two reviewers independently
   conducted the study screening, risk of bias assessment, and data
   extraction. Leave-one-out sensitivity and subgroup analyses were used to
   reduce the heterogeneity of the studies and their findings. Forty-seven
   interventional studies were included, with approaches mainly consisting
   of psychoeducation, individual skill training (e.g., emotional
   regulation, mindfulness), and supportive peer feedback.
   Capacity-building interventions (in 27 studies) improved the levels of
   mental health literacy (SMD = 1.70, 95\% CI{[}0.57, 2.84], I-2 = 97\%, n
   = 4) and resilience (SMD = 0.51, 95\% CI{[}0.26, 0.76], I-2 = 89\%, n =
   16) in the short-term (< 1 month) and resilience in the long-term (> 6
   months; SMD = 0.29, 95\% CI{[}0.03, 0.55], I-2 = 39\%, n = 3)
   post-intervention. While there were limited studies evaluated on
   positive thinking and self-efficacy and thus unable to perform
   meta-analysis on these outcomes, the medium-term effects on resilience
   show no statistical significance (1-6 months; n = 4). However, the
   effects on depression and anxiety were nonsignificant. Combined
   approaches to capacity-building interventions that incorporate two or
   more theoretical frameworks/models within one intervention could enhance
   adolescents' resilience (SMD = 0.24, 95\% CI{[}0.13, 0.35], I-2 = 22\%,
   n = 3). Combining positive psychology with other mental health
   approaches in interventions might boost adolescents' resilience in
   short-term but there were limited studies and thus insufficient evidence
   to evaluate the medium- and long-term effectiveness of these combined
   approaches. Further rigorous large-scale randomized controlled trials
   are recommended to provide stronger evidence.},

Abstract = {Mental health disorders typically emerge in early life and can be
   modified through prompt intervention. Mental health literacy is the
   multi-dimensional knowledge of mental health disorders to recognize,
   manage, or prevent mental health disorders. Enhancing youth mental
   health literacy through information communication technologies already
   adopted by youth may be an accessible and effective approach to address
   the ongoing mental health crisis. We used an interconnected, three phase
   process following co-design methods to determine evidence-based
   consensus statements to conceptualize and develop the Youth MindTrack
   and to inform future digital tools to support youth mental health
   literacy. In Phase I, a scientific team (N = 21; 24\% youth) adhered to
   deliberative dialogue and priority setting methods to develop strategic
   priorities. Phase II consisted of a modified Delphi consensus process to
   determine evidence-based consensus statements (N = 352 (13\% youth)
   Round 1; N = 87 (33\% youth) Round 2). Semi-structured focus groups in
   Phase III were conducted to refine the consensus statements (N = 16,
   25\% youth) and design the digital mental health literacy tool (N = 24,
   33\% youth). Twenty-one consensus statements encompassing four domains
   were produced: (1) Understanding mental health (N = 4); (2) Exercising
   mental health (N = 6); (3) Engaging with digital support (N = 8); and
   (4) Evaluating digital support (N = 3). Content analysis of discussions
   identified 16 themes mapped to the domains of mental health literacy and
   user-interface, design considerations for digital tools on mental health
   literacy more broadly. The resulting design of the Youth MindTrack tool
   to support mental health literacy included four main interactive
   sections designed to be downloaded and completed by youth on a digital
   device. We determined 21 evidence-based consensus statements that
   underpinned the conceptualization and development of the Youth
   MindTrack: a downloadable digital tool to support youth mental health
   literacy. The data supports proceeding to pilot testing to assess the
   tool's usability, acceptability, and perceived effectiveness prior to
   implementation, and provides evidence that an iterative and
   participatory research-based process with youth can help adapt health
   technology to their needs.},

Abstract = {Topic: The concept of mental health literacy (MHL) was defined as the
   knowledge and beliefs about mental disorders that help in their
   recognition, management, or prevention. The complexity of interventions
   to promote adolescents' MHL requires that they be investigated through a
   process of development, feasibility/piloting, evaluation, and
   implementation, according to Medical Research Council (MRC) Framework.
   Purpose: This article aimed to identify the theory that supports the
   development of a psychoeducational intervention to promote adolescents'
   MHL in schools, possibly to be developed by mental health and
   psychiatric nurses.
   Sources Used: Journal articles, books, reports, and regulations.
   Conclusions: This theory allows us to design a psychoeducational
   intervention to promote adolescents' MHL in schools and supports the
   subsequent phases of the MRC Framework.},

Abstract = {Many mental illnesses have onset during adolescence, and if untreated

   intention to follow up referrals. Eighty-seven Australian parents of
   current secondary school students were recruited to an online
   cross-sectional survey via convenience sampling. Results showed that, on
   average, parents had good MHL, moderately endorsed school counsellor
   roles, and were committed to following up referrals. Higher MHL, but not
   preferred school counsellor roles, predicted intention to follow up
   referrals to general practitioners and specialised mental health
   services. Findings support targeted psychoeducational intervention for
   parents regarding MHL and the role of the school counsellor and
   directions for future research are discussed.},

   anxiety specific mental health literacy and mental health help-seeking
   in adolescent males},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANXIETY DISORDERS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {76},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: Poor mental health literacy and greater alignment with norms
   of hegemonic masculinity are established barriers to mental health
   help-seeking in men. However, little is known about how these variables
   influence adolescent male help-seeking and in particular, help-seeking
   for anxiety disorders. This study investigated the relationship between
   i) anxiety mental health literacy, ii) alignment with traditional
   masculinity norms and iii) help-seeking attitudes, intentions and
   behaviour in a sample of adolescent males.
   Methods: 1732 adolescent males (aged 12-18 years) participated online
   whilst at school.
   Results: Participant attitudes towards formal help-seeking, intentions
   to seek help from a family member and from an online source were found
   to predict professional help-seeking behaviour by the adolescent and/or
   by their parents on the adolescents' behalf. In adolescents with a low
   or average personal alignment with norms of hegemonic masculinity,
   greater anxiety mental health literacy was positively associated with
   more favourable attitudes towards formal and informal help-seeking.
   However, this relationship was not found in adolescent males with a
   greater alignment with norms of hegemonic masculinity.
   Limitations: The study had a correlational research design and used
   self-report measures.
   Conclusions: Mental health initiatives which consider the impact of
   masculinity and gender stereotypes have the potential to significantly
   improve help-seeking in this population.},

Title = {Increasing Mental Health Literacy in Law Enforcement to Improve Best
   Practices in Policing-Introduction of an Empirically Derived, Modular,
   Differentiated, and End-User Driven Training Design},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Month = {AUG 2},
Abstract = {Objective: Law enforcement officers often have contact to persons who
   show symptoms of mental disorders. Adequately designed training is
   necessary for developing the best possible practices in policing when
   coming into contact with mentally ill people, and may help to expand
   their general knowledge on mental disorders. To achieve a sustainable
   implementation of training content in daily policing work, the
   acceptance and proactive integration of methods by the training
   participants is essential.
   Method: This study investigates an exemplary modular training curriculum
   based on a survey with 2,228 German police officers (28.2\% female,
   71.8\% male) concerning their needs and challenges when coming into
   contact with persons with mental disorders. This empirical end-user
   driven approach was used to adapt existing training concepts to the
   current needs and interests of law enforcement personnel in order to
   maximize compliance.
   Results: The training program draft includes basic modules which are
   intended to be of direct interest to all police officers, such as mental
   disorders with high policing relevance, encountering suicidal patients,
   (non-directive) communication and de-escalation skills, and mental
   hygiene in policing. They are arranged in more specialized modules that
   address specific target group audiences within police forces and the
   training curriculum provides information about genuine risks and
   self-protection, trauma sensitivity, and interaction with children and
   victims among other contents. The self-selectable, modular, and
   empirically-based continued training program also includes an
   introduction to local mental health service professionals and networks,
   trialogue sequences, and situational role play scenarios.
   Conclusion: Due to frequent contact law enforcement officers have to
   mentally ill people, improved training designed to maximize knowledge
   and the integration of trained methods is necessary. Gaining acceptance
   and proactive support by trainees is ensured through end-user driven
   implementation of specialized and differentiated up-to-date training
   programs. Our results showcase how police officers' perspectives on
   persons with mental illnesses is a main aspect that can and should be
   used to encourage training course designs.},

Title = {Mental health literacy and its relationship with suicidal tendencies

Journal = {BMC PSYCHOLOGY},

Abstract = {Objective Mental health challenges among adolescents have become a
   critical public health concern, particularly given the increasing
   prevalence of suicidal behaviours in this age group. While the
   relationships between mental health literacy, social support, and
   suicide risk have been studied globally, there is limited evidence from
   culturally specific contexts, particularly in less urbanized regions of
   Iran such as Khoy city. This study aimed to investigate mental health
   literacy) ability to understand and manage their own and others' mental
   health (and its relationship with suicidal tendencies, mediated by
   social support, among students. Methods This was a cross-sectional study
   conducted in 2024 in Khoy city, West-Azerbaijan, Iran. The study
   included 605 high-school students from six selected schools, who were
   selected through two-step random sampling. Mental Health Literacy,
   social support and suicide tendency questionnaires along with
   demographic information were used for data gathering. Data were analyzed
   using IBM SPSS AMOS Statistics 24 software. A structural equation
   modeling was employed to evaluate the relationships between the study
   variables and to test the conceptual framework. Results The structural
   model results revealed significant direct and indirect associations
   among the variables. Mental Health Literacy (MHL) positively influenced
   the social support (beta = 0.135, P = 0.03), while socioeconomic status
   (SES) also had a positive effect (beta = 0.203, P < 0.001). Social
   support was found to negatively affect suicide tendency (beta = -0.823,
   P < 0.001). Although MHL did not directly impact suicide tendency, it
   had a significant negative indirect effect through social support (beta
   = -0.112, P = 0.04). SES also indirectly reduced suicide tendency (beta
   = -0.167, P < 0.001). Living with parents had a direct negative effect
   on suicide tendency (beta = -0.081, P = 0.04). Conclusions Based on the
   findings of this study, the importance of integrating mental health
   literacy into curricula, establishing peer support networks, and
   strengthening family-school collaboration within existing frameworks
   such as the WHO Action Plan is emphasized. Furthermore, these results
   may provide a foundation for developing localized guidelines aimed at
   enhancing mental health literacy and social support in schools; however,
   longitudinal and intervention studies are necessary to confirm the
   effectiveness of these recommendations.},

Title = {Project SUMS (scaling up of mental health in schools): design and

   integrated school mental health intervention for adolescents},
Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 6},
Abstract = {Background: There is an increasing need for Mental Health Promotion
   (MHP) among adolescents, especially in developing countries with limited
   resources and rapid socio-demographic transition. With the growing
   burden of mental health problems among adolescents (suicide, depression)
   and their preferences to seek help from their peers, improving Mental
   Health Literacy (MHL) and behaviours for First Aid in Mental Health
   (MH-FA) becomes crucial to promote their mental health.
   Methods: Schools are ideal settings for reaching the vulnerable
   adolescents. The proposed study evaluates the effectiveness of a
   classroom-based teacher-led integrated school mental health intervention
   called SUMS (MHP + MHL + MH-FA). The study will involve a pragmatic,
   cluster-randomised waitlist-controlled design to evaluate the
   effectiveness of SUMS intervention using schools as
   unit-of-randomisation. The study will be conducted in Srinivaspura
   taluka (Sub-district) of Kolar district (administrative unit of health)
   of Karnataka in collaboration with a multi-disciplinary expert team from
   NIMHANS (National Institute of Mental Health And Neuro Sciences),
   Bangalore-India and Department of Education, Government of Karnataka,
   India. A total of 8 schools (400 students studying in 6-8 grade) from
   Srinivaspura taluka will be randomised into intervention and waitlist
   control group. The intervention group will receive SUMS intervention
   through 10-15 h of classroom sessions. The primary outcome is the
   improvement in positive mental health literacy, as measured by the
   Mental Health-Promoting Knowledge (MHPK-10) scale. Changes in MH-FA
   knowledge and intentions, Mental health stigma, help-seeking and
   resilience are assessed as secondary outcomes. Data will be collected at
   baseline, 6-weeks, 6-months and 12-months post-intervention. The
   waitlist-control schools will receive the interventions at the end of
   the 12-month follow-up assessment in intervention-schools.
   Discussion: This is the first study to integrate Mental Health Literacy
   with Mental Health Promotion and behaviours for First Aid in Mental
   Health to promote mental health well-being among adolescent school
   children in India. With a need to build a more substantial evidence base
   on School Mental Health Promotion approaches in developing countries,
   the study findings will have implications for implementing and
   operationalising Health and Wellness Ambassador initiative in India.},

Abstract = {Objective: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the
   effectiveness of a group psychosocial intervention for children (aged
   12-18) of a parent with mental illness (copmi).
   Method: A treatment and waitlist-control design study with pre- and
   post-treatment, and 8 week follow up, was carried out. The treatment (n
   = 27) and control (n = 17) groups were compared on three groups of
   dependent variables: intervention targets (mental health literacy,
   connectedness, coping strategies), adjustment (depression, life
   satisfaction, prosocial behaviour, emotional/behavioural difficulties),
   and caregiving experiences.
   Results: Group comparisons failed to show statistically significant
   intervention effects, but reliable clinical change analyses suggested
   that compared to the control group, more intervention participants had
   clinically significant improvements in mental health literacy,
   depression, and life satisfaction. These treatment gains were maintained
   8 weeks after treatment. Participant satisfaction data supported these
   treatment gains.
   Conclusions: Given study limitations and the modest support for
   intervention effectiveness it is important that this and other similar
   interventions should continue to be revised and undergo rigorous
   evaluation.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to conduct an evaluation of Reach Out
   Central (ROC), an online gaming program designed to support the mental
   health of people aged 16-25. The evaluation sought to determine the
   benefit of playing ROC on alcohol use, use of coping strategies,
   psychological distress, resilience and satisfaction with life. Changes
   in mental health literacy, mental health stigma and willingness to seek
   help and program satisfaction were also investigated. A single group (N
   = 266) quasi-experimental repeated measures (pre-, post-program, 2-month
   follow-up) design was employed. The results demonstrated positive
   improvements across all outcome measures for females; however, a
   non-significant worsening effect was observed for males on seeking
   support, avoidance and resilience. Improvements for both genders were
   observed on mental health literacy and help-seeking. However, literacy
   levels and help-seeking were significantly higher, and stigma
   significantly lower for females. Program satisfaction ratings were high
   irrespective of gender. Although some inconsistencies between genders
   were noted, ROC appears to enhance protective factors for the prevention
   or early intervention of mental health disorders. The results of this
   study need to be viewed with its limitations in mind, specifically, the
   use of an open trial methodology and the small number of male

Title = {Mental health issues and the association of mental health literacy among
   adolescents in urban Ethiopia},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {19},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 24},
Abstract = {Background Epidemiological evidence about the prevalence of adolescent
   mental health issues and their association with mental health literacy
   is crucial for sustained mental health promotion strategies. Adolescence
   is a critical life stage for mental health promotion. However, evidence
   is not available among Ethiopian school adolescents. Hence, the present
   study examined the prevalence of adolescents' mental health issues and
   their correlation with mental health literacy. Materials and methods A
   cross-sectional study was conducted among adolescents (grades 5-12) in
   Dire Dawa city, Eastern Ethiopia using multistage random sampling. Data
   was collected using the Strength and Difficulty Questionnaire, WHO-5
   well-being index, and mental health literacy questionnaire. SPSS version
   25 was used for the descriptive, Chi-square, binary logistic regression,
   and correlation analyses. Results Between 14.0-24.5\% of adolescents had
   reported mental health problems: internalizing problems (14.9-28.8\%),
   emotional problems (10.4-25.5\%), and peer relationship problems
   (17.8-25.5\%). These mental health problems were significantly greater
   among adolescents who had either themselves or their family members used
   psychoactive substances (p <= 0.05). Females from upper elementary (5-8
   grade) and lower secondary (9-10) grade levels had a higher prevalence
   of mental health problems (AOR: 2.60 (0.95-7.10, p<0.05)). The effect of
   age, parental education, or employment status was insignificant
   (p>0.05). The prevalence of depression ranged from 18.0-25.5\%. Mental
   health literacy was negatively correlated with total difficulties scores
   and positively associated with mental well-being scores (p<0.05).
   Conclusion The prevalence of adolescents' mental health problems was
   higher. It implied that promoting mental health literacy could enhance
   adolescents' positive mental health. Intervention programs should
   prioritize vulnerable groups and individuals reporting symptoms of
   mental health difficulties. Future studies should involve qualitative
   studies and consider effect of other determinants.},

Title = {Elite athlete initiatives in school mental health: crafting an art-based
   educational methodology for promoting mental health help-seeking},
Journal = {DISCOVER MENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 9},
Abstract = {Art-based practices have been expected and incorporated into adolescent
   mental health education, enhanced by their potential to promote positive
   psychosocial development and foster resilience. Elite athletes, while
   encountering similar challenges as adolescents-such as reluctance to
   seek psychological support-occupy a distinctive position due to their
   capacity to exert substantial influence on youth. This paper presents
   the development and conceptualization of a novel, elite athlete-led
   mental health education framework that employs artistic expression as a
   core modality. We showed and explained the `Yowai-wa-Tsuyoi Project'
   ('Weakness is Strength'), an initiative undertaken in Japan that seeks
   to harness the personal narratives of elite athletes to effect positive
   change in adolescents' mental health literacy. By collaborating with the
   Japan Rugby Players Association and mental health experts, the project
   integrates art-based interventions to stimulate dialogue on mental
   health, stress, and overall well-being. By sharing their lived
   experiences, athletes facilitate art-driven activities wherein students
   are encouraged to express and reflect upon their mental health
   experiences. This interdisciplinary initiative aspires to enhance
   adolescents' understanding of mental health through relatable athlete
   role models, foster emotional articulation via artistic media, and
   nurture empathy and collective support for mental well-being. The
   integration of sports, education, and art in this approach illustrates a
   potentially transformative model for engaging adolescents in critical
   discourse surrounding mental health and well-being. Furthermore, it
   underscores the importance of creating educational environments that
   embrace vulnerability, expression, and dialogue, thus providing students
   with the tools and space to address their mental health in a supportive
   context.},

Title = {Development and evaluation of a youth mental health community awareness
   campaign - The Compass Strategy},
Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {6},
Month = {AUG 22},
Abstract = {Background: Early detection and treatment of mental disorders in
   adolescents and young adults can lead to better health outcomes. Mental
   health literacy is a key to early recognition and help seeking. Whilst a
   number of population health initiatives have attempted to improve mental
   health literacy, none to date have specifically targeted young people
   nor have they applied the rigorous standards of population health models
   now accepted as best practice in other health areas. This paper
   describes the outcomes from the application of a health promotion model
   to the development, implementation and evaluation of a community
   awareness campaign designed to improve mental health literacy and early
   help seeking amongst young people.
   Method: The Compass Strategy was implemented in the western metropolitan
   Melbourne and Barwon regions of Victoria, Australia. The Precede-Proceed
   Model guided the population assessment, campaign strategy development
   and evaluation. The campaign included the use of multimedia, a website,
   and an information telephone service. Multiple levels of evaluation were
   conducted. This included a cross-sectional telephone survey of mental
   health literacy undertaken before and after 14 months of the campaign
   using a quasi-experimental design. Randomly selected independent samples
   of 600 young people aged 12 - 25 years from the experimental region and
   another 600 from a comparison region were interviewed at each time
   point. A series of binary logistic regression analyses were used to
   measure the association between a range of campaign outcome variables
   and the predictor variables of region and time.
   Results: The program was judged to have an impact on the following
   variables, as indicated by significant region-by-time interaction
   effects ( p < 0.05): awareness of mental health campaigns,
   self-identified depression, help for depression sought in the previous
   year, correct estimate of prevalence of mental health problems,
   increased awareness of suicide risk, and a reduction in perceived
   barriers to help seeking. These effects may be underestimated because
   media distribution error resulted in a small amount of print material
   ``leaking{''} into the comparison region.
   Conclusion: We believe this is the first study to apply the rigorous
   standards of a health promotion model including the use of a control
   region to a mental health population intervention. The program achieved
   many of its aims despite the relatively short duration and moderate
   intensity of the campaign.},

Title = {Psychometric properties of the Turkish version of the universal mental

Abstract = {Purpose: While enhancing mental health literacy is a critical component
   of preventive mental health, there is currently no mental health
   literacy instrument specific to adolescents in Turkey. This study aimed
   to adapt the universal mental health literacy scale for adolescents
   (UMHL-A) to Turkish and determine its validity and reliability. Methods:
   This methodological study utilized data collected from 268 adolescents
   aged 10 to 14 years, between April and June 2024. Data were obtained
   using a personal information form and the UMHL-A. The construct validity
   of the scale was evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis, and its
   reliability was assessed with internal consistency and test-retest
   reliability. Results: The scale consists of two parts: the Likert
   UMHL-A, a five-point scale to determine adolescents' attitudes, and the
   T/F UMHL-A, a true/false scale to measure their knowledge. In this
   study, it was shown that the Likert UMHL-A, which includes 8 items and
   two factors, namely help-seeking and stigma, and the T/F UMHL-A, which
   consists 9 items and two factors namely mental health knowledge and
   mental illness knowledge, had good fit indices. The Cronbach's alpha
   reliability coefficient was 0.934 for the Likert UMHL-A, and 0.862 for
   the T/F UMHL-A. The item-total score correlation coefficients of the
   Likert UMHL-A ranged between 0.582 and 0.856, whereas those of the T/F
   UMHL-A varied between 0.483 and 0.804. Conclusion: The Turkish version
   of the UMHL-A is a valid and reliable tool for assessing adolescents'
   mental health literacy. Implications for practice: Health professionals
   can use this brief and easy-to-apply instrument in clinical practices or
   educational programs to identify and improve adolescents' mental health
   literacy. (c) 2024 Elsevier Inc. All rights are reserved, including

   web-based educational interventions on mental health literacy, stigma,
   and help-seeking intentions/attitudes among young people. The results
   showed that web-based educational interventions improved mental health
   literacy knowledge, but not stigma or help-seeking outcomes. The study
   suggested several recommendations to enhance the effectiveness of
   web-based educational interventions on stigma and help-seeking outcomes,
   such as using more rigorous designs and methods, more comprehensive and
   multifaceted interventions, more tailored and targeted interventions,
   and more collaborative and participatory approaches. The study concluded
   that web-based educational interventions may have a greater impact on
   reducing stigma and promoting help-seeking among young people, which may
   ultimately lead to better mental health outcomes and well-being for this

Abstract = {Rates of depression are the highest in adolescence in comparison to any
   other period of the life course. Yet, when depressed, the majority of
   adolescents do not seek formal help to treat their suffering.
   School-based mental health literacy of depression interventions aim to
   improve adolescents' help-seeking for depression, by enhancing their
   knowledge about depression, fostering positive attitudes toward
   depression and help-seeking, and encouraging behavioral self-efficacy in
   help-seeking. While widespread, the effectiveness of these programs is
   inconsistent, and when properly evaluated, they only increase depressed
   adolescents' help-seeking behavior at modest rates. This review argues
   that these interventions lack consideration of several important domains
   of adolescent development, as well as what is known about
   decision-making in the depressed adolescent mind. Accordingly, the
   specific cognitive and socio-emotional processes involved in adolescent
   decision-making are reviewed in order to highlight avenues for improving
   mental health literacy and help-seeking in depressed young people.
   Specific recommendations for program delivery are discussed.},

Abstract = {Background: Prevalence of depression is growing in India, especially
   among adolescents, but often goes unrecognized and untreated. Lack of
   Mental Health Literacy is one of the reasons for the same. Aim: To
   assess Mental Health Literacy in school-going adolescents in terms of
   recognition of mental illness, etiology, management and personal stigma.
   Methods: The questionnaire consisted of a vignette of a person with
   depression followed by a series of questions to assess recognition of
   the disorder, help-seeking intentions, and beliefs about interventions,
   causes, risk factors, outcomes, methods of prevention and stigmatizing
   attitudes. Results: 354 adolescents participated in the study of which
   83.6\% correctly identified a depression vignette. 59.5\% adolescents
   feel that depression is caused by external factors such as stressful
   life event, childhood hardship, breathing polluted air, alcohol or drug
   abuse. 26.1\% feel that depression is caused due to personal reasons
   such as weak character, poor coping skills or due to god punishing past
   sins. 14.4\% believe that depression is due to biological causes such as
   brain disease, chemical imbalance or genes. 28\% of the adolescents were
   of the opinion that a psychologist/counsellor was the best form of help
   for someone with depression, 21.5\% felt that family/friends were the
   best form of help. 6.2\% thought that the best way to deal with the
   problem was to ignore it and hope that it goes away. The most common
   reason cited for not seeking help was that the subject was ashamed or
   uncomfortable about asking for help. Conclusion: The results presented
   in this paper reveal some lacunae in the mental health literacy of
   adolescents. This may be addressed through appropriate health promotion
   interventions to improve the knowledge, attitude and ultimately
   practices related to mental health disorders},

   youth and youth-involved Latino community leaders (n = 18) yielded three
   overarching themes crucial to a culturally tailored depression
   prevention intervention: (1) utilize a multipronged and sustainable
   intervention approach, (2) raise awareness about depression in
   culturally meaningful ways, and (3) promote Latino youth's social
   connection and cultural enrichment activities. Findings suggest that
   both adaptation of existing prevention programs and development of
   hybrid approaches may be necessary to reduce depression/suicide
   disparities for Latino youth. One such hybrid program informed by
   community stakeholders is described.},

Abstract = {teen Mental Health First Aid (teenMHFA) is a school-based mental health
   program that trains adolescents to support peers who are experiencing
   mental health problems or crises. The program has been evaluated for
   adolescents aged 15-18 years as part of a randomized controlled trial,
   however qualitative feedback from students on their perceptions of the
   program is yet to be explored. The current study describes the
   perspectives of students who took part in the trial. Feedback on the
   perceived strengths and weaknesses of the program was provided by 979
   Year 10 students (M = 15.82 years, female = 43.94\%, English as a first
   language = 72.77\%) at four government funded public schools in
   Melbourne, Australia via online surveys. A content and thematic analysis
   was performed on the data using a six-step process. Students generally
   found the program relevant and they connected with the visual material,
   personal stories and interactive activities. Suggestions for
   improvements included encouraging active student participation in
   classroom discussion and providing opportunities to practice skills.
   School-based mental health education can benefit from input from
   stakeholder perspectives, particularly when designing mental health
   content for delivery by external trainers.},

   found that existing previously-validated measures had good psychometric
   properties, with two new questionnaires demonstrating reasonable
   reliability (self-help confidence alpha = 0.78, mental health knowledge
   alpha = 0.59). There were indications of improvement in help-seeking
   intentions, the number of sources likely to seek help from, and mental
   health knowledge from pre- to post-intervention. A future trial of PEP

Abstract = {Introduction Mental health education is essential for preparing
   healthcare professionals to address the growing needs of patients with
   mental health challenges. The aim of this study was to understand the
   current landscape of teaching and learning approaches to mental health
   education for undergraduate health profession students.MethodologyA
   realist review was chosen to explore what works for whom, how, and why
   in teaching and learning for mental health education for undergraduate
   health profession students. The search strategy was developed
   iteratively, with support from a research librarian, and additional
   searches supplemented the initial search. Following screening in
   duplicate, the selected studies were appraised for relevance, richness
   and rigour. Intervention (I), Context (C), Actor (A), Mechanism (M) and
   Outcome (O) configurations were extracted from the data and analysed for
   patterns and conceptual areas. Stakeholder and Patient and Public
   Involvement panels supported the refinement of both the Initial
   Programme Theory (IPT) and Programme Theories (PT).Results78 articles
   were included. The results identified three critical program theories:
   (1) direct contact with individuals with lived experience (2),
   longitudinal and integrative learning approach, and (3) diversity of
   experiential and community-engaged learning. Integrating these theories
   into health education curricula may lead to professionals better
   prepared to address mental health challenges.ConclusionOur realist
   review identified three critical programme theories for teaching and
   learning strategies that foster this literacy, including direct
   engagement with individuals who have lived experiences, a longitudinal
   and integrative approach to education, and a diverse array of
   experiential and community-engaged learning opportunities.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL METHODS IN SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING},

Abstract = {Issues of mental health among higher vocational education students have
   attracted growing concern, fueling the need for novel pedagogical
   approaches that can foster psychological resilience. This study details
   the design and implementation of an innovative Virtual Reality (VR)
   pedagogical framework for mental health courses in higher vocational
   education settings. The research addresses the limitations of
   conventional pedagogical approaches through the use of immersive VR
   technology to create experiential learning spaces that foster the
   development of psychological resilience. Through a mixed-methods
   research design, we created an extensive VR-based curriculum with four
   main modules: stress management simulation, social interaction training,
   problem-solving under pressure, and exercises on emotional regulation. A
   12 week experiment was carried out with 200 higher vocational students,
   comparing the effects of the VR intervention group with a control group
   receiving conventional instruction. Quantitative results revealed
   significant improvements in psychological resilience scores (Cohen's d =
   0.78, p < 0.001). Qualitative findings revealed significant improvements
   in student engagement, skill transfer to real-life situations, and
   self-efficacy in coping with psychological adversity. The virtual
   reality (VR) model showed greater educational efficacy in terms of
   knowledge retention, with a 23\% improvement, as well as in practical
   skill application, which showed a 31\% improvement compared to
   traditional learning methods. This study presents an empirically
   supported model for incorporating VR technology in mental health
   training, providing data-driven recommendations for its use in
   professional settings and opening the door for new approaches utilizing
   VR technology to enhance psychological resilience.},

Title = {Mental Health Literacy Programs for Parents of Adolescents: A Systematic
   Review},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {MAY 2},
Abstract = {Introduction: Many mental illnesses begin during adolescence. Parents of
   adolescents need to have sufficient mental health literacy (MHL) to
   recognize mental health problems in their children and to assist them
   with help-seeking. Although several educational programs have been
   developed to enhance parental MHL, their effectiveness has not been
   established. This study provides a systematic review for the
   effectiveness of MHL programs in parents of adolescents.
   Methods: PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC and Web of Science were searched
   from the earliest date possible until February 2022; references of
   studies which met eligibility criteria were also screened. Studies that
   assessed quantitative change in at least one of the following components
   of parental MHL were included: knowledge of mental health/illnesses;
   stigma toward people with mental health problems; confidence in helping
   children with mental health problems, and intention, knowledge or
   behavior of helping children with mental health problems. Risk of bias
   (ROB) for each outcome within the included studies was rated using the
   revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials for randomized
   controlled trials (RCTs), and the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for
   Nonrandomized Studies for nonrandomized studies.
   Results: Nine studies (four RCTs, three controlled before-and-after
   studies, and two case series), reported in 10 articles, were included.
   Mental health knowledge and/or confidence was significantly improved in
   several studies, while no studies observed significant improvement in
   stigma and/or intention/behavior of helping children. ROB was high in
   five out of nine studies (10 out of 18 outcomes) and unclear in the
   others.
   Conclusions: A limited number of studies have evaluated effects of MHL
   program in parents and inconsistent quality contributes to difficulty in
   establishing their overall effectiveness. More studies with appropriate
   methods of recruitment, measurement and analysis, and transparent
   reporting are needed.},

Abstract = {Background: Parents play an important role in the lives of adolescents,
   and supporting and addressing the needs of families continue to be the
   focus of many researchers and policy makers. Mobile health interventions
   have great potential for supporting parents at a population level
   because of their broad reach and convenience. However, limited evidence
   exists for such interventions for parents of adolescents. This study
   reports on the formative work conducted with parents and/or primary
   caregivers to identify their needs and preferences for the development
   of MyTeen-an SMS text messaging program on promoting parental competence
   and mental health literacy for parents of adolescents (aged 10-15
   years).
   Objective: The aim of this qualitative study was to explore parents
   and/or primary caregivers' perspectives around youth well-being,
   parenting, and parenting support and their input on the development of
   MyTeen SMS text messaging parenting intervention.
   Methods: A total of 5 focus groups (n=45) were conducted with parents or
   primary caregivers of adolescents aged 10 to 15 years between October
   and December 2017 in New Zealand A semistructured interview guideline
   and prompts were used. Data were audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed
   using inductive thematic analysis.
   Results: Participants were concerned about youth mental health (ie,
   stigma and increasing demand on adolescents), and a number of parenting
   challenges (ie, social expectations, time, impact of technology, changes
   in family communication pattern, and recognizing and talking about
   mental health issues) were noted. Importantly, participants reported the
   lack of services and support available for families, and many were not
   aware of services for parents themselves. A number of recommendations
   were given on the style, content, and frequency of developing the text
   messaging program.
   Conclusions: Findings from this qualitative work informed the
   development of MyTeen, an SMS text messaging program designed to
   increase parental competence and improve mental health literacy for
   parents of adolescents.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SPORTS AND ACTIVE LIVING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Month = {SEP 21},
Abstract = {Introduction: There is a need to change the culture within the art of
   dance, as it has been associated with injuries and mental health
   consequences. This study evaluates an intervention designed to increase
   mental health literacy, enhance nutritional knowledge, reduce symptoms
   and effects of low energy availability, and strengthen understanding of
   sports nutrition and recovery strategies, in dance students of mixed
   genders.
   Material and methods: A total of 125 dance students received three
   workshops, with 39 arts and crafts students serving as references. The
   results were evaluated by the Eating Disorder Examination questionnaire,
   the Low Energy Availability in Females questionnaire, the Hopkins
   Symptom Check List, and questions on mental health literacy, sports
   nutrition, and recovery knowledge.
   Results: Dance students achieved sustained improvements in mental health
   and nutrition knowledge and temporary improvements in driven exercise
   (i.e., performing exercise because of a compulsive drive). No other
   benefits were identified from the intervention.
   Conclusion: Our findings indicate the need for an ongoing education
   program to reduce the occurrence and development of negative mental
   health outcomes and tow energy availability in professional dance
   students. Such approaches may not only improve the mental health of
   dance students but also potentially prevent the high frequency of
   injuries.},

Title = {Animal-Assisted Mental Health Education for Veterinary Students},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VETERINARY MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {52},
Number = {5},
Pages = {598-605},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Veterinary students often face mental health challenges due to the
   demanding nature of their studies and the pressures of adopting to their
   future profession. To address this issue, an animal-assisted education
   in mental health (AAE-MH) program was developed and implemented at a
   veterinary school in Hong Kong. The primary goal of the AAE-MH program
   was to enhance students' mental health literacy, raise awareness of
   mental health topics, and improve their help-seeking behavior and
   overall well-being. By leveraging the students' natural affinity for
   animals, the program incorporated a blend of course-based and
   experiential learning activities to tackle the often-taboo topic of
   mental health in the veterinary field. The AAE-MH program consisted of
   six sessions, each lasting 1 hour and 50 minutes. Two of these sessions
   involved 1 hour of learning from certified therapy dogs. This
   interdisciplinary program drew expertise from veterinary mental health
   professionals, psychologists, animal-assisted therapists, and veterinary
   school faculty. This collaborative effort ensured that the program
   covered both the biomedical and humanistic aspects of veterinary
   medicine, preparing students to better understand and support their own
   and their peers' mental well-being. The AAE-MH program was conducted
   during the COVID-19 pandemic, and appropriate precautionary measures
   were taken. This teaching tip outlines the key elements of the program,
   including the course design, delivery, and evaluation of its
   effectiveness. We hope that this framework can provide fellow educators
   with the opportunity to potentially adapt and implement similar
   initiatives within their own veterinary education contexts, ultimately
   benefiting the entire veterinary profession.},

Volume = {39},

Abstract = {Poor adolescent mental health calls for universal prevention. The Mental
   Health Foundation's `Peer Education Project' equips older students
   ('peer educators') to teach younger students ('peer learners') about
   mental health. The peer-led lessons cover defining good and bad mental
   health, risk and protective factors, self-care, help-seeking and looking
   after one another. While previous pre-post evaluations have suggested
   effectiveness, the mechanisms through which the intervention improves
   mental health literacy remain unclear. We purposively recruited seven
   secondary schools across England from 2020 to 2022 and collected data
   through five observations, 12 staff interviews and 15 student focus
   groups (totalling 134 students; 46 peer educators aged 14-18 years and
   88 peer learners aged 11-13 years). Our realist analysis adopted
   retroductive logic, intertwining deductive and inductive approaches to
   test the initial programme theory against insights arising from the
   data. We developed Context-Mechanisms-Outcome configurations related to
   four themes: (i) modelling behaviours and forming supportive
   relationships, (ii) relevant and appropriate content, (iii) peer
   educators feeling empowered and (iV) a school culture that prioritises
   mental health support. Our refined programme theory highlights key
   mechanisms, contexts conducive to achieving the outcomes and ways to
   improve training, recruitment and delivery to maximise effectiveness for
   similar peer-led initiatives.},

   learn mental illness information because knowledge is power, and to
   express difficult feelings about being a child of a mentally ill parent
   that was risky. Participants used humor to manage group expectations,
   revealing how they made sense of their parents' problems, as well as
   their own. Suggestions are made for determining good mental health
   literacy based on children's preferences for explaining circumstances in
   ways they find relevant, and for supporting children's competencies to

   engagement with emotional and behavioral health services. The FAFI is a
   guided conversation with families about results of their

   enhancement. It differs from other assessment-with-feedback
   interventions by extending the focus of assessment beyond the target
   child to parents and the family environment, addressing parental
   emotional and behavioral problems and competencies, spanning a broad
   range of children's and parents' strengths and difficulties, and being
   generalizable to many settings and practitioners. Participants were 81
   families in primary care pediatrics. The FAFI was associated with a
   significant increase in parental mental health literacy and with an
   increase in parental attitudinal engagement with health supports and
   services that closely approached statistical significance (p = .052),

Abstract = {Purpose Australian paramedics regularly encounter patients experiencing
   mental illness. However, some paramedics hold negative attitudes towards
   the use of emergency services in providing care for these patients.
   Thus, the purpose of the present study was to examine the mental health
   literacy (MHL) of Australian paramedic students, and the training and
   experiential factors associated with MHL. Design/methodology/approach A
   cross-sectional online survey was delivered to paramedic students across
   Australia. A total of 94 paramedic students completed the survey
   examining MHL, mental health first aid (MHFA) intentions, confidence in
   providing help, personal and perceived stigma and willingness to
   interact with a person experiencing mental illness. Findings
   Participants generally had poor MHFA intentions in spite of good
   recognition of mental health disorders and good knowledge about mental
   health. Participants also demonstrated low stigmatising attitudes
   towards mental illness; however, they expressed a lack of willingness to
   interact with a person experiencing mental illness. Originality/value
   Our findings propose a combination of work-based experience and specific
   MHFA training may be beneficial to paramedic students to improve care
   for patients experiencing mental illness.},

Title = {Mental Health Literacy Content for Children of Parents with a Mental
   Illness: Thematic Analysis of a Literature Review},
Journal = {BRAIN SCIENCES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Millions of children have a parent with a mental illness (COPMI). These
   children are at higher risk of acquiring behavioural, developmental and
   emotional difficulties. Most children, including COPMI, have low levels
   of mental health literacy (MHL), meaning they do not have accurate,
   non-stigmatized information. There is limited knowledge about what kind
   of MHL content should be delivered to children. The aim of this
   exploratory study is to identify the knowledge content needed for
   general population children and COPMI to increase their MHL. A second
   aim is to explore content for emerging children's MHL scales.
   Researchers created and analyzed a literature review database. Thematic
   analysis yielded five main mental health knowledge themes for children:
   (1) attaining an overview of mental illness and recovery; (2) reducing
   mental health stigma; (3) building developmental resiliencies; (4)
   increasing help-seeking capacities; and (5) identifying risk factors for
   mental illness. COPMI appeared to need the same kind of MHL knowledge
   content, but with extra family-contextual content such as dealing with
   stigma experiences, managing stress, and communicating about parental
   mental illness. There is a need for MHL programs, validated scales, and
   research on what works for prevention and early intervention with COPMI
   children.},

Abstract = {Objective: To measure awareness of beyondblue: the national depression
   initiative and Ybblue (the youth program of beyondblue) in Australian
   young people and associations between awareness and measures of mental
   health literacy.
   Method: A national telephone survey of mental health literacy was
   conducted with 3746 young people aged 12-25 years. Participants were
   asked to spontaneously recall organizations related to mental health
   problems, as well as whether they recognized beyondblue.
   Results: Overall, 44\% of young people were aware of beyondblue,
   including 12.1\% who spontaneously recalled beyondblue as an
   organization related to mental health problems. Awareness was lower in
   males and generally increased with age. Awareness of beyondblue was
   associated with better recognition of depression and greater exposure to
   depression in self or family and friends. Participants aware of
   beyondblue were more likely to rate antidepressants and some
   professional interventions as helpful for depression, and were less
   likely to rate dealing with the problem alone or using alcohol as
   helpful. Awareness was not associated with social distance scores or
   psychological distress.
   Conclusions: beyondblue: the national depression initiative has reached
   a good proportion of Australian young people, and awareness is
   associated with better mental health literacy. Males and younger
   adolescents could be targeted for improvements in awareness.},

Abstract = {Postgraduate students as a highly educated training of highly educated
   personnel, mental health status has been widely concerned about the
   community to strengthen the mental health education of postgraduate
   students, has become a new era of postgraduate education which cannot be
   ignored an important issue. Mental health education evaluation is an
   important means to test the work of mental health, evaluation system is
   to carry out the evaluation of the basic work. Based on the
   postgraduate's mental health education system, this paper constructs the
   evaluation system of postgraduate's mental health education. The
   evaluation system consists of six first-level indicators, ``organization
   and management, educational input, team building, educational process,
   educational approach and educational effect{''}. Each level index also
   contains five secondary indicators. Individual indicators can be
   adjusted to improve the scientific nature of the evaluation results when
   face with practical applications.},

Abstract = {Purpose Early detection of eating disorders (EDs) could improve their
   prognosis, decrease morbidity and mortality, and prevent the risk of
   evolution towards a chronic form and somatic, psychiatric and
   psychosocial complications. The objective of this review was to examine
   the current scientific data concerning the early detection of EDs, which
   is one of the facets of secondary prevention. Method A scoping
   literature review was carried out following the PRISMA-ScR criteria,
   including all articles on ED detection published up to 2021 on PUBMED
   and PSYCINFO. Results 43 articles were included. Anorexia nervosa and
   bulimia nervosa were the most widely studied disorders. The articles
   focused on professionals from the medical field (GPs, psychiatrists,
   gynaecologists, gastroenterologists and residents), from the paramedical
   field, from education and sport, and from the general population. The
   assessments conducted with the professionals receiving interventions
   aiming to improve detection demonstrated their efficacy. Interventions
   for ED detection in the general population and at school seemed less
   efficacious. Conclusion The results highlighted some lines of action to
   be implemented. They pointed towards improving initial and continuing
   education for professional carers; e-learning could be an interesting
   solution for continuing education. Improving training with specific
   instructors, school personnel and sports professionals is also one of
   the solutions for a better detection of EDs. Specific recommendations
   could be published for fitness centre professionals to help them to deal
   with clients suspected of having an ED. Among secondary school students
   and in the general population, a better dissemination of mental health
   literacy and the development of mental health first aid programs could
   help improve early detection.},

Abstract = {Objective: Available evidence suggests that children hold negative views
   about mental illness. Studies show that it is possible for schools and
   mental health services to jointly undertake child and adolescent mental
   health promotion. This study aimed to assess the impact of a school
   based mental health awareness programme aimed at increasing mental
   health literacy and reducing negative views about persons with mental
   illness.
   Methods: A total of 154 secondary school students in Ibadan, southwest
   Nigeria, were allocated into an intervention and a control group.
   Students in the intervention group received a three-hour mental health
   awareness session. All students completed a pre-, immediate post, and
   six month post-intervention questionnaire on their views about mental
   health and illness.
   Results: There was a significant difference in the mean knowledge scores
   between the intervention and the control group post-intervention, but no
   significant differences in attitude and social distance scores.
   Conclusion: Brief training workshops appear able to produce small but
   positive changes in the mental health knowledge of young Nigerians.},

Abstract = {Background: One half of adults who develop any mental disorder do so
   during adolescence. Previous literature showed that Mental Health
   Literacy (MHL) interventions impact mental health knowledge, reduce the
   associated stigma, and promote help-seeking among the adolescent
   population. However, evidence for the effectiveness and
   cost-effectiveness of these programmes remains inconclusive. The aim of
   this paper is to present a study protocol that evaluates the
   effectiveness of the ``EspaiJove.net{''} programme. ``EspaiJove.net{''}
   consists of a universal MHL intervention designed to promote mental
   health knowledge, increase help-seeking, reduce the stigma associated
   with mental illness, and prevent mental disorders in Spanish school
   settings.
   Methods: A school-based clustered randomised controlled trial (cRCT)
   design with 12 months of follow-up.
   Subjects: At least 408 secondary school students who attend the 3rd year
   of E.S.O (Compulsory secondary education for 13- to 14-year-olds) will
   be recruited from 8 schools within Barcelona city, Catalonia (Spain).
   Intervention: A dose-response intervention will be delivered with 4
   arms: 1) Sensitivity Programme (SP) in Mental Health (1 h); 2) Mental
   Health Literacy (MHL) Programme (6 h); 3) MHL plus first-person Stigma
   Reduction (MHL + SR) (7 h); 4) Control group: waiting list.
   Primary outcomes: 1) MHL: EspaiJove. net MHL Test (EMHLT); 2) Stigma:
   Reported and Intended Behaviour Scale (RIBS) and Community Attitudes
   toward the Mentally Ill (CAMI). Others outcomes: 1) Acceptability of
   intervention; 2) Mental health symptoms and emotional well-being (SDQ);
   3) States of Change Scale (SCS); 4) Bullying and Cyberbullying; 5)
   Quality of life (EQ-5D); 6) Help seeking and use of treatment; 7) Health
   benefits.
   Discussion: Results would be informative for efforts to prevent mental
   disorders and promote mental wellbeing in secondary school students.},

Abstract = {This pilot study assessed the acceptability and feasibility of the
   PROviding ACcess To InnoVative \& EvidenceBased Intervention (PROACTIVE)
   Family Navigator Program for foster parents of children with mental
   health needs. Foster parents (n = 7) participated in four video
   conference sessions with a family navigator over the course of one
   month. In this study, family navigators were psychology doctoral
   students with mental health training. Feasibility and acceptability were
   measured with post-session surveys completed by family navigators and
   participants as well as a participant-completed survey following
   completion of the program. Feasibility and acceptability were both found
   to be excellent. Foster parents provided very positive satisfaction
   ratings for all aspects of the program. This pilot study provided
   preliminary support for the feasibility and acceptability of the
   PROACTIVE Family Navigator Program. With the experienced gained in this
   pilot work, we will design a randomized controlled trial with a fully
   powered sample to evaluate the efficacy of this program on building
   foster parent capacity to manage their child's mental health needs.},

Title = {Prevention of mental health issues in the young: A randomised controlled
   evaluation of an e-mental health application for young adults to enhance
   mental health literacy},
Journal = {INTERNET INTERVENTIONS-THE APPLICATION OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN
   MENTAL AND BEHAVIOURAL HEALTH},
Year = {2025},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: The mental health of young adults is deteriorating. Reasons
   for this are manifold, ranging from biological factors (e.g. entering a
   vulnerable developmental phase) to crisis-related external events (e.g.
   COVID19 pandemic). Accordingly, easily accessible and universal
   prevention for the young is needed. Mobile Health (mHealth)
   interventions are on the rise and especially promising for this age
   group, due to numerous benefits, such as low threshold, temporal and
   local flexibility and high scalability. However, the effectiveness and
   acceptance of mHealth interventions as prevention measures are missing
   empirical evidence. Method: In a two-arm randomised controlled trial
   design, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a mental
   health app, the `Mental Health Guide', primarily on mental health
   literacy as well as secondary mental health outcomes. N = 322
   Participants (81.99 \% female, M = 25.55 years, SD = 9.63 years, age
   range: 15 to 59 years) were either assigned to the intervention group (n
   = 158), using the Mental Health Guide for 12 weeks, or the wait-list
   control group (n = 164). Results: The results show a significant
   intervention effect on mental health literacy for the intervention group
   in the post assessment (p = .047, d = 0.20), but no at later follow-up
   time points. Further variables related to mental health indicate various
   effects, such as improved problematic (p = .018, d = 0.20) and prosocial
   behaviour (p = .008, d = 0.23) in the intervention group and improved
   emotion regulation capacities for both groups (p < .001, d = 0.20).
   Overall, there was a high drop-out rate in the study (up to 80 \%),
   especially in the intervention group. Conclusion: This study contributes
   valuable insights into the potential effectiveness of mHealth prevention
   in young adults and gives insights on how such applications are used
   under very naturalistic settings, laying a foundation for future
   research in this field. However, generalisability is limited due to
   selective sample characteristics and a rather high drop-out rate over
   time.},

Abstract = {Although mental health concerns are common among children and
   adolescents, youth-serving adults often feel underprepared in responding
   to these challenges. Youth Mental Health First Aid (YMHFA) is a training
   program designed to teach adults how to assist youths experiencing
   mental health or addiction challenges. This pilot program evaluation
   study examined the outcomes of YMHFA associated with adult knowledge,
   confidence, beliefs, and behaviors. Participants included 2,180
   individuals in Ohio who attended a YMHFA training between January 2015
   and August 2016; most participants were White women and represented
   professions in the field of education. Results revealed that YMHFA
   participants became more confident, willing to help, aware of support
   and resources, and accepting of individuals with mental health
   conditions three months posttraining. A high percentage of YMHFA
   participants also reported applying YMHFA Action Steps at 3, 6, 9, and
   12 months after the training. Demographic differences (by race, gender,
   age, and occupation) in the adult outcomes associated with YMHFA
   training did not emerge when removing the effects of other participant
   variables. Limitations, future directions for research, and implications
   for school psychology practice are discussed in this Service Delivery

Abstract = {Mental health literacy appears to be an important target for prevention
   and intervention efforts. However, limitations exist in this literature
   base, including the lack of a validated measure to assess this
   construct. The Adolescent Depression Knowledge Questionnaire (ADKQ) was
   created to assess knowledge of depression and attitudes about seeking
   help (i.e., depression literacy) for mental health issues before and
   after introduction of a universal, school-based intervention, the
   Adolescent Depression Awareness Program (ADAP). The ADKQ measured
   depression knowledge and attitudes in 8,216 high school students
   immediately before ADAP was implemented and 6 weeks after. The latent
   structure of the Knowledge section was examined with attention to
   measurement invariance between males and females and type of instructor,
   as well as pre- to post-test. Categories were developed for the
   open-ended questions of the Attitudes section. A one-factor (General
   Knowledge) latent structure was the best fit to the data. The latent
   structure of the ADKQ did not differ by student's gender or type of
   instructor, nor did it differ based on pre- or post-test. Categories for
   the Attitudes portion of the ADKQ were developed. Psychometric evidence
   supports the ADKQ as a measure to evaluate adolescent depression
   literacy pre- to post-test and within several groups of interest (e.g.,
   gender, facilitator). Categories for the Attitudes section of the ADKQ
   will allow for easier evaluation of this measure with quantitative data.},

Abstract = {Colleges and universities are the educational institutions of training
   young students. The reform of the modern higher education system
   requires the personnel training in colleges and universities to lay a
   stress on the diversified development, so that the traditional single
   professional course education can be changed. Mental health has a close
   tie with the personal development trend of each student in colleges and
   universities, and also developing mental health education is one of the
   most important parts in higher education. For a long time, colleges and
   universities always adhere to the personnel-based educational idea and
   attach high importance to the work of professional course education, but
   fail to provide enough importance for guiding the detailed mental health
   of students. Thus, the mental health education in colleges and
   universities is misunderstood in many aspects, and this is studied in
   this paper.},

Abstract = {Aim: This study aimed to assess pediatricians' knowledge and awareness
   levels on mental health literacy (MHL) and investigate the factors
   affecting this level.
   Material and Methods: This study was designed as a cross-sectional
   self-report questionnaire-based internet study conducted on 01
   February-25 February 2021. The population of the study consisted of
   pediatricians. The data were collected using questionnaires sent to
   volunteer physicians' smartphones. Participants filled in the
   sociodemographic data and the MHL Scale.
   Results: The data of 140 participants were analyzed in the study. The
   participants' mean age was 37.7 years, and 62.1\% were females, 73.6\%
   were married, and 75.0\% were working as specialists. Considering index
   scores, 15\% of the participants were observed to have insufficient MHL.
   Participation in training on child psychiatry (OR:7.5) predicted
   excellent MHL, while increased years of professional experience were
   observed to the predictor of insufficient MHL (OR:0.9 per year).
   Discussion: This study has investigated the knowledge levels and beliefs
   of pediatricians about mental health disorders and the important part of
   pediatricians have been observed to have insufficient MHL. The results
   have shown that organizing training and meetings in specialty training
   and intermittently afterward to improve MHL will be beneficial for
   pediatricians in recognizing and managing groups with mental illness.},

Abstract = {AimsThis study aims to identify factors associated with mental health
   literacy (mental health knowledge and attitudes towards mental health
   and help-seeking behaviours), depression and anxiety amongst
   adolescents, and test the hypothesised model by examining the
   interrelationships between these outcomes.DesignCross-sectional
   descriptive quantitative research.MethodsUsing convenient sampling, 615
   adolescents from four public schools completed online questionnaires
   measuring mental health literacy, depression, and anxiety. The data were
   analysed using Pearson correlation, multiple linear regression, and
   structural equation modelling (SEM).ResultsIndividual factors (e.g.,
   gender, physical health and past traumatic experiences), family factors
   (e.g., parental criticism and family support) and school/community
   factors (e.g., academic pressure and safety) were associated with mental
   health outcomes. SEM revealed an association between higher mental
   health knowledge and better attitudes towards mental health and
   help-seeking behaviours but did not show a significant association with
   depression and anxiety.ConclusionsFindings emphasise the need for
   holistic and culturally safe approaches to address adolescent mental
   health in Indonesia.ImplicationsFuture research should focus on
   developing and evaluating tailored mental health interventions in
   Indonesia that address individual, family, school, and community
   factors. These interventions should target the interrelated aspects of
   mental health literacy, depression, and anxiety identified in this
   study. Key areas for intervention include enhancing self-esteem,
   promoting help-seeking behaviours, supporting spirituality, managing
   long-term conditions, improving sleep hygiene, encouraging physical
   activity, teaching stress management techniques, fostering diversity,
   managing trauma, and combating discrimination. A comprehensive approach
   to adolescent mental well-being should integrate parental involvement,
   peer support systems, community engagement initiatives, and mental
   health literacy education.ImpactThis research informs future
   interventions such as school-based programs, family-oriented campaigns,
   and community initiatives to support adolescent mental health,
   potentially influencing policy decisions, and resource allocation in
   mental health services.Reporting MethodSTROBE guidelines.Patient or

Title = {Development and psychometric properties of the Knowledge and Attitudes
   to Mental Health Scales (KAMHS): a psychometric measure of mental health
   literacy in children and adolescents},
Journal = {BMC PEDIATRICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 13},
Abstract = {Background Adolescence is a crucial period for the acquisition of good
   mental health behaviours, which are the foundation for health and
   wellbeing in later life. Improved knowledge about mental health and
   improved help-seeking behaviours have been shown to lead to better
   mental health outcomes. Mental health literacy (MHL) is multifaceted
   (e.g., knowledge about symptoms, the stigma around mental health, good
   mental health practices, etc.). Measures are needed that can assess
   these different aspects of MHL. Measurement of mental health literacy is
   currently limited due to a lack of reported psychometric instruments
   with known psychometric properties. Given that most mental health
   problems start in early adolescence, a scale is needed that is reliable
   and valid in this age group. Methods The development and validation of
   the psychometric instrument (termed the Knowledge and Attitudes to
   Mental Health Scales: KAMHS) entailed two phases: 1) item generation
   based on an evidence-based intervention programme: The Guide; and 2)
   item reduction through exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and
   confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) for factor structure and psychometric
   assessment. Participants were 559 Year 9 pupils in secondary schools
   across Wales aged between 13 and 14 years. Results Results from the CFA
   indicated an acceptable fit of the model to the data. The KAMHS showed
   good internal constancy and moderate test-retest validity (.40-.64).
   Conclusions The final version of the KAMHS contains 50 items that are
   appropriate for use in children and adolescents. These results suggest
   that the KAMHS can be used over time to assess the efficacy of
   interventions aimed at increasing the mental health literacy of
   adolescent populations.},

Abstract = {Low mental health literacy and fear of being stigmatized are two main
   barriers that detain adolescents from seeking professional help. An
   information brochure about anxiety disorders for adolescents was
   developed. To make a first statement about the quality of the brochure,
   19 experts, consisting of (child and adolescents) psychotherapists,
   psychiatrists, and psychologists, rated a first version of the brochure
   regarding content validity and age-appropriatness. To evaluate the
   efficacy in knowledge and the acceptance of the brochure, a revised
   version was evaluated by N = 174 adolscents (106 female-, 66 male- and
   two non-binary) between 14 and 17 years of age (M = 16.56 years.; SD =
   0.57). The experts' approval of all content items totals a mean average
   of 95.2 \% (range: 84.2-100 \%). In the adolescent sample, the
   intervention increased knowledge about anxiety disorders (d = 1.04) and
   improved attitudes about coping strategies (d = 0.99). Results of the
   experts' rating showed that content validity of the brochure can be
   assumed. The revised brochure seems to be a useful and effective tool to
   inform adolescents about anxiety disorders.},

Abstract = {Potentially traumatic events (PTEs) are prevalent among Indonesian
   students. Web-based psychoeducation might increase mental health
   literacy and reduce barriers to healthcare access. We developed Pulihkan
   Luka (PL), a web-based psychoeducation programme for Indonesian
   undergraduate students. This pilot randomized controlled trial assessed
   the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of PL. Students
   (N = 130) were randomly assigned to (1) four to seven sessions of PL +
   Enhanced Usual Care (PL+EUC; n = 64) or (2) EUC only (n = 66). EUC
   included a leaflet with referral options to available (mental) health
   services. Participants received baseline, post-intervention, three- and
   six-month follow-up assessments. Twenty participants from the treatment
   group were invited to participate in a focus group discussion. The
   feasibility and acceptability of PL were examined as primary outcomes
   based on module completion, MT4C-in-Care feasibility survey, IIAQ-ID,
   and SIN-E-Stress user satisfaction survey. Secondary outcomes included
   mental health literacy (MHL questionnaire), psychological well-being
   (WHO-5), help-seeking intention (GHSQ), symptoms of PTSD (PCL-5),
   depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), and insomnia (ISI). The results
   indicated a high acceptability of PL (90.63\% willing to use the
   intervention and 89.06\% satisfied with the intervention). The uptake
   and adherence to the intervention were high, with 92.18\% completing the
   first module and 75\% completing all assigned modules. However, the
   feasibility was somewhat lower (59.38\% reported sufficient energy and
   time to complete the modules). The PL+EUC group improved significantly
   more in mental health literacy compared to EUC only from baseline to
   post-intervention (b = -0.99, t(140) = 3.64, p = .02). The PL+EUC group
   did not improve more in psychological well-being and help-seeking
   intentions, PTSD, depression, anxiety, and insomnia compared to EUC
   only. PL is the first web-based trauma psychoeducation programme in
   Indonesia, and it was found to be feasible and acceptable for Indonesian
   undergraduate students, as well as to improve mental health literacy.

   speech data. The model achieves an average recognition accuracy of
   87.21\% on the RAVDESS speech emotion corpus, showing particular
   strengths in detecting emotions like happiness and boredom. The findings
   suggest that this technology can be effectively employed to gauge

Title = {Sources of stress and coping strategies among Chinese medical graduate
   students: a qualitative study},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN 5},
Abstract = {BackgroundThe incidence of mental health problems among medical graduate
   students is much higher than among students of other disciplines. This
   can have adverse consequences for the medical students themselves as
   well as their future patients. This study aims to understand the
   pressures faced by Chinese medical students and the current status of
   mental health education. It also propose recommendations for the current
   situation and prospects for the future.MethodThe authors conducted
   in-depth semi-structured interviews with 22 master's students from five
   medical schools during November 2023. All interview sessions were
   recorded and transcribed verbatim. The transcriptions were analyzed
   using the Colaizzi's seven-step method.ResultThree main themes were
   extracted from the students' statements: sources of psychological
   stress, ways to cope with stress, and perspectives on mental health
   education. The study showed that current mental health education in
   China is mostly in the form of printed mental health education manuals
   and mental health lectures, and there is no active tiered intervention
   for students at different levels. It is suggested that reforms should be
   made to shift to a model where the school proactively identifies
   problems and intervenes based on feedback.ConclusionThis study reveals
   the widespread psychological stress and shortcomings in current
   education methods. To address these challenges, institutions should
   develop tailored interventions, including tiered support systems, open
   dialogue promotion, and resilience training. Future research should
   focus on evaluating innovative interventions' effectiveness, ultimately
   fostering a supportive environment that enhances students' success and
   contributes to a healthier healthcare workforce.},

Title = {Adolescent Mental Health Literacy Questionnaire: Investigating
   Psychometric Properties in Iranian Female Students},
Journal = {BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {MAY 18},
Abstract = {Objectives. Mental Health Literacy (MHL) is an important factor in
   promoting mental health. Assessing this structure is required for early
   recognition and intervention in mental health problems. To date, there
   was no tool to assess it among Iranian adolescents, so this study was
   aimed at examining the psychometric properties of the Persian version of
   the Adolescent Mental Health Literacy Questionnaire (AMHLQ) among
   Iranian female students. Method. The study instrument was a Persian
   version of the AMHLQ prepared through a translation and back-translation
   process. In this cross-sectional study, 275 female students completed
   the AMHLQ, and the Adolescent Strengths, and Difficulties Questionnaire
   (SDQ). Results. Findings of content, construct validity tests,
   Cronbach's alpha, and split-half coefficient demonstrated that the AMHLQ
   had satisfactory validity and suitable reliability. The exploratory
   factor analysis showed four dimensions of the AMHLQ: (1) knowledge of
   mental health problems (alpha=0.89); (2) erroneous beliefs/stereotypes
   (alpha=0.89); (3) help-seeking and first aid skills (alpha=0.86); and
   (4) self-help strategies (alpha=0.74). Conclusion. The findings showed
   that the tool was confirmed by questions and subscales, and this
   questionnaire was a valid and reliable tool in assessing level
   differences of MHL and in determining the impact of programs designed to
   improve MHL in Iranian female adolescents.},

   maintaining adolescent mental health. This quantitative study used a
   quasi-experiment method, pre-and post-testing with a control group
   design. A total of 86 adolescents were selected using the purposive
   sampling method and allocated into two groups that were administered
   different types of intervention. The first intervention group was
   provided with mental health education and adolescent developmental
   stimulation only, which was carried out with individual exercises of
   stimulation. The second intervention group was provided with mental
   health education and adolescent developmental stimulation in addition to
   CBGT and FPE. A mental health continuum short-form questionnaire was
   used to determine mental health scores. The results showed that most of
   the adolescents received flourishing mental health scores. These scores
   significantly increased after receiving mental health education and
   developmental stimulation, as well as CBGT and FPE. Our results indicate
   that mental health education and developmental stimulation can be used
   to promote and maintain good mental health. CBGT and FPE can be used not

Title = {Assessing Mental Health Literacy Among Undergraduate Nursing Students in
   South Africa},
Journal = {NURSING REPORTS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {15},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Background: Amidst a growing shortage of human resources for mental
   health, concerns persist over the mental health literacy (MHL) and
   readiness of nursing students to fulfil their future role as
   non-specialist mental healthcare providers. Methods: A cross-sectional
   study was conducted to assess the MHL among nursing students enrolled in
   a four-year nursing programme using the Mental Health Literacy Scale
   (MHLS) adapted and validated for primary health care workers in the
   South African context. Multiple regression analysis was used to
   determine the factors influencing MHL among the nursing students.
   Results: Only a third of the 220 respondents (n = 73; 33.2\%) expressed
   interest in specialising in mental health. A one-way ANOVA revealed
   statistically significant differences in the MHLS scores across year
   levels, F(3, 216) = 3.225, p = 0.023, though Tukey post hoc analysis
   found no significant difference between second-year students (with
   mental health theory only) and third-/fourth-years (with both
   theoretical and clinical exposure, p = 0.295). Year of study, family
   history of mental illness, and career aspirations in mental health were
   significant predictors of MHL. While gender initially appeared
   significant, a sensitivity analysis suggested that this result may not
   be robust due to the small number of male participants. Conclusions: The
   absence of a significant difference in MHL among nursing students across
   years of study suggests limitations in how the nursing training
   programme integrates mental health theory with clinical practice.
   Nursing education stakeholders should review curricula and teaching
   strategies to ensure that MHL is effectively reinforced throughout
   training.},

Title = {Healthy Minds: A School-Based Prevention Programme for Deliberate
   Self-harm in Adolescence},
Journal = {SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {701-714},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In recent years, there has been a notable increase in the prevalence of
   deliberate self-harm (DSH) among adolescents, which has led to the
   recognition of this issue as a significant public health challenge.
   However, school-based prevention programmes for DSH remain scarce. This
   study aimed to develop, implement, and evaluate the effectiveness of the
   Healthy Minds programme, a universal school-based prevention
   intervention targeting DSH in adolescents. Conducted in a Lisbon school,
   the programme sought to reduce DSH and suicidal ideation, change beliefs
   about DSH, and promote help-seeking. A quasi-experimental design with
   experimental and control groups included 137 participants aged 13-19 (M
   = 14.73; SD = 1.03), assessed at three time points: pre-intervention,
   post-intervention, and follow-up. The intervention showed partial
   effectiveness, with delayed reductions in DSH and significant
   improvements in reducing false beliefs. In addition, both groups showed
   increased help-seeking behaviours, and these effects were sustained over
   the follow-up period, suggesting long-term effectiveness. However, no
   significant improvements were observed in the ability to recognise
   warning signs of DSH, nor were there reductions in levels of suicidal
   ideation. The Healthy Minds programme shows promise in reducing DSH,
   improving mental health literacy and promoting help-seeking behaviours
   in adolescents, with sustained benefits observed over time. These
   findings highlight the importance of implementing well-structured,
   methodologically robust school-based interventions aimed at preventing
   DSH in this population. To maximise programme effectiveness, longer
   follow-up periods and more integrated, multifaceted approaches are
   essential.},

Journal = {PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENT \& HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Several evidence-based programs to improve mental health literacy (MHL)
   are available; however, few have been adapted for youth athletes and
   sport-club settings. This systematic review aimed to investigate the
   impact of MHL initiatives, inclusive of education, resources and
   information, on the mental health of youth elite athletes. Studies were
   included if they examined a mental health program for young athletes
   (10-24 years) and reported MHL outcomes in either young people or their
   extended support network. A systematic search of the PubMed, Scopus and
   SPORTDiscus databases was conducted with no language or publication
   restrictions from July 2020 until September 2020. Thirteen studies were
   included for analysis in the review. Six studies included adolescent
   athletes, four studies included parents of adolescent athletes, six
   studies included coaching staff and three studies included female
   athletic populations. Five of these studies were qualitative and eight
   quantitative. The broad study search identified a lack of well designed,
   intervention-based research on MHL programs for youth elite athletes
   despite high demand for context specific programs. No literature that
   met eligibility criteria addressed MHL in youth female elite athletes
   exclusively. These findings limit dissemination and program
   transferability. This study also reinforces the influence parents and
   coaches have on the mental wellbeing of young elite athletes. To enhance
   the quality of MHL initiatives, programs developers should focus on the
   development of tailored resources for youth athletes with a gendered
   focus and incorporating opportunities for coach and parent engagement.},

   completed self-report questionnaires prior to, immediately following,
   and 3 months after completion of a 3-h ED-MHL intervention. Perceived
   psychosocial impairment associated with EDF-binge eating, purging,
   extreme dietary restriction, overvaluation of weight/shape, and
   excessive exercise-was assessed at each time point.
   Results: At all 3 time points, EDF were considered to have a `slightly
   negative' to `very negative' impact on psychosocial functioning. Prior
   to the intervention, binge eating, purging and extreme dietary
   restriction were generally considered to have a greater negative impact
   than excessive exercise and overvaluation of weight/shape. Three months
   after the ED-MHL intervention, participants reported greater perceived
   impairment associated with excessive exercise and overvaluation; while
   perceptions of psychosocial impairment associated with binge eating,
   purging and dietary restriction remained largely unchanged. Females
   perceived greater impairment associated with EDF than males did
   immediately after the intervention, but not at the 3-month follow-up.
   Conclusions: The adverse effects on psychosocial functioning of binge
   eating, purging and extreme dietary restriction appear to be readily
   recognized by young people. Awareness of the adverse effects of
   excessive exercise and overvaluation may be poorer, but amenable to
   improvement by means of a relatively simple intervention. These features
   may warrant particular attention in health promotion programs.},

Title = {Perceptions of mental health literacy, stigma, empathy, and confidence
   in managing patients with psychiatric disorders among doctors and nurses
   working in a Singapore emergency department},
Journal = {BMC EMERGENCY MEDICINE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {25},

Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {In line with the global rise in mental health disorders, Singapore has
   experienced a notable increase in prevalence, from 13.4\% in 2020 to
   17\% in 2022. Despite strategic efforts to strengthen mental health
   services, such as expanding the workforce of psychiatrists and
   psychologists and integrating care into primary healthcare settings, the
   Emergency Department (ED) faces escalating numbers of patients with
   psychiatric disorders. This surge leads to heightened workloads, stress,
   and burnout among healthcare professionals. This study explores the
   perceptions of mental health literacy, stigma, empathy, and confidence
   in managing patients with psychiatric disorders among doctors and nurses
   working in Singapore's EDs. Questionnaires used include the Mental
   Health Literacy Scale (MHLS) to assess mental health literacy, the
   Opening Minds Scale for Health Care Providers-15 (OMS-HC-15) to measure
   attitudes toward mental illness, and the Jefferson Scale of Empathy
   (JSE) to measure empathy. In the last quarter of 2021, 47 doctors and 63
   nurses from the ED at a general restructured hospital in Singapore, who
   had worked for at least 4 months in the ED, completed the survey. The
   anonymous survey included the above-validated questionnaires and two
   original questionnaires that assessed confidence in managing patients
   with psychiatric disorders and their familiarity with the local Mental
   Health Care and Treatment Act (MHCTA). Differences between doctors and
   nurses for all categorical variables, including demographic data and the
   questionnaire responses of interest, were analysed. Findings reveal that
   doctors scored higher in mental health literacy (MHLS score of 121.89 to
   118.27) and empathy (JSE score of 109.32 to 101.44) and lower in stigma
   than nurses (OMS-HC-15 score of 41.98 to 43.57). Furthermore,
   Singaporean ED professionals scored lower on these dimensions than their
   counterparts in Western countries but outperformed those in East Asia.
   The unique roles of doctors and nurses, coupled with Singapore's
   distinct sociocultural context, likely contribute to these variations.
   Both groups demonstrated moderate confidence in handling patients with
   psychiatric disorders but emphasised the need for further training.
   These insights underscore the importance of implementing systemic
   policies and targeted training programmes to improve mental health care,
   reduce stigma, and enhance empathy and confidence among ED
   professionals.},

Abstract = {Reviews into universal interventions to improve help seeking in young
   people focus on specific concepts, such as behaviour, do not
   differentiate between interpersonal and intrapersonal help seeking, and
   often report on statistical significance, rather than effect size. The
   aim of this review was to address the gaps highlighted above, to
   investigate the impact of universal, school-based interventions on
   help-seeking in children and young people, as well as to explore longer
   term impact. Four databases were searched. Data were extracted on
   country of origin, design, participant, school, and intervention
   characteristics, the help-seeking concept measured (e.g. knowledge,
   attitude/intention, behaviour), the duration between baseline and each
   follow-up (if applicable) and effect sizes at each follow-up. Quality
   assessment of the studies was undertaken using the Effective Public
   Health Practice Project (EPHPP) quality assessment tool. Overall, 14
   different interventions met inclusion criteria. The majority of the
   studies were rated low in the quality assessment. Three constructs were
   most frequently reported a) intrapersonal attitudes towards
   help-seeking, b) interpersonal attitudes towards help-seeking and c)
   intrapersonal intended help-seeking. Findings around intervention effect
   were mixed. There was tentative evidence that interventions impacting
   interpersonal attitudes produced small effect sizes when measured
   between 3 and 6 months post intervention and that when effect sizes were
   initially observed intrapersonal attitudes, this remained at 3-6 month
   follow-up. Further work should pay attention to implementation factors,
   understanding the core ingredients needed to deliver effective
   interventions and whether embedding mental health education could help
   sustain or top up effect sizes from help-seeking interventions.},

Abstract = {Objective This study examined the eating disorder mental health literacy
   of psychiatrists. Method A sample of psychiatrists completed a
   questionnaire measuring knowledge of and attitudes towards eating
   disorders. Knowledge questions were based on the academic literature,
   standard diagnostic criteria and national guidelines on the management
   of eating disorders. Attitude items covered beliefs about the aetiology
   and treatment of eating disorders, confidence levels in diagnosis and
   management and the use of compulsory measures in anorexia nervosa.
   Results Psychiatrists' knowledge of eating disorders was variable with
   specific gaps in both diagnosis and management. Psychiatrists felt more
   confident in diagnosing eating disorders than managing these conditions.
   Attitudes towards eating disorders were less stigmatizing than those
   seen in other health professionals. Discussion There is a clear need for
   greater education of psychiatrists regarding the diagnosis and
   management of eating disorders. Implementing training programmes and
   making information readily available could contribute to addressing
   these issues. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd and Eating

Abstract = {Research shows the important role of parents' mental health literacy in
   detecting depressive symptoms and supporting their children to seek
   professional help. Improving mental health literacy in parents has
   recently gained even greater importance due to the negative impact of
   the COVID-19 pandemic on children and adolescents' mental health. The
   aim of the present experimental pre-post-follow-up study was to examine
   knowledge change after the reception of contents from an innovative
   web-based platform (www.ich-bin-alles.de/eltern) containing
   evidence-based information on youth depression and mental health in
   parents of adolescents with a history of depression. A second aim was to
   assess evaluation of the layout and the acceptance of the platform. N =
   33 parents of adolescents with a history of depression (either current
   or remitted depression) were presented different content domains of the
   website. Participants' knowledge about depression was assessed at pre-
   and post-intervention, and at a four week follow-up. Moreover, parents
   evaluated the acceptance and the layout of the website. The trial was
   preregistered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05335564). The results showed a
   significant increase in total knowledge from pre to post, which remained
   stable over the course of four weeks. Explorative analyses showed that
   sociodemographic variables did not influence the extent of knowledge
   gain. Acceptance rates were high and evaluations of the website's layout
   were positive. The findings show that the web-based information portal
   is a promising and appealing means to increase parental knowledge on
   youth depression. Low-threshold psychoeducational approaches like
   websites are particularly relevant in times of crisis and increased
   prevalence rates of depressive symptoms and disorders (ehealth). These
   results are an important basis for future studies as well as approaches
   that aim to impart knowledge about mental disorders like youth
   depression via web-based means. Furthermore, they bear implications for
   policy decisions concerning mental health education and campaigns.},

Abstract = {Objective:
   This review of online mental health resources was conducted to evaluate
   and document the availability of mental health resources pertinent to
   the needs of children of parents with a mental illness (COPMI). This
   review identified available websites and analyzed the appropriateness of
   content and readability.
   Methods:
   We conducted an extensive 6-month review of websites with available
   mental health literacy content that may be found by COPMI searching for
   information. Web content was evaluated and described with qualitative
   thematic analysis techniques. Web content was also evaluated for reading
   levels using the Flesch-Kincaid readability analysis tool.
   Results:
   The researchers described 7 descriptive themes, 10 content areas, and
   described what information was available across websites and where gaps
   existed. They also concluded the average reading level of the websites
   was 9.7, which was substantially higher than current web development
   recommendations.
   Conclusions:
   Websites can be a valuable tool for COPMI without access to direct
   services. To improve current web resources, developers should strive to
   offer content specific to the identified needs of COPMI. Additionally,
   web content should be developed at a level that is accessible to teens
   and parents.},

Abstract = {A healthy psychological state is the premise for children to carry out
   various activities. Previous surveys have shown that children with
   special needs are affected by their own obstacles and are more prone to
   psychological problems such as sensitivity, low self-esteem, and
   impulsiveness. Therefore, it is necessary to provide more systematic
   mental health education support for special children. Mental health
   education programs are an efficient form of maintaining children's
   mental health. However, in the field of special education, the number of
   mental health education courses developed according to the physical and
   mental characteristics and developmental needs of special children is
   relatively small, and there are many difficulties in the implementation
   process. Autism disorder (ASD) is a kind of pervasive developmental
   dysfunction that is relatively common and representative in clinical
   practice. In recent years, the number of autistic children has continued
   to surge, and has gradually expanded from a family problem to a serious
   social problem. At present, the evaluation of the effect of autism
   intervention mainly relies on various behavioral scales, which are
   subjective to a certain extent. At the same time, due to the unclear
   pathogenesis of autism, the treatment of autism cannot be predicated on
   the right medicine, and can only be intervened in various ways. The
   purpose of this paper is to explore the difference between the EEG
   signals of autistic children and typically developing control (TD)
   children through the analysis method of EEG signals, and based on the
   analysis of EEG signals from an objective point of view, to study
   whether the music therapy method of Chinese Zither playing training can
   effectively Improving the brain functional status of children with
   autism yields positive therapeutic outcomes. The experimental results
   show that the complexity of brain electrical signals of ASD children is
   much lower than that of TD children, and there is a significant
   difference in the brain functional state between the two. The music
   therapy method based on Chinese zither playing training can improve the
   brain function of autistic patients, and there is a positive therapeutic
   effect. And with the extension of the training period, the effect may be
   more significant. Chinese zither playing training can provide a new
   direction for the intervention of autism.},

Title = {Attitude Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help Among
   Community-Dwelling Population in China},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Month = {MAY 14},
Abstract = {Objective To explore the attitudes and factors in seeking professional
   psychological help among a Chinese community-dwelling population in
   order to promote positive help-seeking behaviors and better utilization
   of mental health services. Methods Using system and simple random
   sampling with Kish selection table methods, 912 community-dwelling
   residents were included in this study and asked about their attitudes
   toward seeking professional psychological help, depression symptoms,
   family function, depression literacy, help-seeking intention, and
   stigma. Results Scores on the Attitudes Toward Seeking Professional
   Psychological Help scale (ATSPPH-SF) indicated a neutral attitude toward
   openness to seeking treatment for psychological problems and a negative
   attitude toward the value and need to seek treatment with a negative
   total score. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that gender,
   age, social support (employment status and family function), depression
   literacy, stigma, and help-seeking intention are significantly
   associated with attitude toward seeking professional psychological help.
   Conclusion The overall attitude toward seeking professional
   psychological help is not optimistic, thus, more efforts are needed to
   enhance understanding. Effective interventions including mental health
   education, training of mental health professionals, and popularizing the
   use of mental health services are essential, especially for the at-risk
   population.},

Title = {Meaning mindset theory: a transdiagnostic approach to mental health
   promotion and intervention for children},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {15},
Month = {JAN 24},
Abstract = {A transdiagnostic approach is increasingly recognized as crucial in the
   prevention or treatment of child internalizing and externalizing mental
   health concerns. There is substantial overlap and comorbidity among
   various mental health concerns and the onset of one mental illness
   elevates the risk of others, underscoring the potential limitations of
   singular-focused mental health education or treatment. Meaning Mindset
   Theory (MMT) is a transdiagnostic framework developed and evaluated over
   the past decade in Canada as a promising new approach. MMT emphasizes
   agency over thoughts and behaviors, empathy and social competence
   skills, and meaningful engagement to enhance resilience for both
   internalizing and externalizing symptoms. The DREAM Program-Developing
   Resilience through Emotions, Attitudes, and Meaning is a mental health
   education program grounded in MMT principles. This program has enhanced
   meaning mindset-agency over thoughts and behaviors, hope for a future
   that is good, positive self-concept, and openness to learning, new
   experiences, and feelings-as well as both internalizing and
   externalizing mental health. To date, the DREAM program, as well as MMT
   more broadly, has been tested in diverse populations with school-aged
   children, families, neurodiverse and intellectually gifted young people,
   homeless men, and Black families, among others. Future research should
   explore the efficacy of an MMT in therapeutic settings compared to
   standard treatments, potentially enhancing mental health intervention
   strategies for Canadian children and families.},

Title = {Mental health literacy: knowledge of depression among undergraduate
   students in Hanoi, Vietnam},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {12},
Month = {APR 24},
Abstract = {Background: Mental health literacy (MHL) refers to an individuals'
   knowledge and beliefs about mental disorders that aid their recognition,
   management, and prevention. This study aims to investigate the MHL of
   depression among public health and sociology undergraduate students in
   Hanoi, Vietnam.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was carried out from May to September
   2015. Data was collected using an anonymous, self-administered
   questionnaire distributed to 350 undergraduate students (213 public
   health majors; 137 sociology majors). Questions about MHL of depression
   were adapted from the Australian National Survey of Mental Health
   Literacy and Stigma. Question topics included recognition of depression,
   help-seeking intentions, first-aid support, and knowledge about
   interventions to help people with depression. Chi squared tests were
   conducted to compare proportional statistics across groups for multiple
   measures.
   Results: With regard to recognition of mental disorders, 32.0\% of the
   respondents used the accurate label ``depression{''} for the vignette.
   Among those who correctly identified depression, 82.1\% would seek help.
   The corresponding statistic was 81.1\% from those who did not recognize
   depression. Both groups would seek help from counselor, psychologist,
   family members, and close friends. First-aid support suggested by the
   respondents in both groups were informal sources (to listen to her
   problem in an understanding way, to encourage her to be more physically
   active, etc.). The interventions considered most helpful by the
   respondents were self-help strategies such as learning how to relax,
   getting physically active, doing exercise early in the morning, and
   reading a self-help book. Joining a group of individuals with similar
   problems was chosen to be a helpful intervention among those who did not
   recognize depression (p < 0.001), but those who correctly identify
   depression believed that people with depression should be admitted to
   hospital for psychiatric treatment (p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: There is a need for education about MHL of depression among
   undergraduate students in Vietnam. The training can focus on symptoms of
   depression, appropriate help-seeking intentions, and first-aid support
   relevant to the Vietnamese context.},

Abstract = {This study aims to verify the adolescents ability to correctly identify
   mental health disorders such as depression and the intention to seek
   help, which refers to the determinants of Mental Health Literacy (MHL).
   As well as understanding the relationship between MHL and the
   psychological state associated with depression among adolescents in
   schools. This study was conducted using a cross sectional descriptive
   design and included 450 adolescent students (215 males and 235 females)
   from public intermediate and secondary schools in southern Jordan, and
   they were between 13 and 16 years old from ten randomly selected
   schools. Data on sociodemographic characteristics (gender, age, smoking,
   exposure to bullying, loneliness, parental marital status, and financial
   status represented by parental income) of participating adolescents were
   collected through student data from school principals and then assessed
   by the Global Student Health Survey (GSHS). MHL among adolescents was
   assessed and measured using the depression vignette and questionnaire of
   the mental health literacy and stigma. The data were analyzed using the
   Statistical Program for Social Sciences (SPSS) and multivariate binary
   logistic regression to examine and study the determinants of MHL. The
   results were obtained, the most important of which was that the adequate
   levels of MHL among adolescents were clearly and directly related to
   several factors. This was demonstrated by the use of multivariate
   analysis. The study concluded that the factors that significantly
   affected adequate levels of MHL were gender (females), age (older
   adolescents), non-smoking, and lack of loneliness. Where the values
   related to these factors obtained from multivariate analysis were
   (AOR=1.72; 95\% CI 1.15, 2.57), (AOR=1.52; 95\% CI 1.04, 2.22),
   (AOR=1.60; 95\% CI 1.09, 3.54), (AOR=1.20; 95\% CI 1.12, 1.76),
   respectively. One of the most important recommendations focused in this
   research is to pay attention to addressing the determinants and levels
   of MHL adequate to develop a generation of young adolescents who are
   more aware and free of mental disorders and have high levels of MHL
   adequate. ASEAN Journal of Psychiatry, Vol. 24 (1) January, 2023; 1-15.},

Abstract = {PurposeKorean immigrant families are growing in the Southern United
   States (U.S), an area where culturally specific resources can be
   limited. Korean immigrant families encounter distress in navigating the
   American culture, but cultural stigma impedes discussion within the
   family. An evidence-based mental health awareness program called Youth
   Mental Health First Aid (YMHFA) exists to serve as gatekeeper training
   for lay adults to identify and support youth experiencing mental health
   challenges. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of a culturally
   adapted Korean-YMHFA (K-YMHFA) program among Korean immigrants in the
   Southern U.S.Materials and methodUsing a mixed methods approach, a
   quantitative survey was distributed before and after program completion
   (N = 24), and a follow-up interview following program completion was
   also completed (N = 12). Quantitative analysis conducted a paired sample
   t-test, qualitative analysis conducted directed content analysis, and
   mixed methods analysis developed joint displays.ResultsParticipant's
   mental health literacy, confidence and control in YMHFA skills, and
   positive attitude toward YMHFA skills significantly increased, and
   stigma decreased after the training. Participants also provided
   information on specific steps for increasing cultural relevancy and
   sustainability within the community. Overall, mixed methods analysis
   indicated that the program was feasible in the context of Korean
   immigrants in the Southern U.S.ConclusionDespite the growing Korean
   community, the Southern U.S. has limited Korean ethnic services. With
   the feasibility of K-YMHFA, advocacy in promoting K-YMHFA is needed to
   counteract the limited resources while serving as an early intervention
   for youth and families in distress.},

   from public and independent schools in the Western Cape completed the
   survey.Results: There was a significant difference between first aid
   skills and help-seeking behaviours between the different genders.
   Specifically, girls were more prone to first aid skills and help-seeking
   behaviours than boys and other genders. Boys, on the other hand, were
   significantly more prone to using self-help strategies than girls and
   other genders. While gender differences were evident, these results are
   not sufficient to generalise to the larger population due to the limited
   sample.Conclusion: The results of this study are relevant to
   practitioners who wish to improve MHL and help-seeking behaviours among
   adolescents.},

Abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to examine, using Mental Health
   Literacy, acceptability and correlates of acceptability of three
   treatment interventions for bulimia nervosa; medication, psychological
   therapy and self-change/lifestyle therapies.
   Method: A self-report questionnaire to ascertain correlates of attitudes
   towards the three interventions was used. Respondents (n = 177) were
   females aged 18-53 years.
   Results: Psychological therapy was rated the most acceptable treatment
   to participants as well as the most acceptable to others, and to have
   most advantages and fewest disadvantages, followed by
   self-change/lifestyle therapies, and then medication. Social Pressures
   to be Thin was the most strongly endorsed cause of bulimia, followed by
   Low Self-Esteem, Eating Behaviour, Relationship and Family Environment,
   and lastly, Biology. Correlates with acceptability of different
   treatment approaches were identified.
   Conclusions: Although no causal link can be assumed from this design,
   findings suggest that women appear to have a mixed understanding of the
   different mechanisms that each treatment intervention adopts to treat
   the causes and symptoms of bulimia, particularly self-change/lifestyle
   therapies. This may help to explain poor adherence to interventions.},

Title = {Mental health literacy in adolescents: ability to recognise problems,
   helpful interventions and outcomes},
Journal = {CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY AND MENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {11},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Background: Although mental health literacy has been widely studied in
   adults, there are still relatively few studies on adolescent
   populations. In Sri Lanka, adolescents account for about one fifth of
   the population. Current evidence shows that most mental health problems
   diagnosed in adulthood begin in adolescence. There is also growing
   evidence that the trajectories of these disorders can be altered through
   early recognition and intervention. Although, help-seeking for mental
   health problems is known to be poor in adolescents, mental health
   literacy improves help-seeking. It is also known that adolescents may
   act as agents of change regarding mental health in their wider
   communities. Thus, mental health literacy in adolescents is an important
   aspect of community mental health initiatives. The objective of this
   study was to describe aspects of mental health literacy in terms of
   ability to recognise problems, helpful interventions, helpful referral
   options and outcomes in a target adolescent population in Sri Lanka. The
   association between socio economic variables and recognition of mental
   health problems was also examined.
   Methods: This descriptive cross sectional study used a pretested
   questionnaire on 1002 adolescents aged between 13 and 16, where mental
   health literacy was assessed using 4 case vignettes. The vignettes
   represented depression with suicidal ideation, social phobia, psychosis
   and diabetes, where the last was for comparison.
   Results: The response rates for recognition as a mental health problem
   was 82.2\% (n = 824) for the vignette depicting depression, 68.7\% (n =
   689) for the psychosis vignette and 62.3\% (n = 623) for the social
   phobia vignette. ``Talking to the person{''}, was responded to as
   helpful by 49.9\% (n = 500), for the depression vignette followed by
   49.8\% (n = 499) for social phobia, 39.5\% (n = 396) for psychosis and
   19.5\% (n = 195) for the diabetes vignette. The response rate for
   exercise being a helpful intervention was 25\% (n = 251) for the
   diabetes vignette, followed by 21\% (n = 210) for social phobia, 18.7\%
   (n = 187) for psychosis vignette and 18.4\% (n = 184) for the depression
   vignette. While 70.2\% (n = 704) responded that there would be benefit
   in seeing a doctor for the diabetes vignette, the response rates for
   psychosis was 48.5\% (n = 486), and for both depression and social
   phobia it was 48.2\% (n = 483). The responses for the persons in the
   vignettes becoming better with treatment was 81.4\% (n = 816) for the
   diabetes, 79.5\% (n = 797) for depression, 75.6\% (n = 758) for
   psychosis and 63.4\% (n = 636) for the social phobia vignette. A
   statistically significant association was found between the income level
   of the family and appropriate recognition as mental health problems, for
   all the 3 mental health related vignettes.
   Conclusions: The ability to recognise mental health problems, helpful
   interventions and outcomes in this population was comparable to those of
   adolescent populations in other countries, with some exceptions. The
   main differences were in relation to the identification and
   interventions in response to the psychosis and social phobia vignettes.},

Title = {Effect of MyTeen SMS-Based Mobile Intervention for Parents of
   Adolescents A Randomized Clinical Trial},
Journal = {JAMA NETWORK OPEN},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {2},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {IMPORTANCE There is global pressure to respond to the burden posed by
   adolescent mental health problems. The National Mental Health Commission
   has made a call for investment in mobile health services directed at
   prevention and early intervention to relieve the demand on targeted
   mental health services that are costly to provide. Parents and primary
   caregivers play a significant role in the lives of adolescents and are
   important targets for such efforts. Currently, there is no evidence for
   the effectiveness of programs delivered solely via text message for
   parents of adolescents.
   OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effects of a text-messaging program (MyTeen)
   on promoting parental competence and mental health literacy for parents
   of adolescents.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A parallel 2-group randomized clinical
   trial was conducted in New Zealand. A total of 221 parents and primary
   caregivers of adolescents aged 10 to 15 years were recruited from March
   19 to August 17, 2018, via community outreach and social media and were
   randomly allocated 1: 1 into the control or the intervention group.
   Statistical analysis was performed on the principle of intention to
   treat with adjustment for baseline factors and ethnicity.
   INTERVENTION A text-messaging program for parents of adolescents (age
   10-15 years) to promote parental competence and mental health literacy.
   Participants received 1 daily text message over 4 weeks.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Parental competence, assessed at 1 month
   after randomization by the Parenting Sense of Competence Scale.
   RESULTS In total, 221 participants (214 {[}96.8\%] female) were
   randomized, 109 to the intervention group and 112 to the control group;
   201 participants (91\%) completed the trial at 3 months. Significant
   group difference was observed on the primary outcome at the end of 1
   month of intervention, with participants reporting a higher level of
   parental competence than those in the control group (estimated mean
   difference, 3.33 points; 95\% CI, 1.37-5.29 points; P=.002). Except for
   knowledge about mental health, all secondary outcomes were significant,
   including continued improvement in parental competence at 3 months
   (estimated mean difference, 4.08 points; 95\% CI, 1.96-6.20 points;
   P<.001), knowledge of help seeking (estimated mean difference, 0.99
   points; 95\% CI, 0.49-1.50 points; P<.001), parental distress (estimated
   mean difference, -2.39 points; 95\% CI, -4.37 to -0.40 points; P=.02),
   and parent-adolescent communication (estimated mean difference, 2.21
   points; 95\% CI, 0.48-3.95 points; P=.01), with participants in the
   intervention group reporting better parenting-related outcomes than the
   control group at 1 and 3 months after the intervention.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This text-messaging program for parents of
   adolescents appears to be an effective and feasible way to facilitate
   the implementation and delivery of evidence-based information to
   populations that are not easily reached with other intervention
   modalities. The program can be easily scaled up for delivery as an early
   preventive intervention and may represent a less expensive option for
   service delivery.},

Abstract = {Background: Youth in vulnerable situations are known to have high rates
   of mental disorders but low help-seeking. Help-seeking is known to be
   influenced by mental health literacy (MHL), a key concept that is
   important for the recognition of mental disorders and planning
   intervention. Aims: To explore MHL and help-seeking patterns in a group
   of young women in an urban slum setting in India. Materials and Methods:
   A total of 337 young women between 16 and 19 years of age belonging to
   urban slum settings formed the study sample. Two vignettes on depression
   and self-harm were used to assess: (a) recognition of the disorder, (b)
   help-seeking, and (c) knowledge of treatments available. Results: Only
   8\% of women were able to label the condition as depression in the first
   vignette. Though suicidality was identified correctly by the majority of
   participants 73 (63\%), they did not think it needed urgent
   intervention. Only a few considered mental health professionals as
   possible sources of help (19.3\% for depression and 2.4\% for
   self-harm). Majority of the young women felt friends and parents were
   sources of help, and that stigma and lack of awareness were the reasons
   for not considering professional help. Conclusion: MHL regarding
   depression and suicidality is low among young women from low-income
   areas. It is a critical and urgent need to encourage early and
   appropriate help-seeking for mental health problems in this vulnerable
   population.},

Abstract = {Aims: On the Edge is a mental health education programme designed to
   support early intervention by increasing knowledge and understanding of
   early psychosis, reducing the stigma associated with mental health
   issues and improving awareness of avenues of help. The target audience
   was young people aged 14-22 years in schools and colleges.
   Methods: An interactive drama programme was developed through
   collaborative working across psychiatry, applied drama and those with
   direct experience of psychosis. A national tour engaged 2500 students in
   71 performances that took place in 51 schools and colleges. The
   programme was evaluated against its aims with data collected both during
   and after the tour.
   Results: Quantitative and qualitative evaluation found significant gains
   with respect to all three aims. Thirty-one schools developed supportive
   links with local mental health services.
   Conclusions: This programme shows the value and effectiveness of
   delivering health education on early psychosis through the medium of
   applied drama, and offers a model for a programme that can be
   incorporated into early intervention services. Lessons learned through
   delivering this programme are a valuable contribution towards future
   developments of mental health education programmes for schools.},

Title = {Impacts of adolescent participation in a mental health education,
   leadership, and advocacy program (the Live4Life Crew) on outcomes after
   leaving secondary school in Victoria, Australia: A qualitative study},
Journal = {SSM-MENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background: A key component of the Live4Life program, run by
   not-for-profit entity Youth Live4Life, is a `Crew' of youth mental
   health ambassadors aged 14-16 years who undergo a mental health
   education, leadership, and advocacy program. Building on past
   evaluations, this study explores the impacts of Live4LifeCrew
   participation on their lives after leaving secondary school. Objective:
   This study describes the impacts of Crew participation on alumni's
   health, wellbeing, education, employment, and skill development after
   leaving secondary school, and to explore the drivers of these impacts.
   Methods: Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with Crew
   alumni (n = 16, 67 \% female) in Victoria, Australia. Template analysis
   was used to analyse the data, using the Bronfenbrenner's
   Process-PersonContext-Time (PPCT) as an organising framework. Results:
   Crew participation enhanced interpersonal skills such as leadership,
   communication, public speaking, and empathy that alumni continued to use
   in their study, work, and relationships. Participants reported
   maintenance of key Mental Health First Aid skills, including knowledge
   of mental health problems and confidence to help others experiencing a
   mental health crisis. Their own help-seeking behaviours improved during
   and after Crew participation. Effective adult support was vital in
   shaping participant experiences; however, when such support did not
   consider the school or community context, it negatively impacted Crew
   members' experiences. Crew alumni characterised the Live4Life model as
   unique in a context with high stigma around mental health challenges and
   limited mental health education. Conclusions: Alumni described the
   Live4Life Crew program as an impactful and positive experience.
   Participants noted the importance of tailoring implementation to
   specific settings to further enhance the program's impact.},

Title = {Working With People With Experience of Psychosis to Co-Design an
   Educational and Anti-Stigma Psychosis Intervention for Schools},
Journal = {HEALTH EXPECTATIONS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {28},
Number = {5},
Month = {OCT 17},
Abstract = {Introduction: Psychosis is a particularly stigmatised condition in
   adolescent populations, with prevalent stigmatising beliefs surrounding
   it including negative stereotypes around dangerousness, unpredictability
   and chronicity. Additionally, the first episodes of psychosis increase
   significantly during late adolescence, and there is a lack of
   understanding and recognition of psychosis in young people. Given these
   factors, psychosis appears to be an important topic for mental health
   literacy and anti-stigma programmes. However, there is a lack of
   consensus surrounding the best way to construct psychosis anti-stigma
   interventions for young people. Voices of people with experience of
   psychosis seem crucial in this regard, but their experiences of stigma
   and discrimination are rarely heard. By including their perspectives
   along with those of other stakeholders, we aim to ensure that we gain a
   better, more balanced perspective on how to talk about psychosis with
   young people. Methods: This study reports on the co-design process of a
   psychosis anti-stigma educational intervention for young people using
   the short-form Guidance for Reporting Involvement of Patients and the
   Public (GRIPP-2) checklist as a guiding framework. Six workshops were
   held over 3 months, with experts with experience of psychosis working
   with clinicians and academics. These workshops explored the differing
   views of these groups on how we understand, talk about and perceive
   psychosis. Results: This process resulted in an educational module named
   `Reality and Psychosis', which we believe will prove effective in not
   only educating but also diminishing stigma surrounding psychosis among
   young people. Conclusion: By incorporating various perspectives, we hope
   to provide a well-rounded and balanced approach to addressing the
   complexities of discussing psychosis with young people. The GRIPP-2
   checklist also proved to be a useful framework for assisting the
   reporting process. Patient or Public Contribution: Individuals with
   lived experience of psychosis participated throughout the co-design
   process. Specifically, they contributed to the six workshops by sharing
   their personal experiences of stigma, discrimination and recovery, which
   informed the development of the educational module. This helped ensure
   the voices of those directly affected by psychosis were authentically
   represented.},

   randomized controlled trial design, 5-6th grade students (11-13 years)
   attending three rural elementary schools in low-income and predominant
   African American communities were invited to participate. A total of 109
   students (91\% African American/Black) participated in the program (91\%
   participation rate) and were randomized into treatment group-who
   received ALLY (n = 57) or control group (n = 52). All students completed
   a pre-post-assessment (baseline and post-program). A total of 58\% youth
   in the treatment group endorsed negative affect at baseline and this was
   reduced to 53\% post-program delivery (p < 0.01). No change in negative
   affect was reported in control group (44\% pre and 44\% post with
   self-reported negative affect). These results suggest that participants
   at greatest risk for mental health issues may benefit from ALLY.},

Title = {Mixed Reality in Undergraduate Mental Health Education: A Systematic
   Review},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The landscape of Extended Reality (ER), which includes Virtual Reality
   (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR) is rapidly
   changing. However, despite the promising results from many randomized
   controlled trials (RCTs) developed on healthcare environments, there is
   a lack of standardization, specifically to determine their effectiveness
   in academic settings. To our best knowledge, this is the first
   systematic review addressing the efficacy of MR to enhance learning and
   skills acquisition in undergraduate mental health education. The
   purposes of this study were to review the scientific literature of those
   studies involving MR and undergraduate mental health education, to
   answer the two following questions: (1) Is MR useful to enhance the
   acquisition of knowledge and skill training in undergraduate mental
   health education, and (2) Which are the advantages and disadvantages
   that should be addressed to successfully develop MR in undergraduate
   mental health education? We conducted a systematic review of the
   peer-reviewed literature from EBSCO, Ovid, PubMed, and Scopus y WOS (Web
   of Science), following the PRISMA statements and using ``mixed reality +
   education{''}, ``mixed reality + student{''}, ``mixed reality +
   undergraduate{''}, and ``mixed reality + mental health{''}, as keywords.
   Those studies published between 2012 to present, in English or Spanish
   language, were reviewed. A total of 2608 records were retrieved, and
   only 6 publications met the inclusion criteria, and were finally
   included. MR training used was varied. There were no studies providing
   specific outcomes regarding the student's acquired knowledge
   (theoretical concepts) after using MR. Several strengths and weaknesses
   of using MR with students were discussed. The results will be useful to
   develop innovative MR strategies to improve undergraduate mental health
   education, due to the lack of studies focused on this topic.},

Abstract = {A quarter of all children grow up in a family where a parent experiences
   a mental illness (FaPMI). Research activity in this area is growing
   rapidly and it is now critical to better understand the extant knowledge
   in the field. This scoping review of quantitative FaPMI literature
   parallels a qualitative literature review and a series of Delphi studies
   with key stakeholders (e.g. lived experience and clinicians), that is
   part of a larger program of research to achieve consensus regarding the
   direction of FaPMI research; including making recommendations about
   outcomes and measures. The programme of research aims to promote and
   facilitate greater comparison and learning across studies and settings.
   Initially this scoping review summarises the quality and focus (e.g.
   country and sampling) of 50 quantitative studies from 2000 to 2023 and
   then classifies studies according to outcomes for parents, children and
   families. Six to eleven years were the most common child sample group
   and girls were slightly underrepresented (49/51) and parents were 88\%
   mothers. Analogous parent and child outcomes were; mental
   illness/psychopathology, wellbeing, mental health literacy, trauma and
   stressful experiences, coping, help seeking/service need, within family
   relationships and supports, outside family relationships and supports.
   Additional outcomes for parents were; parenting skills, parent
   competence and parenting stress and for children in relation to their;
   cognitive functioning and caregiving. The family related outcomes were
   the within and outside family relationships and supports. Since 2000
   there have been 136 different survey instruments employed with
   approximately 80\% used in only one study. This suggests that the
   broader goals of the program of research are warranted as there is a
   need for less heterogeneity in measures used. Suggested areas for future
   research include a sampling focus on fathers, economic evaluations of
   programs, parent mental health literacy, trauma, genetics and
   integrating well-being concepts into research designs. Child research
   should focus on mental health literacy, the level and impact of caring
   responsibilities, assessing past trauma and the roles of close family
   and external supports.},

Title = {The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental
   Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {26},
Month = {FEB 29},
Abstract = {Background: Accelerated by technological advancements and the recent
   global pandemic, there is burgeoning interest in digital mental health
   literacy (DMHL) interventions that can positively affect mental health.
   However, existing work remains inconclusive regarding the effectiveness
   of DMHL interventions. Objective: This systematic review and meta
   -analysis investigated the components and modes of DMHL interventions,
   their moderating factors, and their long-term impacts on mental health
   literacy and mental health. Methods: We used a random -effects model to
   conduct meta -analyses and meta -regressions on moderating effects of
   DMHL interventions on mental health. Results: Using 144 interventions
   with 206 effect sizes, we found a moderate effect of DMHL interventions
   in enhancing distal mental health outcomes (standardized mean
   difference=0.42, 95\% CI -0.10 to 0.73; P<.001) and a large effect in
   increasing proximal mental health literacy outcomes (standardized mean
   difference=0.65, 95\% CI 0.59-0.74; P<.001). Uptake of DMHL
   interventions was comparable with that of control conditions, and uptake
   of DMHL interventions did not moderate the effects on both proximal
   mental health literacy outcomes and distal mental health outcomes. DMHL
   interventions were as effective as face-to-face interventions and did
   not differ by platform type or dosage. DMHL plus interventions (DMHL
   psychoeducation coupled with other active treatment) produced large
   effects in bolstering mental health, were more effective than DMHL only
   interventions (self-help DMHL psychoeducation), and were comparable with
   non-DMHL interventions (treatment as usual). DMHL interventions
   demonstrated positive effects on mental health that were sustained over
   follow-up assessments and were most effective in enhancing the mental
   health of emerging and older adults. Conclusions: For theory building,
   our review and meta -analysis found that DMHL interventions are as
   effective as face-to-face interventions. DMHL interventions confer
   optimal effects on mental health when DMHL psychoeducation is combined
   with informal, nonprofessional active treatment components such as
   skills training and peer support, which demonstrate comparable
   effectiveness with that of treatment as usual (client -professional
   interactions and therapies). These effects, which did not differ by
   platform type or dosage, were sustained over time. Additionally, most
   DMHL interventions are found in Western cultural contexts, especially in
   high -income countries (Global North) such as Australia, the United
   States, and the United Kingdom, and limited research is conducted in
   low-income countries in Asia and in South American and African
   countries. Most of the DMHL studies did not report information on the
   racial or ethnic makeup of the samples. Future work on DMHL
   interventions that target racial or ethnic minority groups, particularly
   the design, adoption, and evaluation of the effects of culturally
   adaptive DMHL interventions on uptake and mental health functioning, is
   needed. Such evidence can drive the adoption and implementation of DMHL
   interventions at scale, which represents a key foundation for practice
   -changing impact in the provision of mental health resources for
   individuals and the community.},

Abstract = {Considering the disparity between mental health services and resources
   available in Nigeria, researchers have highlighted the need for
   organizations, policymakers, and health service providers to revamp
   their approaches. Due to its unifying nature and cultural importance in
   the youth population, grassroots sport programming has been shown to be
   an effective mechanism in promoting education and life skills. In Lagos,
   Nigeria, the Basketball Experience program was designed to promote
   physical well-being, healthy living, mental health, and life skills in
   Nigerian youth utilizing principles from the Resilience and Youth
   Development Module. Researchers interviewed seven female and three male
   coaches using a phenomenological approach to investigate their
   perspectives of the program's impact on themselves and the youth they
   coach. Results suggest that implementing mental health education and
   resilience development, specifically through positive mentorship and
   strategies such as breathing and mindfulness exercises, into a sport for
   development program can assist with increased knowledge and reduced
   mental health stigma. Coaches strongly endorsed increased use of
   programs like Basketball Experience to promote positive development and
   combat the disparity in mental health literacy and policy, and they
   suggested that such programs have the power to help restructure the
   longstanding cycle of negative stressors inherent to life in Nigeria.
   Based on these perspectives, the authors discuss how grassroots sport
   programming can be an effective tool in the development of both coaches
   and youth. Moreover, the authors advocate for the Resilience and Youth
   Development Module as an impactful theoretical framework for
   facilitating resilience and life skills in coaches and youth.},

Abstract = {Purpose of review
   Addressing youth mental health in secondary schools has received greater
   attention globally in the past decade. It is essential that educators,
   mental health experts, researchers, and other related service providers
   understand the most current research findings to inform policy making,
   and identify priority areas for the development of future interventions
   and research strategies. This review describes literature during the
   past year on school-based mental health programs addressing mental
   health promotion, prevention, early identification and
   intervention/treatment.
   Recent findings
   In contrast to the abundance of school-based mental health programs, the
   evidence of program effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness in this
   area is somewhat insufficient, mostly due to the lack of rigorous
   research designs, the heterogeneity of school environments, and the
   complexities of interventions that require multisector collaboration.
   Summary
   Although the opportunity in school mental health is substantial, much
   yet needs to be done to develop and evaluate interventions that can be
   proven to be effective, safe and cost-effective. Mental health literacy
   may be an appropriate start that will help to set the foundation for
   mental health promotion, prevention and intervention.},

Title = {Understanding Family Experiences: A Study on Mental Health Literacy in
   Adolescent Eating Disorder Diagnoses},
Journal = {NURSING REPORTS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Pages = {4145-4161},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: Adolescent eating disorders pose a significant public health
   challenge and strongly affect both physical and emotional well-being.
   Early diagnosis is important for improving treatment outcomes, though it
   remains complex due to multiple influencing factors. The family
   perspective is essential in this process, as it provides valuable
   insights into changes in adolescents' habits and emotional health.
   Methods: A descriptive qualitative study was conducted between January
   and February 2023. Interviews were conducted with 12 participants using
   a phenomenological approach to explore the experiences and perspectives
   of family members of adolescents with eating disorders. Results: Four
   thematic blocks comprising several categories were identified: (T1)
   diagnosis, (T2) family, (T3) resources, and (T4) treatment. The
   participants emphasized the need for early intervention and a
   multidisciplinary approach to the treatment of eating disorders. Family
   therapy was recognized as vital to treatment, and common dissatisfaction
   with the public health structure underscores the need for greater
   investment in research and access to specialists. Mental health nurse
   practitioners play an important role in providing comprehensive care and
   support, as well as mental health literacy. Conclusions: A holistic,
   patient-centered approach, including family involvement and appropriate
   support systems, is key to improving the outcomes and quality of life of
   adolescents undergoing treatment for eating disorders. Improving
   healthcare resources and addressing the challenges faced by families is
   essential. In addition, mental health literacy is critical, as it
   enables families to understand the disease better, make informed
   decisions, and actively participate in the recovery process, thus
   contributing to improved therapeutic outcomes and quality of life for
   patients.},

Abstract = {Objective The objective of this study was to investigate the Korean
   public's recognition of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), revealing
   underlying factors regarding perception relative to etiology and
   treatment of ASD, and examining variables related to those factors.
   Methods An online survey was held to investigate mental health literacy
   (MHL) on ASD of the general public in Korea. A total of 673 adults
   participated and completed questionnaires on socio-demographic
   characteristics and if they know someone with ASD. Next, participants
   were provided with a vignette describing a child with ASD. Only those
   that recognized there was a problem with the child moved to the next
   part which asked their perception regarding etiology and treatment of
   ASD.
   Results According to our study, approximately 25\% of participants
   correctly recognized the child in the vignette as having ASD. Perception
   regarding etiology and treatment of ASD varied among socio-demographic
   characteristics. Participants acquainted with someone with ASD and
   correctly recognized ASD held mixed perception regarding cause and
   treatment.
   Conclusion This study investigated MHL of ASD in Korea. The result
   reveals there is much room for improvement relative to raising awareness
   on MHL of ASD. Intervention considering socio-demographic
   characteristics and acquaintance with ASD are needed.},

Title = {Evaluation of an Online Campaign for Promoting Help-Seeking Attitudes
   for Depression Using a Facebook Advertisement: An Online Randomized
   Controlled Experiment},
Journal = {JMIR MENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {2},

Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {Background: A depression-awareness campaign delivered through the
   Internet has been recommended as a public health approach that would
   enhance mental health literacy and encourage help-seeking attitudes.
   However, the outcomes of such a campaign remain understudied.
   Objective: The main aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness
   of an online depression awareness campaign, which was informed by the
   theory of planned behavior, to encourage help-seeking attitudes for
   depression and to enhance mental health literacy in Hong Kong. The
   second aim was to examine click-through behaviors by varying the
   affective facial expressions of people in the Facebook advertisements.
   Methods: Potential participants were recruited through Facebook
   advertisements, using either a happy or sad face illustration. Volunteer
   participants registered for the study by clicking on the advertisement
   and were invited to leave their personal email addresses to receive
   educational content about depression. The participants were randomly
   assigned into two groups (campaign or control), and over a four
   consecutive week period, received either the campaign material or
   official information developed by the Hospital Authority in Hong Kong.
   Pretests and posttests were conducted before and after the campaign to
   measure the differences in help-seeking attitudes and mental health
   literacy among the campaign and control groups.
   Results: Of the 199 participants that registered and completed the
   pretest, 116 (55 campaign and 62 control) completed the campaign and the
   posttest. At the posttest, we found no significant changes in
   help-seeking attitudes between the campaign and control groups, but the
   campaign group participants demonstrated a statistically significant
   improvement in mental health literacy (P=.031) and a higher willingness
   to access additional information (P<.001) than the control group.
   Moreover, the happy face Facebook advertisement attracted more
   click-throughs by users into the website than did the sad face
   advertisement (P=.03).
   Conclusions: The present study provides evidence that an online campaign
   can enhance people's mental health literacy. It also demonstrates the
   practicality and effectiveness of an online depression awareness
   campaign using a Facebook-based recruitment strategy and distribution of
   educational materials through emails. It is important for future studies
   to take advantage of the popularity of online social media and conduct
   evaluative research on mental health promotion campaigns.},

Abstract = {Although improving the mental health of children and adolescents has
   become a global priority, resources outlining developmentally
   appropriate content for improving mental health literacy (MHL) across
   school-aged children are scarce. A comprehensive, life-course approach
   to building MHL is needed to address the evolving competencies, needs,
   capacities, and risk factors for mental health, especially to establish
   school-based interventions that can be equitably and sustainably
   implemented. We conducted a theoretical review highlighting the relation
   of research and practice in building MHL through developmentally
   appropriate knowledge and competencies for children and adolescents. A
   two-pronged review of the literature was conducted to provide an
   overview of (1) research with a focus on neurobiological, psychological,
   cognitive, and social developmental milestones of school-aged children
   relevant for building MHL and (2) evidence-based and theory-driven
   content for the development of universal MHL interventions for children
   and adolescents considering the four components of MHL. A map of
   relevant key milestones highlights the range of development that occurs
   and ample opportunity for increasing universal MHL during these
   sensitive years primed for learning. We reflect on current
   understandings and global considerations for MHL interventions with an
   emphasis on applying developmental science to the future strengthening
   of intervention development, uptake, adaptation, implementation,

   Interventions in Secondary Education? Needs and Perspectives of

Abstract = {Mental health literacy (MHL) interventions in secondary schools may help
   to improve competencies that adolescents require to stay mentally
   healthy and seek help if mental health problems arise. These MHL
   interventions should be tailored to the needs of adolescents and
   educational professionals (EPs) to reach sustainable implementation and
   long-term effectiveness. However, evidence is lacking on these needs.
   Thus, our aim was to explore their experiences with, and perspectives
   on, mental health help seeking and needs regarding MHL interventions. We
   performed online focus group discussions and interviews with adolescents
   (n = 21; 13-19 years) and EPs (n = 12) and analyzed the data using
   directed content analysis. We identified three themes related to mental
   health help seeking: (1) Limited MHL competencies of adolescents, (2)
   Limited competencies of EP to provide mental health support, and (3)
   Limited mental health promotion in the school environment. We further
   identified three themes regarding MHL interventions: (1) Addressing
   basic mental health knowledge and skills, (2) Interactive and easily
   accessible, and (3) Sustainable implementation. Improving the MHL
   competencies of adolescents and EPs, and creating a mental
   health-literate school environment can promote adolescents' mental
   health help seeking. Our findings highlight the importance of developing
   MHL interventions that are tailored to both adolescents' and EPs needs.},

Abstract = {Disparities in mental health care and access to care disproportionately
   affect youth from minoritized and low-income communities. School-based
   prevention programs have the potential to offer a non-stigmatized
   approach to mental health care as well as the ability to reach many
   students simultaneously. Advocates 4 All Youth (ALLY) is a program
   developed for 5-6th grade students aimed at improving self-efficacy and
   resilience via individualized sessions with a trusted adult (ALLYs). The
   feasibility of delivering ALLY in a racially and minoritized low-income
   community is discussed and modifications required to implement the
   program documented. Students completed questionnaires and sessions with
   an ALLY. Aspects of program delivery deemed feasible included training
   ALLYs to delivery program, stakeholder buy-in regarding missing class
   time, and students attending the sessions. Further modifications
   included adjustments to materials due to lower reading level and health
   literacy related-educational needs. Programs designed in one demographic
   setting may not work in a different setting.},

Abstract = {Purpose There is urgent need to explore medical students' understandings
   of mental illness to better support this high-risk group. The purpose of
   this paper is to evaluate mental health literacy in medical students
   using the Mental Health Literacy Scale (MHLS), and provide validation of
   the measure. Design/methodology/approach In total, 251 participants were
   recruited from medical schools across the UK. Participants completed
   demographic details and the MHLS. This paper reports total MHLS scores
   and their relationships with demographics and experiences with mental
   illness. Findings The mean MHLS score was 127.69. MHL was significantly
   higher in females, and students in later years of study (p<0.05). Over
   40 per cent of respondents reported having personal experience of mental
   illness. This, as well as having a close friend or family member with a
   mental illness, was associated with higher MHL (p<0.05).
   Originality/value This study is the first to use the MHLS and provide
   validation of this measure in medical students. Despite high rates of
   personal experience with mental health issues, medical students' average
   MHLS scores were comparable to studies of non-medical student groups.
   Medical schools should aim to build students' confidence in recognising
   and seeking help for mental health issues from the first year of medical
   training. MHL is a multi-faceted issue; further work is required to
   improve awareness of risk factors, to better understand why males
   demonstrate poorer MHL scores than females, and to work towards
   improving MHL in males.},

Abstract = {Background: Stigma education for nursing students has focused solely on
   stigma reduction, with studies showing temporary improvements in
   attitudes. However, nursing education research should also emphasize the
   importance of critical reflection and self-reflection to enhance
   attitudes, beliefs, topic comprehension, and learning satisfaction. This
   study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the ``This is me{''}
   intervention regarding knowledge, attitudes, and communication skills of
   senior undergraduate nursing students in responding to mental
   illness-related stigma. Methods: This study employed a psychoeducational
   intervention for reducing mental illness stigma, using a questionnaire
   survey to assess pre- and post-intervention effects, with 37 eligible
   nursing students undergoing clinical training in psychiatric services
   between 16 May and 15 July 2022. Instruments included sociodemographic
   and health questions, the MICA-4 scale to evaluate students' attitudes
   toward mental illness, the MAKS to measure mental health knowledge, the
   Empathy Scale (JSPE-S), the Intergroup Anxiety Scale (SS-12), and the
   Attribution Questionnaire (AQ-27). Results: Most students were female
   (73.0\%) and single (70.3\%), with a mean age of around 29 years. After
   implementing the psychoeducational program, there was a statistically
   significant increase in overall stigma-related knowledge (MAKS: Z =
   -1.99, p < 0.05), a decrease in intergroup anxiety (IAS: Z = -3.42, p <
   0.05), and reductions in the perceptions of patients as dangerous
   (AQ27-Dangerousness: Z = -2.399, p < 0.05) and fear (AQ27-Fear: Z =
   -2.415, p < 0.05). Additionally, there was an improvement in empathy,
   specifically in Perspective Taking (JSPE: Z = -2.555, p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: This program may contribute to mental health literacy
   related to stigma, positively impacting therapeutic relationships and
   communication with people with mental illness and resulting in more
   effective care practices.},

   and higher education. This paper offers a comprehensive analysis of how
   MHE is integrated in Chinese schools. It first examines the current
   state of integration through a review of policy and relevant literature.
   It then explores the key challenges across four dimensions:
   institutional mechanisms, educational practices, targeted interventions,
   and teacher workforce development. Finally, the paper discusses future
   directions for advancing MHE in Chinese schools, including updating
   educational philosophies, strengthening institutional frameworks,
   building holistic student support systems, and enhancing teacher
   training, ultimately aiming to promote the high-quality development of
   MHE in China.},

Title = {Mental health care for youth with rheumatologic diseases - bridging the
   gap},
Journal = {PEDIATRIC RHEUMATOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {15},
Month = {DEC 28},
Abstract = {Youth with rheumatologic diseases have a high prevalence of comorbid
   mental health disorders. Individuals with comorbid mental health
   disorders are at increased risk for adverse outcomes related to mental
   health as well as their underlying rheumatologic disease. Early
   identification and treatment of mental health disorders has been shown
   to improve outcomes, but current systems of care fall short in providing
   adequate mental health services to those in need. Pediatric
   rheumatologists are uniquely positioned to provide mental health
   screening and intervention for youth with rheumatologic diseases due to
   the frequency of patient encounters and ongoing therapeutic relationship
   with patients and families. However, additional training is likely
   required for pediatric rheumatologists to provide effective mental
   health care, and focusing efforts on providing trainees with mental
   health education is key to building competency. Potential opportunities
   for improved mental health education include development of clinical
   guidelines regarding mental health screening and management within
   pediatric rheumatology settings and incorporation of mental health
   didactics, workshops, and interdisciplinary clinic experiences into
   pediatric rheumatology fellowship curricula. Additional steps include
   mental health education for patients and families and focus on system
   change, targeting integration of medical and mental health care.
   Research is needed to better define the scope of the problem, determine
   effective strategies for equipping pediatric rheumatologists with skills
   in mental health intervention, and develop and implement sustainable
   systems for delivery of optimal mental health care to youth with
   rheumatologic diseases.},

Title = {The effectiveness of mental health literacy digital awareness campaign
   on social discrimination, willingness to seek professional psychological
   help, and intended behaviors among high school students in Jordan},
Journal = {DIGITAL HEALTH},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {11},
Abstract = {Objective: The study aimed to assess the effectiveness of mental health
   literacy digital awareness campaign, on the levels of social
   discrimination against mental illness, willingness to seek professional
   psychological help, and intended future behaviors among high school
   students in Jordan.
   Methods: A one-group pre-test-post-test study design was used, involving
   43 high school students. The intervention included posting podcast
   series and reels through private Facebook groups over 1 month.
   Results: The students demonstrated significantly lowered perception of
   social discrimination ((sic) = 0.35, p < .001), more intended future
   behaviors ((sic) = 0.08, p < .001), and increased willingness to seek
   help ((sic) = 0.84, p = .029) over time. The magnitude of these changes
   was large for social discrimination (Cohen's d = 1.34) and intended
   behaviors (d = 3.00), and small to medium for willingness to seek help
   (d = 0.42). Male students (M = 16.3, SD = 2.1) scored significantly
   lower in willingness to seek help (M = 18.4, SD = 2.6) than females.
   Those with prior psychological referrals had higher social
   discrimination (t = 2.47, p = .018).
   Conclusion: This study offers school mental health professionals a
   valuable tool to support high school students through accessible
   platforms like social media.},

Abstract = {This research explored parents' mental health literacy (MHL) skills
   (i.e., recognizing symptoms and identifying effective help-seeking
   strategies) for child attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
   and anxiety, factors associated with their MHL, and preferences for
   receiving information about each disorder. N = 128 parents were
   recruited from community organizations to participate in an online
   survey. Parents were randomly assigned to read one vignette depicting a
   child with symptoms of ADHD or anxiety. They were asked to identify the
   depicted problem and rate the helpfulness of potential help-seeking
   strategies (i.e., different health professionals and medications). They
   also completed measures of parental self-efficacy and parenting stress
   and indicated information preferences for learning about symptoms and
   treatment. Parents scored just above the mid-range on a measure of their
   MHL skills, with no significant difference between parents responding to
   the ADHD and anxiety vignettes. Stronger MHL was associated with being a
   mother, having personal, family, or friend-related mental health
   experience, and stronger parental self-efficacy. Parents were interested
   in receiving more information about child ADHD and anxiety via health
   provider or written format. Results are valuable for informing future
   MHL intervention efforts to educate parents about symptoms and treatment
   for common child mental health problems such as ADHD and anxiety.},

Title = {Characteristics of mental health literacy measurement in youth: a
   scoping review of school-based surveys},
Journal = {DISCOVER MENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 18},
Abstract = {Mental health literacy (MHL) was introduced 25 years ago as knowledge
   and beliefs about mental disorders which aid in their recognition,
   management, or prevention. This scoping review mapped the peer-reviewed
   literature to assess characteristics of secondary school-based surveys
   in school-attending youth and explore components of school-based
   programs for fostering MHL in this population. The search was performed
   following the method for scoping reviews by the Joanna Briggs Institute
   (JBI). Searches were conducted in four scientific databases with no time
   limit, although all sources had to be written in English. Primary
   studies (N = 44) provided insight into MHL surveys and programs for
   school-attending youth across 6 continents. Studies reported that most
   youth experience moderate or low MHL prior to program participation.
   School-based MHL programs are relatively unified in their definition and
   measures of MHL, using closed-ended scales, vignettes, or a combination
   of the two to measure youth MHL. However, before developing additional
   interventions, steps should be taken to address areas of weakness in
   current programming, such as the lack of a standardized tool for
   assessing MHL levels. Future research could assess the feasibility of
   developing and implementing a standard measurement protocol, with
   educator perspectives on integrating MHL efforts into the classroom.
   Identifying the base levels of MHL amongst school-attending youth
   promotes the development of targeted programs and reviewing the
   alignment with program components would allow researchers to build on
   what works, alter what does not, and come away with new ways to approach
   these complex challenges, ultimately advancing knowledge of MHL and
   improving levels of MHL.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Assessing the Mental Health Literacy (MHL) of stu-dents is
   crucial in having an understanding of mental health knowl-edge gaps,
   stigma, wrong beliefs, risk factors, and treatment-seeking behaviour.
   The aim of this study was to use a validated scale to ex-amine the MHL
   of radiography students at a tertiary institution in Harare, Zimbabwe.
   Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive survey was conducted to assess
   the MHL of radiography students at a tertiary institution in Harare,
   Zimbabwe, using a validated MHL scale. Individual t-tests and analy-sis
   of variance (ANOVA) tests were conducted for each variable to ex-amine
   the differences between groups expected to differ in their MHL. Results:
   A total of 89 students were enrolled into the study. The over-all mean
   MHL score was 96.62 ( SD-9.55), with students less knowl-edgeable on
   environmental, social, familial, or biological factors that increase the
   risk of developing a mental illness. Gender had no statis-tically
   significant effect on the overall score, t(83) =-0.81, p = 0.42 {[}Males
   had mean score = 95.64, SD = 10.14; and Females had mean score = 97.35,
   SD = 9.12]] . However, there was a significant differ-ence in
   recognition of disorders by gender, t (83) =-2.42, p = 0.02, with female
   students ( M = 26.24, SD = 2.68) scoring higher than male students ( M =
   24.69, SD = 3.21 ). In addition, students with a previous history of
   mental health disorders scored higher ( M = 26.86, SD = 2.19 ) than
   those with no previous history (M = 25.47, SD = 3.04) , however the
   difference was not statistically significant. Conclusion: The students
   in the current study demonstrated lower MHL compared to most studies in
   the literature. Students were less knowledgeable about environmental,
   social, familial, or biological fac-tors that increase the risk of
   developing a mental illness. Furthermore, a correlation between MHL and
   mental health experience was demon-strated. The implication of these
   findings is that the curriculum ought to be developed to help
   undergraduate radiography students become more knowledgeable about
   mental health and comfortable seeking ap-propriate support},

Title = {Validation of the Arabic version of the Mental Health Literacy Scale
   (MHLS) in three Arab samples},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {20},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 26},
Abstract = {Mental Health Literacy (MHL) is pivotal for understanding and addressing
   mental disorders, often assessed using the comprehensive Mental Health
   Literacy Scale (MHLS) across six dimensions and 35 items. However,
   research on MHL within Arab populations is not just scarce, but
   alarmingly so, indicating a significant gap in knowledge regarding MHL
   in this demographic. This study aimed to fill this gap by adapting the
   MHLS into Arabic and evaluating its psychometric properties among three
   distinct Arabic-speaking groups: adolescents, students, and the general
   public. Data were collected using the translated MHLS, the General
   Health Questionnaire, and sociodemographic measures, employing a
   cross-sectional design. Validation procedures were conducted, including
   exploratory factor analysis, reliability testing, and face validity
   assessment. Construct validity was assessed using Pearson correlation
   analysis and t-tests. The validation process yielded three modified
   versions of the MHLS in Arabic: MHLS-Arabic-Adolescents (31 items, 5
   factors), MHLS-Arabic-Students (30 items, 6 factors), and
   MHLS-Arabic-General Public (33 items, 5 factors). These tools
   demonstrated robust construct validity and high-reliability coefficients
   and stood as a testament to their adaptability and potential for use in
   diverse Arabic-speaking populations. This study suggests the nuanced
   nature of MHL and points to the importance of micro-context-specific
   validation. Providing three reliable MHLS Arabic versions could
   facilitate research on MHL among Arabic-speaking populations worldwide,
   potentially leading to tailored intervention initiatives that aim to
   enhance mental health outcomes and ensure equitable access to services
   within Arab communities globally.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Understanding why nearly 80\% of youth ages 6-18 years with a
   mental disorder fail to receive treatment represents an important public
   health priority. International data suggest that underrecognition of
   mental illness and the need for treatment are barriers to service
   utilization. This study extends work to a U.S. sample of 1,104
   adolescents.
   Methods: High School students were invited to participate in a
   self-report study assessing knowledge and beliefs regarding mental
   illness. Participants completed the survey in groups at school and read
   vignettes portraying peers experiencing major depression, social anxiety
   disorder, and a situation where the individual has to cope with a common
   life stressor followed by a series of questions in reference to each
   vignette.
   Results: Adolescents had better recognition of depression than social
   anxiety disorder and were more likely to recommend seeking help for it.
   However, <50\% of youth recognized depression. Family, friends, and
   counselors were recommended as sources of help. Differences according to
   the sex of the respondent and person in the vignette were observed.
   Conclusions: These data are among the first to provide information
   regarding the mental health literacy of American adolescents and suggest
   potential points for intervention. Pending replication of the findings
   herein, efforts to help adolescents recognize mental health problems and
   to increase the likelihood of recommending professional help will be
   important. (C) 2016 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All

Abstract = {Background: Major depression is a common disorder among teenagers and is
   associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Suicide is the
   third leading cause of death among 15-24 year olds. Early identification
   and treatment is essential to prevent suicide. Depression education is a
   potential intervention for improving knowledge about depression and
   help-seeking behavior.
   Methods: The Adolescent Depression Awareness Program (ADAP) is a
   school-based depression education intervention with a core message that
   depression is a treatable medical illness. 710 high school students from
   six schools in Tulsa, OK participated in the study comparing changes in
   knowledge about depression and attitudes toward treatment-seeking
   between students receiving the intervention and those who did not
   Changes in depression knowledge and attitude toward help-seeking were
   measured using the ADAP Depression Knowledge Questionnaire (ADKQ).
   Results: There was a significant positive change in ADKQ score for
   students receiving the intervention but not in the control group. The
   intervention group also demonstrated a significant difference in
   willingness to ``tell someone{''} if concerned about depression in a
   peer, which was not present in the control group.
   Limitations: The students were not randomized to the intervention and
   control groups. The ADKQ evaluates attitudes about help-seeking but not
   behavior.
   Conclusions: A school-based educational intervention improved knowledge
   about depression and attitudes toward help-seeking in adolescents.
   Future studies should investigate if such change in knowledge results in
   help-seeking behaviors. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Background/Objectives: Mental health literacy (MHL) plays a crucial role
   in transitional processes, influencing, for example, students'
   adaptation to higher education and, later, their transition into the
   workforce. This study assesses MHL about depression among first- and
   fourth-year nursing students and identifies which MHL components and
   related variables are associated with a higher likelihood of being in
   either academic year. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive
   correlational study was conducted with 478 nursing students (59.4\%
   first-year students; 40.6\% fourth-year students), predominantly female
   (82.2\%), with a mean age of 20.41 years (SD = 4.71) and a median age of
   19.0 years. Results: The results revealed a low level of recognition of
   depression and knowledge of mental health first aid (MHFA) strategies,
   including health literacy. Students tended not to hold beliefs based on
   myths and stereotypes about mental illness and individuals with mental
   illness and did not have highly stigmatizing views. MHL varied by year
   of study, with fourth-year students having more adequate MHL levels.
   Conclusions: These findings highlight the need to integrate MHL as a key
   element of academic success. Health education initiatives that promote
   mental health, prevention, and MHFA training may serve as effective
   strategies to enhance MHL among nursing students.},

Title = {Universal digital mental health interventions for children and youth: a
   scoping review},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN DIGITAL HEALTH},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {7},
Month = {NOV 17},
Abstract = {Introduction: Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) are
   increasingly used to support child and youth mental health, yet the
   scope and characteristics of universal (Tier 1) DMHIs remain poorly
   defined. Methods: This scoping review synthesized peer- reviewed studies
   of universal DMHIs delivered to children and youth aged 0-18 years.
   Results: Use of online programs and hybrid delivery were prevalent. Many
   programs used an independent structure, while facilitation varied across
   self- led, facilitator-led, and both-led models. Outcomes were commonly
   assessed across multiple domains, including emotional, behavioural,
   social, and cognitive outcomes. When single domains were examined, these
   most often focused on emotional outcomes such as anxiety and depression.
   Interventions frequently employed therapeutic approaches such as
   cognitive behavioural therapy and psychoeducation, with content
   emphasizing emotion regulation, coping and problem-solving skills, and
   mental health literacy. Structural features varied in length and number
   of sessions, and many included scaffolded self-managed elements such as
   messaging or check-ins. Early childhood was underrepresented, with
   limited reporting of child outcomes for ages 0-4. Equity considerations
   were also limited, as many studies did not report race or ethnicity and
   sex and gender reporting was often binary or unspecified. Youth
   involvement in intervention design or consultation was uncommon.
   Discussion: This review provides an overview of the current landscape
   and identifies key gaps, including limited equity considerations, the
   underrepresentation of early childhood development, and minimal youth
   involvement. Clearer reporting of delivery structure and facilitation,
   stronger demographic reporting, and component-focused evaluation can
   support equitable, developmentally responsive scale-up. Systematic

Volume = {86},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND:Stigmatizing attitudes toward mental illness and low mental
   health literacy have been identified as links to social adversity, and
   barriers to seeking and adhering to treatment among adolescents
   suffering from mental illness. Prior research has found that it is
   possible to improve these outcomes using school-based mental health
   awareness interventions. The purpose of this study was to review
   empirical literature pertaining to universal mental health awareness
   interventions aiming to improve mental health related outcomes among
   students enrolled in US K-12 schools, especially minorities vulnerable
   to health disparities.
   METHODS:PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, PUBMED, and reference lists of
   relevant articles were searched for K-12 school-based mental health
   awareness interventions in the United States. Universal studies that
   measured knowledge, attitudes, and/or help-seeking pertinent to mental
   health were included.
   RESULTS:A total of 15 studies were selected to be part of the review.
   There were 7 pretest/post-test case series, 5 nonrandomized experimental
   trial, 1 Solomon 4-groups, and 2 randomized controlled trial (RCT)
   designs. Nine studies measuring knowledge, 8 studies measuring
   attitudes, and 4 studies measuring help-seeking, indicated statistically
   significant improvements.
   CONCLUSIONS:Although results of all studies indicated some level of
   improvement, more research on implementation of universal school-based
   mental health awareness programs is needed using RCT study designs, and
   long-term follow-up implementation.},

Abstract = {Mental health screening of athletes is of increasing concern to key
   stakeholders (e.g., sport administrators, psychologists, performance
   consultants, and coaches) at many institutions and governing bodies in
   the United States. Recently, Tomalski et al. (2019) described the
   implementation of a comprehensive collegiate student-athlete mental
   health screening program, including recommendations for professionals
   interested in replicating this program at other institutions. This
   excellent program involves resources and staffing that many institutions
   may not have. The current paper describes a variety of recommended
   adaptations of this comprehensive program and additional considerations
   to help professionals who have fewer resources or less institutional
   support to implement key aspects of student-athlete mental health
   screening. Specifically, recommendations for how to address staffing and
   time limitations, identify mental health providers, select screening
   questionnaires that maximize classification accuracy, and encourage
   accurate student-athlete reporting of mental health concerns are
   provided. Moreover, we emphasize the importance and utility of
   supporting mental health literacy of coaching staff as a cornerstone to
   effective mental health screening and intervention with collegiate

Title = {Mental health education for physiotherapists: A scoping review},
Journal = {SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {29},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Background: Physiotherapists play an integral role in the management of
   people living with a mental illness, yet little is known about their
   knowledge, attitudes and perceptions about mental health globally and
   particularly in South Africa.Aim: The purpose of the study is to map
   global evidence on mental health education for physiotherapists,
   including their knowledge, attitude and perceptions, with the goal of
   using this information to design an improved undergraduate curriculum
   for physiotherapy in South Africa.Setting: The search was focused on the
   South African and global context, with the participants as
   physiotherapists and physiotherapy students.Methods: The methodical
   framework proposed by Arksey and O'Malleys guided the scoping review.
   The online search used five electronic databases. An expert librarian
   assisted in the search strategy. English language, primary research
   articles that investigated physiotherapist or physiotherapy students'
   knowledge, attitude and perceptions towards mental health were
   sought.Results: The search strategy extracted 226 published studies and
   15 studies were included in the analysis. The results indicated that
   globally physiotherapists and physiotherapy students had limited
   knowledge about mental health. Improved attitudes were noted with a
   mental health training intervention. Negative perceptions were
   associated with limited knowledge.Conclusion: There was limited
   literature on the influence of education on mental health in
   physiotherapy on attitudes and perceptions. Physiotherapists desired
   more knowledge about mental health because of the prevalence of mental
   health disorders.Contribution: Because of the increasing prevalence of

Abstract = {Mentally ill people are among the most stigmatized, discriminated
   against and marginalized society members. The aims of this study were to
   explore adolescents' opinions about mental illness and determine whether
   these change after a mental health educational intervention. Two
   randomly selected schools took part in this study: one serving as
   intervention group and one as comparison group. Data were collected from
   both groups, before and after the intervention, using the Opinion about
   Mental Illness scale. Social Discrimination decreased significantly at
   the post-test in both groups. Score on Social Care factor significantly
   increased in the intervention group, and the overall change from
   pre-post to post-test period was significantly different between the
   groups. Social Integration significantly increased in the intervention
   group. A significant interaction effect was found indicating that the
   overall change was different between the two study groups. Thus, mental
   health educational interventions can positively influence the
   perceptions towards mental illness among adolescents.},

Abstract = {Background: Mental Health Literacy (MHL) has become a focus of research
   in recent decades, as a prerequisite for early identification and
   intervention for mental health problems. Although several instruments
   have been developed for assessing MHL, there is a need for brief and
   psychometrically sound measures to capture important aspects of MHL in
   large and diverse adult samples. The present study aimed to: (1) provide
   a revised and shorter version of a previously validated questionnaire
   for assessing MHL; and (2) examine the psychometric properties of the
   MHLq-SVa in student samples from six different countries (China, India,
   Indonesia, Portugal, Thailand, and United States). Methods: The study
   involved 2180 senior school and undergraduate students, aged between 17
   and 25 years old, from China, India, Indonesia, Portugal, Thailand, and
   the United States. Participants responded to the Mental Health Literacy
   Questionnaire for young adults (MHLq-ya), in their native language,
   following its translation and adaptation for each culture. The MHLq-ya
   comprises 29 items, organized into four dimensions: Knowledge of mental
   health problems; Erroneous beliefs/stereotypes; First-aid skills and
   help-seeking behavior; Self-help strategies. Confirmatory factor
   analyses and internal consistency analyses were performed on the
   combined data. Results: Data from the different countries supported a
   shorter version of the questionnaire (MHLq-SVa), composed of 16 items
   that fit with previously defined dimensions. Internal consistency and
   between-factor correlations further supported the adequacy of the
   instrument's psychometric properties. Conclusion: The study provided
   preliminary support for the construct validity and reliability of the
   MHLq-SVa as a measure for assessing MHL in young adults from six
   different countries and languages. Future studies are needed to further
   validate the measure and undertake multicultural comparisons of MHL in
   diverse samples from around the globe.},

Abstract = {Global health training opportunities have figured prominently into
   medical students' residency program choices across a range of clinical
   specialties. To date, however, the national scope of global mental
   health education has not heretofore been systematically assessed. We
   therefore sought to characterize the distribution of global health
   training opportunities in US graduate psychiatric education.
   We examined the web pages of all US psychiatry residency training
   programs, along with search results from a systematic Google query
   designed to identify global health training opportunities.
   Of the 183 accredited US psychiatry residency programs, we identified 17
   programs (9.3 \%) offering 28 global health training opportunities in 64
   countries. Ten psychiatry residency programs offered their residents
   opportunities to participate in one or more elective-based rotations,
   eight offered research activities, and six offered extended field-based
   training. Most global health training opportunities occurred within the
   context of externally administered, institution-wide initiatives
   generally available to residents from a range of clinical specialties,
   rather than within internally administered departmental initiatives
   specifically tailored for psychiatry residents.
   There are relatively few global health training opportunities in US
   graduate psychiatric education. These activities have a clear role in
   enhancing mastery of Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical
   Education core competencies, but important challenges related to program
   funding and evaluation remain.},

Title = {Mental health literacy amongst children with common mental health

Journal = {GLOBAL MENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {72-83},
Month = {FEB 21},
Abstract = {Background. Optimising mental health literacy (MHL) at the individual
   and population level can be an effective mental health improvement and
   prevention tool. However, concepts of MHL are largely based on evidence
   from high-income countries. Little is known about the manifestation and
   role of MHL in countries where collectivist health and social cultures
   are dominant.
   Aim. This study aimed to examine the MHL of Indonesian children and
   young people (CYP) with experience of common mental health problems and
   their parents.
   Methods. Semi-structured interviews with 40 participants (19 CYP aged
   11-15 with experience of common mental health problems and 21 parents)
   from three areas of Java, Indonesia. Data were analysed using framework
   analysis, informed by Jorm's 1997 Mental Health Literacy Framework.
   Results. Parents and CYP demonstrated relatively low levels of MHL
   defined from a conventional perspective. Religiosity and spirituality
   were salient in participants' accounts, particularly parents, as were
   narratives about personal responsibility. These beliefs appeared to
   contribute to a high level of self-blame for mental illness,
   self-reliance for symptom management, the foregrounding of support from
   spiritual/traditional healers and a reduced propensity to access
   professional help. CYP were heavily reliant on family support, but
   parents often felt they were not best placed to communicate with their
   children about mental health. Providing trusted, technology-based
   sources of mental health information were advocated by CYP.
   Conclusion. Robust efforts are needed to improve MHL in low- and
   middle-income countries drawing on culturally appropriate approaches to
   reduce stigma and optimise timely, effective help-seeking for CYP.
   Enhancing parental and family level literacy may be efficacious,
   especially when combined with mechanisms to facilitate open
   communication, as may the development of standalone interventions
   directly developed to reach younger generations. Future research may
   usefully establish the comparative efficacy and acceptability of these
   different approaches.},

Journal = {SSM-MENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {1},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: Low demand for mental health services in sub-Saharan Africa
   is driven by poor mental health literacy, stigma, and poor service
   availability. Objective: To develop a Community Mental Health Education
   and Detection (CMED) Tool for adults for use by community health teams
   in South Africa aligned with their roles of health promotion, screening
   and linkage to care. Methods: Formative evaluation methods involving
   four processes: (1) Ongoing engagement with the KwaZuluNatal Department
   of Health (KZN DoH) to ensure co-creation of the CMED tool and alignment
   with routine community health team activities; (2) Adaptation of the
   CMED tool from the Community Informant Detection Tool (CIDT), used to
   promote help-seeking of people with mental health problems in Nepal; (3)
   Review of the CMED vignettes and illustrations by a panel of local and
   international mental health care experts to establish accuracy and
   contextual and cultural relevance; (4) Process mapping and focus group
   discussions (FGDs) with community health teams in one district to
   establish cultural and contextual appropriateness as well as coherence
   and compatibility with existing community-based services. Results: The
   resulting CMED tool consists of five case vignettes and related
   illustrations to facilitate psychoeducation and the detection of
   possible depression, anxiety, psychosis, harmful alcohol use, and drug
   use by community health teams. Based on prototype matching, it includes
   two structured questions to guide the community health teams in the
   detection and referral process. The tool was acceptable, culturally and
   contextually appropriate, and helpful for the services provided by
   community health teams. Challenges of working in households and the
   importance of self-care were highlighted as important considerations
   when developing training content and piloting the tool. Conclusion:
   Extensive consultation with the KZN DoH, community health teams, and the
   expert mental health panel resulted in developing a tool that was
   perceived to be culturally sensitive and relevant to the community
   package of services.},

Abstract = {People with mental illness are among the most stigmatized and
   discriminated against as a result of lack of knowledge among the public.
   Our study explored adolescents' perceptions of people with mental
   illness through drawings, described these perceptions, and tested the
   possible changes in perceptions after an educational mental health
   intervention. Drawings were collected before and after an educational
   mental health intervention from 59 Greek secondary school students. One
   group of participants served as the experimental group and received the
   educational mental health intervention. Content analysis of the drawings
   was used to analyze data. The drawings provided a clear understanding of
   adolescents' perceptions towards people with mental illness. After the
   educational mental health intervention the negative elements presenting
   the people with mental illness were less among the experimental group,
   while the drawings among the comparison group did not change. The
   findings support that educational mental health intervention can have a
   positive impact on adolescents' perceptions towards people with mental
   illness. Health professionals can use the findings of our study in order
   to develop and implement similar interventions.},

   first aid program},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {13},
Month = {JUN 25},
Abstract = {Psychological first aid programs aim to train lay people to help others
   who are experiencing a mental health crisis or developing mental health
   problems. The current article introduces the new German psychological
   first aid training program HSN. The acronym HSN stands for ``Helfen in
   Seelischer Not{''} (helping in mental distress) but also for the action
   chain ``hear, speak, network.{''} The HSN program differs from other
   well-examined mental health first aid programs by (1) focusing primarily
   on emotions instead of disorders, (2) using a blended approach,
   combining face-to-face and online elements right from the start of the
   project and (3) a low-threshold approach with a course duration of two
   hours. Here we specify the HSN concept and report first results from a
   sample of 150 students. The participating students completed a
   self-report questionnaire before and after the course regarding their
   ``confidence to help.{''} The program demonstrated good feasibility
   without any relevant side effects. On a descriptive level we observed an
   improvement of the averaged values of all questionnaire items after the
   course. These positive initial results merit the further development of
   HSN as a low-threshold psychological first aid program.},

Abstract = {Women are exposed to increased burden of mental disorders during the
   perinatal period: 13-19\% experience postpartum depression. Perinatal
   psychological suffering affects early mother-child relationship,
   impacting child's emotional and cognitive development. Return-to-work
   brings additional vulnerability given the required balance between
   parenting and job demands. The MAternal Mental Health in the WORKplace
   (MAMH@WORK) project aims to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a
   brief and sustainable intervention, promoting (a) maternal mental health
   throughout pregnancy and first 12 months after delivery, and (b) quality
   of mother-child interactions, child emotional self-regulation, and
   cognitive self-control, while (c) reducing perinatal absenteeism and
   presenteeism. MAMH@WORK is a three-arm randomized controlled trial. A
   short-term cognitive-behavioral therapy-based (CBT-based)
   psychoeducation plus biofeedback intervention will be implemented by
   psychiatrists and psychologists, following a standardized procedure
   manual developed after consensus (Delphi method). Participants (n = 225,
   primiparous, singleton pregnant women at 28-30 weeks gestational age,
   aged 18-40 years, employed) will be randomly allocated to arms:
   CBT-based psychoeducation intervention (including mindfulness);
   psychoeducation plus biofeedback intervention; and control. Assessments
   will take place before and after delivery. Main outcomes (and main
   tools): mental health literacy (MHLS), psychological wellbeing (HADS,
   EPDS, KBS, CD-RISC, BRIEF COPE), quality of mother-child interaction,
   child-mother attachment, child emotional self-regulation and cognitive
   self-control (including PBQ, Strange Situation Procedure, QDIBRB,
   SGS-II, CARE-Index), job engagement (UWES), and presenteeism.
   Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses will be conducted; Cohen's
   d coefficient, Cramer's V and odds ratio will be used to assess the
   effect size of the intervention. MAMH@WORK is expected to contribute to
   mental health promotion during the perinatal period and beyond. Its
   results have the potential to inform health policies regarding work-life
   balance and maternal mental health and wellbeing promotion in the
   workplace.},

   Programmes for adolescents in upper secondary schools: A focus group

Abstract = {Accessible Summary What is known on the subject? Mental Health First Aid
   Training Programmes with a pathogenic perspective are implemented
   worldwide for different participants and contexts. These interventions
   can promote the medicalization and psychiatrization movement of human
   suffering. Training programmes should teach about mental health nursing
   problems rather than disorders. However, there seem to be no studies
   describing these healthier interventions targeting adolescents in upper
   secondary schools. Nurses can explore these interventions and target
   them towards these participants and contexts. What the paper adds to
   existing knowledge? The perspective of nurses on the characteristics of
   Mental Health First Aid Training Programmes for adolescents in
   Portuguese upper secondary schools is reported. Experts recognize that
   the nurses who perform these interventions must have personal,
   pedagogical and mental health competencies. Therefore, mental health
   nurses may be considered. The components of mental health literacy,
   mental health nursing problems and a dynamic first aid plan can be
   taught using different classroom training strategies. What are the
   implications for practice? The role of mental health nurses in promoting
   health literacy is highlighted. They have the opportunity to lead
   multidisciplinary teams in using these healthier training programmes.
   These expert opinions can shape the planning, implementation and
   evaluation of these interventions. In turn, training programmes can
   promote the identification, assistance and/or adequate and timely
   referral of people with mental health nursing problems. Introduction
   Mental Health First Aid Training Programmes performed by nurses can
   empower adolescents to aid people with mental health problems. There do
   not appear to be any studies that describe these healthier interventions
   aimed at adolescents in upper secondary schools. The development of
   these educational interventions benefits from the input of their
   participants and facilitators. Aim To explore the perspective of nurses
   about Mental Health First Aid Training Programmes for adolescents in
   upper secondary schools. Method A qualitative, descriptive and
   exploratory study was conducted. Data were collected from seven mental
   health nurses during two focus group sessions. Data were analysed using
   content analysis. Results Twelve themes were identified around nine main
   areas: facilitators, intervention foci, outcomes assessment methods,
   process assessment methods, participants, implementation context,
   duration and frequency, intervention methods and strategies, and
   contents. Discussion Mental health nurses can regularly perform these
   classroom interventions to improve the mental health competencies of
   adolescents. Various educational methods can facilitate learning related
   to mental health literacy components, mental health nursing problems and
   the first aid plan. Valid and appropriate assessment methods enhance a
   good representation of these interventions. Implications for Practice
   This evidence can guide the creation and modelling of these first aid
   training programmes.},

Abstract = {IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICEIncreasing resilience is an important pathway
   through which mental health promotion and prevention programs may
   promote well-being and reduce distressMental health knowledge prior to
   the delivery of mental health literacy does not appear to effect program
   effectivenessAthletes aged from 12 to 18 years of age may benefit
   similarly from the same mental health promotion and prevention programs
   Engaging young men in mental health promotion initiatives is important
   given the negative attitudes toward mental health and increased suicide
   rates, reported by young men. Ahead of the Game (AOTG) is a sport-based,
   psychoeducational initiative which uses sports as a mental health and
   resilience promotional medium. This study sought contribute to the
   literature on the effectiveness of the AOTG program by exploring for
   whom, and through what mechanisms, the intervention works. A secondary
   analysis of the AOTG randomized controlled trial was conducted, which
   comprised a sample of 350 adolescent male sport-playing participants (M
   = 14.53 years, SD = 1.19 years) and control group of 466 sport
   participants (M = 14.66 years, SD = 1.39), various mental health related
   measures were taken at baseline and at approximately 8 weeks follow-up.
   Moderation analyses were conducted to examine age, socioeconomic status,
   and baseline measures of mental health as potential moderators of
   program effects. Mediation analyses were run to explore whether changes
   in psychological distress and wellbeing were mediated by changes in
   AOTG's various primary mental health related outcomes. Results indicated
   age did not moderate any effects of AOTG. Meanwhile, socioeconomic
   status and baseline help seeking, implicit beliefs, and psychological
   distress all showed signs of moderating main effects of AOTG. Mediation
   analyses revealed that changes in resilience and implicit beliefs
   partially mediated changes in psychological distress. Further, increased
   resilience had an indirect effect of on athletes' wellbeing. The
   implications and future directions, in light of these findings, are
   explored. Lay summary: Ahead of the Game was shown to be effective
   regardless of age and particularly beneficial for those in low
   socioeconomic, displaying low levels of help seeking, and those with
   higher psychological distress. Increasing resilience was also shown to
   be an important pathway for increasing wellbeing and reducing distress.},

Title = {Deaf People in Germany: Mental Health Literacy and Perception of Mental

Journal = {VERHALTENSTHERAPIE},

Abstract = {Background: Deaf people encounter numerous barriers as a linguistic
   minority in mental health services. Mental health literacy (MHL), which
   is essential for recognition, treatment, and help-seeking behavior in
   mental disorders, and shapes how people cope with stressors, has not yet
   been studied in deaf people. Material and Methods: Deaf people (n = 390)
   were surveyed online about MHL and perception of mental health services.
   A version of the Mental Health Literacy Questionnaire translated into
   German sign language was used for this purpose. The influence of the
   timepoint of language acquisition and sign language as a natural first
   language on MHL were investigated using Welch tests and Cohen's d.
   Results:The mean age of participants was 32.6 years (SD = 11.0) and a
   large proportion (69\%) described themselves as female. In terms of time
   of deafness, 78.7\% of participants were born deaf/hard of hearing and
   14.1\% became deaf before their fourth birthday. Early language
   acquisition (p > 0.001) and learning a sign language as a first language
   (p = 0.02) were associated with higher levels of MHL. Perception of the
   care system related to various aspects (e.g., involvement in treatment)
   was described. Discussion: MHL in deaf people is increased when early
   language acquisition is given, as well as when sign language was learned
   as a first language. Consequently, societal and health policy efforts
   are necessary to enable early language acquisition and access to sign
   language for deaf infants. As additional measures, possible deficits in
   MHL can be addressed with improved accessibility to mental health
   information. The availability of information materials in sign language
   and improved training for deaf staff and sign language interpreters
   could play an important role in this regard.},

Title = {Depression in the perinatal period: awareness, attitudes and knowledge

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {45},

Abstract = {Objective: To establish a benchmark of awareness, knowledge and
   attitudes in Australia in relation to depression and its treatment in
   the perinatal period, and to identify demographic factors associated
   with perinatal mental health literacy.
   Method: A cross-sectional telephone survey (n == 1201) of a randomly
   selected sample of adults in each State and Territory of Australia,
   conducted in late 2009.
   Results: Depression was the most frequently cited general health problem
   for women after childbirth (43.6\% of spontaneous responses), in
   contrast to previous findings of low awareness of depression generally.
   A total of 94\% of adults believed that postnatal depression requires
   specialized treatment. Older Australians (55 ++ years) identified
   postnatal depression less readily than younger Australians. Although
   well recognized as a specific mental health issue, as a general health
   issue antenatal depression had low recognition and was viewed by 52\% of
   respondents as `'normal''. Community beliefs about perinatal rates of
   depression appeared realistic. Men and women differed in their knowledge
   and beliefs about the symptoms and causes of postnatal depression.
   Difficulty in mother-infant bonding was seen as a common sign of
   postnatal depression, particularly by women. Most commonly, postnatal
   depression was perceived as having a biological rather than psychosocial
   etiology (30\% of men, 41\% of women). Recognition of anxiety in the
   postnatal period was relatively low, although higher among those with
   mental health training. Over 80\% of Australians believed that all new
   mothers should be routinely assessed for depression.
   Conclusions: Awareness of postnatal depression appeared to be at a high
   level in the community, but both anxiety and antenatal depression were
   comparatively under-recognized, suggesting there is considerable scope
   for awareness-raising. Established risk factors for postnatal depression
   were not coherently recognized. Ongoing tracking of perinatal mental
   health literacy in Australia is likely to be valuable in assessing the
   impact of future public awareness efforts.},

Abstract = {In order to manage with the burden of mental health problems in the
   world we need to develop cost-effective and safe preventive
   interventions. Education about resilience to support the ability to cope
   with life challenges in general, may be a useful strategy. We consider

   based on these concepts which can be tailored to specific needs and
   situations in individual therapy as well as group levels. The program
   has shown promising results in pilot studies and is now tested in
   controlled trials in settings such as schools and educational
   institutions, adults diagnosed with ADHD, and children in care.},

Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Coaches' mental health literacy is associated with increased engagement
   in prevention and early intervention behaviors. However, few studies
   have explored the factors that may influence these relationships. The
   purpose of this study was to explore whether role breadth and role
   efficacy mediate the relationship between coach depression literacy and
   prevention and early intervention, and to assess whether gender or
   stigma moderates any mediation effects. One thousand and forty five
   coaches (M = 42.71 years old; SD = 11.52; 30\% female) completed an
   online survey exploring depression literacy, personal stigma, role
   breadth and efficacy and engagement in prevention and early
   intervention. Path analysis was conducted, followed by mediation and
   moderated-mediation analyzes. The overarching model for each behavior
   was confirmed. Role efficacy but not role breadth partially mediated the
   relationship between depression literacy and each behavior. Gender did
   not moderate any mediation relationships. Personal stigma moderated the
   relationship between depression literacy and prevention and early
   intervention. Coaches with lower levels of personal stigma, reported
   higher levels of depression literacy and were more confident to engage
   in prevention and early intervention. Increasing coaches' knowledge and
   confidence may lead to increased engagement in prevention and early
   intervention. However, for coaches with high levels of personal stigma,
   approaches that go beyond the provision of knowledge may be required.
   LAY SUMMARY
   This study explores the relationship between coaches' knowledge of
   depression and their engagement in behaviors that support young people's
   mental health. It also examines how confident coaches feel to engage in
   these behaviors and whether the gender or stigmatizing attitudes of
   coaches might influence these relationships.},

Abstract = {Background: Teenagers are more prone to mobile phone addiction than
   other age groups due to their lack of self-control. This addiction to
   mobile phones severely affects their physical and mental health, causing
   irreversible harm as they grow older. As such, exploring suitable
   psychotherapy for their physical and mental development needs is
   essential, in ways that effectively change teenagers' mobile phone
   addictive behaviors.Methods: An experimental study was conducted on 910
   teenage volunteers recruited from 5 communities in Gansu, Hebei, and
   Liaoning Provinces in China from May to July 2023. The participants were
   screened using the Mobile Phone Addiction Index Scale (MPAI). On the
   basis of the evaluation results, 56 individuals were selected based on
   the evaluation results and randomly divided into experimental and
   control groups, each comprising 28 individuals. The experimental group
   underwent an 8-week mindfulness-based mental health education therapy.
   Both groups were measured before and after the intervention.Results: The
   mobile phone addiction score of the experimental group was significantly
   lower than that of the control group (P<0.001). The cognitive tendency
   score and mental wellbeing score of the experimental group was
   significantly higher than those of the control group
   (P<0.001).Conclusion: Mindfulness-based mental health education therapy
   effectively alleviates teenagers' mobile phone addiction and improves
   their cognitive tendencies and mental health. This approach serves as a
   valuable reference for effectively preventing and managing mobile phone
   addiction among teenagers.},

Journal = {PERSPECTIVES IN PSYCHIATRIC CARE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {2025},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Objectives: Enhancing mental health literacy (MHL) through school-based
   education intervention may encourage mental health promotion,
   prevention, and care and reduce stigma in adolescents. Over the last few
   decades, this has been a major area of interest for researchers and
   health planners. This study aims to explore the relationship between
   knowledge and attitude to mental disorders with students' MHL. Methods:
   This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in 2023 in Sirjan.
   The statistical population included all the students of the first
   secondary schools selected through a multistage cluster random sampling
   method. The study ultimately involved 562 male and female students. Data
   were gathered through a MHL questionnaire, Mental Health Knowledge
   Questionnaire (MHKQ), and Attitudes to Mental Illness Questionnaire
   (AMIQ) along with a demographic information checklist. SPSS and AMOS
   Version 26 software were used in the statistical analysis. Results: The
   findings showed that mental health knowledge has a direct (0.15) and
   indirect (0.36) effect on MHL (p > 0.001). MHL has a direct and
   significant effect on knowledge of risk factors and causes (0.28),
   knowledge of self-treatment (0.15), knowledge of professional help
   available (0.33), and knowledge of where to seek information (0.61).
   Moreover, MHL had a direct and inverse effect on appropriate
   help-seeking behavior (-0.98). Conclusion: This study found that
   individuals with greater MHL exhibit more appropriate behavior and
   knowledge regarding mental illness or disorders. Thus, it is recommended
   that mental health be emphasized in educational programs to help
   students tackle the daily challenges of adolescence.},

Abstract = {Help-seeking is important to access appropriate care and improve mental
   health. However, individuals often delay or avoid seeking help for
   mental health problems. Interventions to improve help-seeking have been
   developed, but their effectiveness is unclear. A systematic review and
   meta-analysis were therefore conducted to examine the effectiveness of
   mental health related help-seeking interventions. Nine databases in
   English, German and Chinese were searched for randomised and
   non-randomised controlled trials. Effect sizes were calculated for
   attitudes, intentions and behaviours to seek formal, informal and
   self-help. Ninety-eight studies with 69 208 participants were included.
   Interventions yielded significant short-term benefits in terms of formal
   help-seeking, self-help, as well as mental health literacy and personal
   stigma. There were also positive long-term effects on formal
   help-seeking behaviours. The most common intervention types were
   strategies to increase mental health literacy, destigmatisation (both
   had positive short-term effects on formal help-seeking behaviours) as
   well as motivational enhancement (with positive long-term effects on
   formal help-seeking behaviours). Interventions improved formal
   help-seeking behaviours if delivered to people with or at risk of mental
   health problems, but not among children, adolescents or the general
   public. There was no evidence that interventions increased the use of
   informal help. Few studies were conducted in low- and middle-income
   countries (LMICs). This study provides evidence for the effectiveness of
   help-seeking interventions in terms of improving attitudes, intentions
   and behaviours to seek formal help for mental health problems among
   adults. Future research should develop effective interventions to
   improve informal help-seeking, for specific target groups and in LMICs
   settings.},

Abstract = {Background/Objective: Recent training and education changes have raised
   important issues in delivery of psychiatric education at all levels. In
   this article, the authors describe the current status of mental health
   education in the training of all doctors and postgraduate training and
   education in psychiatry in the U.K.
   Method: The authors explore and describe some of the initiatives that
   are being used in order to increase exposure to mental health placements
   in the Foundation Program, and they then describe the existing specific
   mental health opportunities within general practice and other specialist
   training programs.
   Description: After graduation from medical school, a two-year Foundation
   training program is a must, and, at the end of the first year, trainees
   become eligible for full registration with the ``regulator,{''} the
   General Medical Council; after finishing the second year, they become
   eligible to undertake specialist training. Psychiatry training takes up
   to 6 years, and six specialties are recognized as leading to
   certificates for completion of training before independent practice.
   These six specialties are 1) general and community; 2) child and
   adolescent; 3) medical psychotherapy; 4) forensic psychiatry; 5)
   psychiatry of old age; and 6) psychiatry of learning disability. Also,
   three subspccialties-liaison psychiatry, addictions, and
   rehabilitation-form a part of the training in general and community
   psychiatry.
   Conclusions: The authors discuss advantages and disadvantages of such an
   approach and raise key issues related to ongoing work to improve
   recruitment, progression, and retention of trainee psychiatrists.},

Title = {Virtual reality for experiential learning: enhancing agitation
   management skills, confidence, and empathy in healthcare students},
Journal = {MEDICAL EDUCATION ONLINE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {30},

Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {Agitation in healthcare, particularly in psychiatric settings, is a
   prevalent and escalating global concern. Despite its significance,
   healthcare students often feel underprepared to manage agitation, citing
   fear, stigma, and limited clinical exposure. Traditional teaching
   methods, such as lectures or simulations, are resource-intensive and
   offer limited opportunities for repeated practice in low-risk
   environments. Virtual reality (VR) offers a promising alternative,
   providing immersive, standardised, and repeatable training for
   high-stress clinical scenarios. In response, the education team at
   {[}redacted for peer review], developed the Managing AGgression using
   Immersive Content (MAGIC) programme. This three-hour blended learning
   workshop, a mandatory component of the psychiatry curriculum for medical
   and nursing students, integrates didactic teaching, role-play, and the
   Virtual Reality in Agitation Management (VRAM) activity. Through
   experiential learning, MAGIC aims to enhance healthcare students'
   confidence, empathy, mental health literacy, and competence in managing
   agitation in psychiatric healthcare settings. Using a pre- and post-test
   quasi-experimental design, we evaluated the programme's effectiveness
   among 152 medical and nursing students. Results demonstrated significant
   improvements in mental health literacy, self-perceived proficiency, and
   confidence in managing agitated patients; there was also a marked
   reduction in stigma towards individuals with mental health conditions.
   In addition, participants responded positively to all aspects of the
   VRAM software, underscoring its usability and educational value. These
   findings highlight the potential of integrating immersive VR technology
   with traditional pedagogical methods to transform healthcare education
   by fostering deeper engagement, enhancing clinical competence, and
   ultimately improving patient outcomes.},

Title = {WeARTolerance: Evaluating the impact of an arts-based program to reduce
   mental health-related stigma in young people},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {19},

Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {The stigma surrounding mental health remains a significant barrier to
   help-seeking and well-being in youth populations. The invisibility of
   mental health issues highlights the critical need for improved knowledge
   and stigma reduction, underscoring the urgency of tackling this issue.
   Arts-based interventions have shown promise in addressing stigma, yet
   comprehensive longitudinal studies in community settings are limited.
   This research evaluates the ``WeARTolerance'' arts-based program in
   reducing mental health stigma among diverse youths. The program
   integrated psychoeducational and creative activities (e.g., visual arts,
   cinema, music, and theatre) to explore mental health themes, with 125
   teenagers and young adult participants (M = 13.70; SD = 2.06). The
   present mixed-method study was split into two phases with complementary
   objectives: 1) evaluate quantitatively the program's impact in reducing
   social stigma and related outcomes; 2) explore in-depth qualitative
   feedback about the program. For the first phase, reliable self-report
   questionnaires were used to measure mental health knowledge, social
   stigma, intergroup anxiety, and social distance in pre-, post-, and
   6-month follow-up periods. Participants' age and past psychiatric issues
   were fixed factors with random intercepts, and mixed effects models were
   used to analyze the attitudinal outcomes across time. In the second
   phase of this validation, nine teenagers aged between 12 and 16
   participated in two focus groups conducted three months after the
   program. Its contents underwent thorough analysis using content analysis
   techniques. The quantitative results from Phase 1 demonstrated a
   decreasing trend in all primary outcomes. In phase 2, participants
   acknowledged the activities' relevance, reported overall satisfaction
   with the program, and showed great enthusiasm and willingness to learn
   more. Arts-based interventions like ``WeARTolerance{''} are valuable for
   challenging stigma and fostering understanding in youth populations and
   provide an alternative and creative way to increase mental health
   literacy. The study proposes a program to reduce youth mental health
   stigma through arts-based elements, early intervention, and
   psychoeducation, involving collaborations between professionals and
   artists to promote youth engagement. Future studies should include
   indirect social contact and randomized controlled interventions.},

Abstract = {Background A teen Mental Health First Aid training course for high
   school students in years 10-12 (tMHFA 10-12) has previously been
   evaluated in uncontrolled and randomized controlled trials and found to
   improve Mental Health First Aid intentions, mental health literacy and
   to reduce stigma. This 3 x 75-min course has more recently been adapted
   for younger students in years 7-9 (tMHFA 7-9). The present study reports
   an initial uncontrolled trial of this new training course which aimed to
   assess feasibility and acceptability of the course and test effects on
   knowledge, attitudes and behaviour. Methods An uncontrolled trial was
   carried out in five schools with measures taken at pre-test, post-test
   and 3-month follow-up. The outcomes measured were: quality of first aid
   intentions to help peers, confidence in helping, stigmatising attitudes,
   recognition of anxiety disorder, number of adults thought to be helpful,
   help-seeking intentions, quality of support provided to a peer, quality
   of support received, and psychological distress. Questions were also
   asked about satisfaction with the course. Results There were 475
   students (mean age 13.86 years) who provided data at baseline, with 76\%
   of these providing data at post-test and 75\% at follow-up. Sustained
   changes at follow-up were found for: number of adults thought to be
   helpful, some components of stigma, recognition of anxiety disorder, and
   quality of support provided to a peer. However, there was an unexpected
   decline in willingness to tell others about a mental health problem.
   Most students found the information presented to be new, easy to
   understand, and useful. Conclusions The tMHFA 7-9 training course
   produced some positive changes that were sustained over 3 months.
   However, the changes were not as strong as previously found for older
   high school students, suggesting the need for further refinement of the
   course.},

Title = {Adolescent mental health education InSciEd Out: a case study of an
   alternative middle school population},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {16},
Month = {APR 3},
Abstract = {Background: Mental illness contributes substantially to global disease
   burden, particularly when illness onset occurs during youth and
   help-seeking is delayed and/or limited. Yet, few mental health promotion
   interventions target youth, particularly those with or at high risk of
   developing mental illness ({''}at-risk{''} youth). Community-based
   translational research has the capacity to identify and intervene upon
   barriers to positive health outcomes. This is especially important for
   integrated care in at-risk youth populations.
   Methods: Here the Integrated Science Education Outreach (InSciEd Out)
   program delivered a novel school-based anti-stigma intervention in
   mental health to a cohort of seventh and eighth grade at-risk students.
   These students were assessed for changes in mental health knowledge,
   stigmatization, and help-seeking intentions via a classroom activity,
   surveys, and teacher interviews. Descriptive statistics and Cohen's d
   effect sizes were employed to assess pre-post changes. Inferential
   statistical analyses were also conducted on pilot results to provide a
   benchmark to inform future studies.
   Results: Elimination of mental health misconceptions (substance weakness
   p = 0.00; recovery p = 0.05; prevention p = 0.05; violent p = 0.05) was
   accompanied by slight gains in mental health literacy (d = 0.18) and
   small to medium improvements in help-seeking intentions (anxiety d =
   0.24; depression d = 0.48; substance d = 0.43; psychosis d = 0.53).
   Within this particular cohort of students, stigma was exceptionally low
   at baseline and remained largely unchanged. Teacher narratives revealed
   positive teacher views of programming, increased student openness to
   talk about mental illness, and higher peer and self-acceptance of mental
   health diagnoses and help-seeking.
   Conclusions: Curricular-based efforts focused on mental illness in an
   alternative school setting are feasible and integrated well into general
   curricula under the InSciEd Out framework. Preliminary data suggest the
   existence of unique help-seeking barriers in at-risk youth. Increased
   focus upon community-based programming has potential to bridge gaps in
   translation, bringing this critical population to clinical care in
   pursuit of improved mental health for all.},

Title = {What Do Parents Know and Perceive About Child and Adolescent Psychiatry
   and Treatments?},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {85},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Purpose: Parents' knowledge, understanding and attitudes have a strong
   influence on treatment outcomes in child and adolescent psychiatry
   (CAP). However, little is known about parents' knowledge, perceptions
   and awareness regarding assessment, intervention and treatment options
   in CAP. Methods: We evaluated 1872 parents (1104 mothers {[}59.0\%], 768
   fathers {[}41.0\%]) who were over 18 years of age and had at least one
   child between the ages of 0-18, regardless of whether their child had
   previously received CAP treatment, using a questionnaire containing 29
   questions. Results: The most common misconceptions about CAP application
   records were that psychiatric records would cause difficulties in
   getting a job (92.6\%) and would be obstacles to appointment to civil
   service (65.8\%) and to getting driver's licence (34.8\%). Regarding CAP
   drug treatments, the most frequently reported false beliefs were that
   psychiatric drugs cause weight gain (80.1\%), are addictive (65.1\%),
   cause long-lasting side effects (53.5\%), numb the mind and cause
   drowsiness (52.7\%), alter children's personalities (44.4\%) and
   increase suicide risk (42.9\%). Furthermore, 1105 (59.0\%) participants
   answered `Psychiatric disorders cannot be treated effectively even if
   psychiatric medications are used.' Conclusions: Our results indicated
   that parents' knowledge level was inadequate, and their attitudes and
   beliefs were negative and limited regarding CAP and treatments; in turn,
   they avoided treatment and did not engage in help-seeking behaviours.
   This study shows an urgent need for mental health education programs to
   increase parents' awareness and understanding of CAP and promote
   appropriate access to services.},

Abstract = {Background: The majorities of individual suffering from eating disorders
   do not seek or receive adequate professional treatment. Internet-based
   approaches promise to facilitate access to conventional healthcare by
   providing an easy-access, low-threshold contact.Aim: The current study
   investigated whether an Internet-based program for the prevention and
   early intervention for eating disorders (ProYouth) may contribute to the
   actual and intended uptake of professional care. Characteristics of
   individuals who seek help are explored as well as barriers to
   help-seeking.Method: The sample included 453 ProYouth participants who
   were surveyed three months after registration. Actual help-seeking
   behavior, intended help-seeking, potential help-seeking, and barriers to
   help-seeking were assessed.Results: Within three months of
   participation, 43 individuals (9.5\%) took up treatment, 32 (7.8\%)
   intended to start treatment, and 163 (43.1\%) of the remaining reported
   that they would seek professional help in case of need (potential
   help-seeking). Approximately 50\% of (potential) help-seekers stated
   that participation in ProYouth has changed their attitude towards
   help-seeking. Mental health literacy and shame/stigma were the most
   frequently mentioned barriers.Conclusions: This is the first study
   indicating that an online program for prevention and early intervention
   may serve as facilitator in accessing conventional healthcare.},

Abstract = {BackgroundSchool-based mental health promotion aims to strengthen mental
   health and reduce stress. Results on the effectiveness of such programs
   are heterogeneous. This study realized a school-based mental health
   promotion program (StresSOS) for all students and aimed to identify
   moderators (mental health status, gender, grade level) of pre- to
   post-changes in stress symptoms and knowledge. MethodsParticipants were
   N = 510 adolescents (from 29 classes; 46.7\% female) aged 12-18 years (M
   = 13.88, SD = 1.00; grade levels 7-10). They were without mental health
   problems (65.9\%), at risk for mental health problems (21.6\%), or with
   mental health problems (12.5\%) and participated in a 90 min per week
   face-to-face training with 8 sessions in class at school. Demographic
   variables, mental health status, stress symptoms, and knowledge about
   stress and mental health were collected at baseline. Program acceptance,
   stress symptoms, and knowledge were collected post-intervention.
   Multilevel mixed effects models were conducted with the fixed effects
   time (within factor), mental health status, gender, and grade level
   (between factors). Random effects for students within classes were
   included. ResultsIn the pre-post comparison, mental health status
   moderated the changes on psychological stress symptoms (p < 0.05). In
   adolescents with mental health problems the largest reduction in stress
   symptoms was observed between pre- and post-assessment. Gender and grade
   level were less relevant. For all adolescents knowledge gains were
   revealed (p < 0.001). Program acceptance was moderated by mental health
   status and grade level (p < 0.01). Mentally healthy adolescents and
   within the group of adolescents at-risk or with mental health problems,
   especially younger students (7(th)/8(th) grade), rated program
   acceptance higher. ConclusionPsychological stress symptoms decreased
   among adolescents with mental health problems and not among adolescents
   at risk for or without mental health problems. Mental health-related
   knowledge increased for all adolescents. The results add to knowledge on
   school-based mental health intervention research and practice. Its
   implications for different prevention strategies (universal, selective
   or a combination of both) are discussed.},

Title = {The service needs of mothers with schizophrenia: a qualitative study of

Journal = {GENERAL HOSPITAL PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {30},
Number = {2},
Pages = {177-184},
Month = {MAR-APR},
Abstract = {Objective: The study sought to (1) understand the perspectives of
   perinatal psychiatric and antenatal health service workers on the
   service and support needs of mothers with schizophrenia; (2) obtain
   their views on the feasibility and potential effectiveness of a proposed
   parenting intervention tailored for this group.
   Method: Twenty-eight perinatal psychiatry and antenatal service workers
   were interviewed using a semi-structured methodology, and anonymised
   verbatim transcripts analysed for content themes.
   Results: Many respondents felt that women with schizophrenia received
   insufficient postnatal support. Perceived needs were: support with
   adjustment/coping; parenting skills and sensitivity training;
   maintaining mental health; continuity of care and community support; and
   encouraging bonding. Service integration/continuity and social stigma
   were recurring themes that impacted on recommendations, such as the need
   for interdisciplinary communication and mental health education for
   midwives. The parenting program was generally well received, although
   many raised concerns regarding patient involvement and specific
   intervention characteristics.
   Conclusion: The views of health workers are a valuable complement to the
   service user perspective. They highlight the needs of this high-risk
   group in their transition to motherhood, and how they might be met, as
   well as a need for staff training so that parenting interventions are
   better understood as positive prevention work. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {Refugee children are less likely than their non-refugee peers to receive
   timely diagnoses and treatment for mental and/or behavioral health
   problems, despite facing multiple risk factors including potential
   exposure to trauma during premigration, migration, and postmigration
   experiences. Social-Emotional Learning offers preventive mental health
   education for children through well-established, evidenced-based
   curricula. Although there are clear benefits of Social-Emotional
   Learning curricula, which can help children achieve long-term success
   emotionally and academically, Social-Emotional Learning curricula are
   not easily accessible for refugee children, often because of language
   and socioeconomic barriers. In this pilot study, we evaluated the
   feasibility and acceptability of an adapted Social-Emotional Learning
   program that included culturally specific, multilingual, trauma-informed
   wellness, and physical education during the COVID-19 pandemic: EMPOWER
   (Emotions Program Outside the Clinic With Wellness Education for
   Refugees). We used the Intervention Mapping framework which guided the
   (1) planning, (2) program development, and (3) mixed-method evaluation
   of the feasibility and acceptability of the EMPOWER pilot. We found that
   this adaptation was well-received by Afghan refugee families and that
   COVID-19 safety measures were well-understood after participation.
   Challenges emerged around videoconferencing connectivity and around
   finding a common language for discussing emotions. Future iterations of
   the program and evaluations will require continued partnerships with
   community members and organizations. As we continue and expand EMPOWER,
   we aim to evaluate short-term improvement in Social-Emotional Learning
   competence as well as long-term mental and behavioral health outcomes
   for children and their families.},

Abstract = {Immigrant-origin youth (IOY) are a growing population within the United
   States with a high risk of mental health challenges as a consequence of
   unique stressors and risk factors, disparities in access to mental
   health services, and disproportionate distress associated with the
   COVID-19 pandemic. This study examined the effectiveness, utility,
   acceptability, and cultural fit of the virtual Youth Mental Health First
   Aid (YMHFA) training program for school staff who work with IOY.
   Educators and school staff working predominantly with IOY (n = 36)
   attended a standard virtual YMHFA, completed surveys at pretraining,
   posttraining, and 3-month follow-up, and participated in virtual focus
   groups at posttraining. Results revealed significant improvements in
   mental health knowledge (d = .48), confidence to help (d = .70), and
   attitudes toward mental illness (d = .35) that were sustained at 3-month
   follow-up. The content and format of the virtual training was highly
   rated in its utility and acceptability. Qualitative themes related to
   virtual YMFHA's general utility and acceptability, perceptions of its
   cultural relevance, and recommendations to improve the cultural
   relevance of YMHFA were identified. Based on these results, several
   implications for implementation of YMHFA training in schools, improving
   the training's cultural relevance for helping IOY in schools, and future
   directions in research are discussed.},

Abstract = {Objective This article describes survey results from child and
   adolescent psychiatry (CAP) fellowship program directors regarding
   attitudes of their programs' capacity to effectively educate fellows on
   the social determinants of mental health and program directors'
   perceived importance of doing so. Methods A survey asking about six
   topics within the social determinants of mental health was disseminated
   to all CAP program directors with email addresses found in the
   Fellowship and Residency Electronic Interactive Database (FREIDA) (n=
   134). Data were exported using the Qualtrics survey platform. Results
   Fifty-three program directors (40\%) responded to the survey. Overall,
   98\% of program directors felt education on the social determinants of
   mental health was ``essential{''} for fellowship training, but there
   were significant differences in perceived relative importance and
   effectiveness of education provided across topics. Familial factors were
   rated as significantly more important than structural, historical, and
   economic factors. Structural and historical factors were viewed as being
   taught less effectively than other factors. Educational, structural, and
   historical factors and neighborhood factors were allotted significantly
   less instructional time than familial factors. Conclusions While there
   is near-universal consensus that social determinants of mental health
   education are critical for fellowship training, program directors feel
   that social determinants of mental health topics differ in importance
   and are taught at varying levels of effectiveness. These findings
   highlight the need for intra-institutional and or inter-institutional
   collaboration for social determinants of mental health educational
   content development if CAP programs are to prepare trainees to best
   serve their most vulnerable patients.},

Abstract = {BackgroundTwo of the most common modifiable barriers to help-seeking for
   mental health problems during adolescence are stigma and poor mental
   health literacy. However, relatively little is known about stigma as it
   relates to suicide, and knowledge about suicidality in this age
   group.AimsTo assess levels of suicide literacy and suicide attitudes in
   an adolescent sample, and to identify correlates of these
   constructs.MethodsData were drawn from the pre-intervention survey of
   the Sources of Strength Australia Project. A total of 1019 adolescents
   aged between 11 and 17 years participated. Suicide literacy and
   attitudes were measured alongside potential correlates including
   psychological distress, suicidal ideation, mastery, previous exposure to
   suicidal thinking and behaviour, and demographics.ResultsParticipants
   more strongly endorsed attitudes attributing suicide to
   isolation/depression, compared to attitudes glorifying or stigmatising
   suicide. Gaps in knowledge about suicide included the risk factors,
   signs and symptoms. Key correlates of suicide attitudes and literacy
   included age, gender and cultural background.ConclusionFindings
   highlight the need for further education activities in schools and
   public awareness campaigns that address the gaps in suicide knowledge
   and attitudes. Such activities would assist in the identification of
   suicide risk among young people and improve help-seeking in this
   population.},

Abstract = {PurposeDrug prevention programs typically focus on providing information
   on the effects of drugs and developing refusal skills. However, there is
   evidence that adolescents use substances to cope with stress. As such,
   integrating mental health literacy is important in prevention programs.
   The purpose of this study was to test a video-based mental health and
   substance prevention program for Filipino
   youth.Design/methodology/approachThe study used a cluster randomized
   trial and mixed methods design with 623 Filipino adolescents from 12 to
   18 years old. The program consisted of six sessions focusing on stress,
   adaptive coping, effects of substances and drug refusal skills. It uses
   short psychoeducation videos along with self-reflection, and discussions
   to increase learner engagement.FindingsResults revealed a significant
   increase in knowledge and negative attitudes toward substance of
   participants in the intervention group compared to the control group.
   Those in the intervention group reported improved use of adaptive coping
   skills particularly cognitive reappraisal, social support,
   problem-solving and relaxation compared to the control
   group.Originality/valueThis study adds to the literature on prevention
   from under-represented and non-Western contexts such as the Philippines.
   This study highlights how technology-mediated and integrated mental
   health and substance use programs can be useful in countries with few
   resources for mental health.},

Abstract = {There is an urgent need for improved school-based mental health services
   to address students' increasing mental health needs. School nurses are
   often at the frontlines of youth mental health, but report feeling
   unprepared to manage student needs due to limited training. We conducted
   a rapid review to identify evidence-based mental health educational
   interventions for school nurses and evaluate program characteristics.
   Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. While the literature
   evaluating mental health training programs for school nurses is limited,
   it suggests that training may improve school nurse knowledge,
   confidence, and preparedness to address student mental health needs and
   improve the management of student mental health. Additionally, it
   highlighted the importance of support, resources, and policies that
   foster mental health promotion. Future research should focus on
   obtaining a current assessment of school nurse mental health education
   needs, evaluating existing interventions, and developing more
   evidence-based mental health training programs for school nurses.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF SCHOOL HEALTH},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: teen Mental Health First Aid (tMHFA) is an Australian
   school-based universal program for grade 10 to 12 students. tMHFA
   teaches teens how to recognize and respond to a peer in crisis or
   experiencing mental health concerns.
   METHODS: Schools implementing tMHFA in 2019 and 2020 were propensity
   score matched, yielding a sample of instructors (n= 130) and students
   (n= 1915) in 44 high schools in 24 American states. Effectiveness and
   acceptability were assessed with student surveys at baseline and after
   implementation.
   RESULTS: There were significant findings for primary outcomes, including
   improved helpful first aid intentions (Cohen ds= 0.57 to 0.58),
   confidence supporting a peer (ds= 0.19 to 0.31); the number of adults
   rated as helpful (ds= 0.37 to 0.44); and reductions in stigmatizing
   beliefs (ds= 0.21 to 0.40) and `'harmful first aid intentions'' (ds=
   0.11 to 0.42). Instructors and students rated the program favorably with
   students sharing improvements on their recognition and responses to
   mental health problems and crises.
   CONCLUSION: tMHFA is an effective, feasible, and scalable training
   program for increasing mental health literacy and decreasing mental
   health stigma in adolescents in the short term, consistent with trials
   of tMHFA in Australian adolescents.},

Abstract = {Objectives: To determine the effects of gender on mental health literacy
   in young people between 12 and 25 years of age. Design:
   Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing was employed to conduct a
   cross-sectional structured interview focusing on young people's
   awareness of depression and psychosis.
   Participants: The sample comprised 1207 young Australians (539 males and
   668 females) between the ages of 12-25 recruited from two metropolitan
   and two regional areas within Victoria. Six hundred and six respondents
   were presented a depression vignette and 601 were presented a psychosis
   vignette.
   Results: Female respondents (60.7\%) were significantly more likely to
   correctly identify depression in the vignette as compared to male
   respondents (34.5\%). No significant gender differences were noted for
   the psychosis vignette. Males were less significantly likely to endorse
   seeing a doctor or psychologist/counsellor for the treatment of
   psychosis. Males were also significantly more likely than females to
   endorse alcohol as a way of dealing with depression and antibiotics as
   useful for dealing with psychosis.
   Conclusion: Gender differences in mental health literacy are striking.
   Males showed significantly lower recognition of symptoms associated with
   mental illness and were more likely endorse the use alcohol to deal with
   mental health problems. Such factors may contribute to the delays in
   help seeking seen in young males. Further research is needed to
   delineate how these gender differences in young people may obstruct help
   seeking, early intervention and other aspects of mental health service
   delivery.},

Abstract = {Group psychological training is a kind of important education method
   which rises in China's colleges and Universities in recent years, it can
   strengthen the students' confidence and enhance their physical and
   mental health and optimize their quality in the psychological, ideology
   and morality, and behavior quality. In our country, there is a good
   reason for the implementation of the students' group psychological
   training, which can not only break the traditional teaching education
   thinking mode ``teacher teaching{''}, but also make higher vocational
   students acquire knowledge in a relaxed and happy state. More important
   is the expansion of the implementation of mental health education.
   Therefore, this study mainly takes Chongqing Vocational Institute of
   Engineering as an example, based on the psychological behavior problems
   of students in this school to develop a targeted student group
   psychological training program, to open a group of psychological
   training elective courses to carry out training practice, seek the
   promotion way on students' interpersonal skills, cooperation ability and
   future career development ability.},

Title = {EFFECT OF SOLUTION-FOCUSED BRIEF THERAPY-BASED ON EXERCISE PRESCRIPTION
   INTERVENTION ON ADOLESCENT MENTAL HEALTH},

Abstract = {Background: Considering the serious negative impact of depressive
   disorder on adolescent mental health, this study explored the effect of
   solution-focused brief therapy (SFBT)-based exercise prescription on
   adolescent mental health-specifically depression, anxiety, and sleep
   quality. Method: A total of 144 adolescent patients with depression who
   were treated in three third-grade first-class (3A) general hospitals in
   Zhejiang Province from January to September 2016 were selected for the
   intervention experiment and divided into the control group, conventional
   psychological intervention group, and SFBT-based exercise prescription
   intervention group, with 48 patients in each group. The control group
   received ordinary mental health education from their school's mental
   health teacher. The conventional psychological intervention group
   received targeted clinical counseling according to their psychological
   evaluation. The SFBT-based exercise prescription intervention group
   received intervention in accordance with the exercise prescription
   developed on the basis of solution-focused brief therapy. Results: After
   six months of intervention, the SAS, SDS, and PSQI scores decreased in
   all three groups (P < 0.05). The exercise prescription intervention
   group showed the greatest decreases in all three scores, followed by the
   conventional intervention group (P < 0.05). Conclusions: SFBT-based
   exercise prescription intervention is highly effective at reducing
   anxiety and depression in adolescents and can significantly improve
   adolescents' sleep quality among adolescents. At the same time,
   SFBT-based exercise prescription intervention can lead to the decline of
   anxiety level and the improvement of sleep quality while improving
   students' depression. This study provides new ideas and methods for
   adolescent mental health intervention.},

Title = {Improving Work Ability of Mentally Burdened Emerging Adults in
   Vocational Integration Programs: A Study Protocol},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUN 19},
Abstract = {Background: Emerging adults who do not successfully transition from
   compulsory education to the upper secondary level have a greater risk of
   developing mental illness than their working peers. Early intervention
   is important in these cases; the course of an illness can be positively
   influenced if treated early and without delay, and consequently, the
   illness will not affect the professional and personal development of the
   emerging adults any further. Postponing treatment of a mental illness
   increases the risk of chronification of the disease. Up to now,
   vocational integration programs have been mostly educationally oriented.
   To recognize and treat mental illness in a timely way, we developed an
   intervention that includes psychotherapy support in a vocational
   integration program for emerging adults who have not successfully
   transitioned from compulsory education to the upper secondary level.
   Aim: The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of the
   described intervention, which will be delivered to all emerging adults
   aged 16-29 entering the vocational integration program. Another
   objective is to determine if it is worthwhile and feasible to proceed
   with testing the intervention in a full-scale clinical trial. Conducting
   research with this population can be very difficult, which makes it
   especially important to test the feasibility of a clinical trial.
   Methods: A single group clinical trial will be conducted to examine the
   effectiveness of the intervention described above. Emerging adults aged
   16-29 entering a vocational integration program will be recruited.
   Participants will provide informed consent and complete pre-intervention
   measures; they then take part in the intervention group in addition to
   the regular vocational integration program. The primary outcomes for
   this study are an increase in work ability, mental health literacy, and
   mental health. Demographic information, vocational biography, and
   satisfaction with the intervention will also be collected. Questionnaire
   data will be collected at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and
   6-month follow-up.
   Ethics and dissemination: The study was approved by the Ethics Committee
   of the Canton of Zurich (2017-00936) and registered in
   https://clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03328286) before recruitment started. The
   results will be reported in future scientific publications and
   international conference presentations.},

Title = {Improvements in Literacy, Stigmatic Views, and Microaggressions Towards
   Mental Illness for Undergraduate Criminal Justice Majors},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUN 6},
Abstract = {Mental illness impacts billions, globally. While mental illness does not
   predict criminality, many individuals with mental health needs find
   themselves within the various decision points of the criminal legal
   system. Research shows that individuals experiencing a mental health
   challenge and/or crisis are at greater risk for a law enforcement
   encounter, police use-of-forth, detainment in jail, and court and
   correctional system involvement. Yet, research has found that increased
   knowledge surrounding mental illness can reduce negative criminal legal
   system involvement. As such, the current sample included undergraduate
   criminal justice students enrolled in an elective course that included
   Mental Health First Aid (MHFA)-an evidence-based intervention training.
   In the current study, MHFA was part of the course curriculum. Enrolled
   students completed both a pre- and post-test questionnaire (at the
   beginning and end of the course) to measure changes in their mental
   illness literacy for depression, mental illness stigma, and mental
   illness microaggressions. Results support the implementation of MHFA to
   undergraduate criminal justice students, as students had an increase in
   mental illness literacy, and decreases in mental illness stigma and
   microaggressions. These findings encourage more colleges and
   universities to offer MHFA to promote peer support as well as
   professional knowledge for those who will work within the criminal legal
   system.},

Abstract = {Background: Childhood and adolescence are critical periods for mental
   health development, with a significant risk for mental disorders. The
   Chinese government has prioritized student health and well-being,
   encouraging policies to support youth mental health. However, challenges
   remain due to high technical demands and inter-departmental
   coordination. Methods: The ``pathway through care{''} model connects
   hospitals, schools, communities, and families to collaboratively promote
   adolescent mental health. The model employs general screening,
   interviews, and intervention strategies at various levels, including
   mental health promotion and training for students, educators, and
   parents. The model's operation is led by a tertiary care team in
   collaboration with school districts. Results: Since the implementation
   of the model in Chongqing, a large-scale screening of students has been
   conducted, with over 330,000 students screened and a significant number
   receiving face-to-face interviews with psychiatrists/psychologists. The
   model has facilitated the early identification of students at risk,
   appropriate referrals for care, and ongoing support within the school
   setting. It has also engaged parents and the wider community in
   addressing youth mental health needs. Conclusions: The
   ``Hospital-School-Home-Community{''} integrated mental health service
   model has demonstrated success in improving child and youth mental
   health within the school setting in Chongqing. It has effectively linked
   education and health systems to address a full continuum of care.},

Abstract = {In a 5-year follow-up assessment, 33 students who had taken an
   undergraduate helping skills course indicated that they had continued to
   use the helping skills in both their professional lives and personal
   relationships. On average, there were no significant changes from
   pretraining to follow-up on empathy, natural helping ability, or
   facilitative interpersonal skills. Furthermore, although students had
   increased in self-efficacy for using the skills during training, on
   average they maintained their self-efficacy levels at the follow-up. The
   15 participants who had further mental health education, however, scored
   higher at follow-up on empathy, natural helping ability, self-efficacy
   for using the skills, and facilitative interpersonal skills compared
   with the 18 participants who had no further mental health education
   (controlling for pretraining levels), suggesting that continued exposure
   to and practice using the skills helped them continue to improve their
   helping abilities. Qualitative data indicated that participants
   typically had positive experiences in the helping skills course.
   Implications for training and research are provided.},

Title = {Parental understanding of mental health in young children: The
   development and initial validation of the parental child mental health
   literacy questionnaire},
Journal = {MENTAL HEALTH \& PREVENTION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {37},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Aims: Parental understanding of mental health difficulties in young
   children is crucial for early intervention and support, yet child mental
   health is often misconceived and stigmatized. The Parental Child Mental
   Health Literacy Questionnaire (PCMHLQ) was developed to measure parents'
   literacy of child mental health and piloted in a general community
   sample of parents in the UK. Subjects and methods: The measure was
   developed in a three-stage process and piloted in 211 parents of
   children aged 4 - 11 years. Factor structure, convergent validity, and
   construct validity were assessed. Results: The final 23-item version
   produced a five-factor model corresponding to (1) beliefs, (2) fear of
   stigma or shame, (3) help-seeking confidence, (4) recognition, and (5)
   knowledge related to young children's mental health. Four factors had
   acceptable to high internal reliability. Total PCMHLQ was associated
   with adult mental health literacy and physical health literacy scores.
   PCMHLQ scores were lower for parents with a child with mental health
   difficulties, parents with current mental health difficulties, fathers,
   and low-income parents. Non- White ethnic minority parents held more
   negative child mental health beliefs, but did not differ in other
   scales, and parents who had a history of mental health service access
   had higher recognition but lower help-seeking confidence. Conclusion:
   This paper describes the first integrated measure of parental literacy
   in young children's mental health. Preliminary evidence suggests that
   the 23-item PCMHLQ has the potential to identify parents with low
   understanding and to inform tailored community-based interventions and
   public health initiatives.},

Abstract = {Background Mental health literacy (MHL) is a crucial concept in mental
   health because it promotes positive mental health outcomes and behaviors
   across various demographics, including adolescents.Aims This study
   utilized the MHLS-Arabic-Adolescents tool to investigate MHL among
   Palestinian adolescents in Israel, aiming to explore its significance in
   determining intentions to seek formal and informal mental health help
   separately.Methods A cohort of 172 adolescents (with a mean age of 16.25
   +/- 1.25 years, comprising 64\% females) completed assessments measuring
   their intention for both formal and informal help-seeking, levels of
   psychological distress, MHL, and various sociodemographic and clinical
   characteristics. This study uses the same dataset from previous research
   on formal help-seeking, with an expanded focus on informal help-seeking
   and MHL using an adapted tool.Results Participants reported medium to
   high levels of MHL factors, demonstrating stronger intentions to seek
   informal help compared to formal. ``Knowledge of where to seek
   information{''} and ``Attitude toward mental illness{''} emerged as the
   significant MHL factors determining formal help-seeking intentions,
   whereas `attitudes toward mental illness' was identified as the sole
   determinant of intentions to seek informal help.Conclusions This study
   highlights the importance of MHL factors in shaping adolescents'
   intentions to seek formal and informal mental health help. It emphasizes
   the need to strengthen informal support networks, improve adolescents'
   attitudes toward mental illness, and facilitate access to mental health
   information. These insights offer valuable guidance for intervention
   programs aimed at promoting both formal and informal help-seeking
   behaviors among Palestinian Arab adolescents in Israel and similar
   groups.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveThe ability to assess a patient's risk of harm to self or
   others is a core competency for mental health clinicians which can have
   significant patient outcomes. With the growth of simulation in medical
   education, there is an opportunity to enhance education outcomes for
   psychiatric risk assessment. The purpose of this study was to determine
   how simulation is used to build competency in risk assessment and map
   its educational outcomes.MethodsThe authors conducted a systematic
   scoping review using the Arksey and O'Malley framework. Electronic
   database searches were conducted by an academic librarian. Studies
   published before August 2022 which described simulation activities aimed
   at training clinicians in suicide, self-harm, and/or violence risk
   assessment were screened for eligibility.ResultsOf the 21,814 articles
   identified, 58 studies were selected for inclusion. The majority
   described simulations teaching suicide risk assessment, and there was a
   notable gap for building competency in violence risk assessment.
   Simulation utility was demonstrated across emergency, inpatient, and
   outpatient settings involving adult and pediatric care. The most common
   simulation modality was patient actors. A smaller subset implemented
   technological approaches, such as automated virtual patient avatars.
   Outcomes included high learner satisfaction, and increases in
   psychiatric risk assessment knowledge, competency, and
   performance.ConclusionSimulation as an adjuvant to existing medical
   curricula can be used to teach risk assessment in mental health. Based
   on the results of our review, the authors provide recommendations for
   medical educators looking to design and implement simulation in mental
   health education.},

Title = {Mental health literacy about depression and schizophrenia among
   adolescents in Sweden},
Journal = {EUROPEAN PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {28},
Number = {7},
Pages = {404-411},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background: Mental health literacy (MHL) refers to an individual's
   knowledge of mental disorders, including the ability to recognize
   psychopathology and being aware of help options. Most studies of MHL
   have focused on adults.
   Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine levels of MHL among
   adolescents.
   Methods: MHL was examined using two pre-established vignettes that
   presented an adolescent with symptoms of either depression or
   schizophrenia. The respondents were 426 adolescents (age mean = 16).
   Vignette data were analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively.
   Results: The data showed that 42.7\% and 34.7\% of the respondents
   identified depression and schizophrenia, respectively. Depression was
   recognized more often by females than males. Professional help was
   suggested by a minority of the respondents for managing symptoms of
   depression (22.5\%) or schizophrenia (32.6\%). Altruistic behaviors,
   examined through the willingness to help an acquaintance with mental
   illness symptoms, were apparent among 58.2\% of the respondents and to a
   greater extent in females than males. Answers following the
   schizophrenia vignette also revealed stigmatizing attitudes in 11.5\% of
   the participants.
   Conclusions: There are relatively low levels of MHL among teenagers in
   Sweden. Awareness campaigns and the implementation of psychoeducation in
   the school curriculum could increase MHL in this group. (C) 2013

Title = {A pilot randomised controlled study of the mental health first aid
   eLearning course with UK medical students},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Month = {MAR 21},
Abstract = {Background: Medical students face many barriers to seeking out
   professional help for their mental health, including stigma relating to
   mental illness, and often prefer to seek support and advice from fellow
   students. Improving medical students' mental health literacy and
   abilities to support someone experiencing a mental health problem could
   reduce barriers to help seeking and improve mental health in this
   population. Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) is an evidence-based
   intervention designed to improve mental health literacy and ability to
   respond to someone with a mental health problem. This pilot randomised
   controlled trial aims to evaluate the MHFA eLearning course in UK
   medical students.
   Methods: Fifty-five medical students were randomised to receive six
   weeks access to the MHFA eLearning course (n = 27) or to a no-access
   control group (n = 28). Both groups completed baseline
   (pre-randomisation) and follow-up (six weeks post-randomisation) online
   questionnaires measuring recognition of a mental health problem, mental
   health first aid intentions, confidence to help a friend experiencing a
   mental health problem, and stigmatising attitudes. Course feedback was
   gathered at follow-up.
   Results: More participants were lost follow-up in the MHFA group
   (51.9\%) compared to control (21.4\%). Both intention-to-treat (ITT) and
   non-ITT analyses showed that the MHFA intervention improved mental
   health first aid intentions (p = <.001) and decreased stigmatising
   attitudes towards people with mental health problems (p = .04). While
   ITT analysis found no significant Group x Time interaction for
   confidence to help a friend, the non-ITT analysis did show the
   intervention improved confidence to help a friend with mental health
   problems (p = <.001), and improved mental health knowledge (p = .003).
   Medical students in the intervention group reported a greater number of
   actual mental health first aid actions at follow-up (p = .006). Feedback
   about the MHFA course was generally positive, with participants stating
   it helped improve their knowledge and confidence to help someone.
   Conclusion: This pilot study demonstrated the potential for the MHFA
   eLearning course to improve UK medical students' mental health first aid
   skills, confidence to help a friend and stigmatising attitudes. It could
   be useful in supporting their own and others' mental health while
   studying and in their future healthcare careers.},

Abstract = {Preventing the development of criminal potential in young people is an
   important component of broader crime reduction strategies. A key feature
   of developmental crime prevention is a comprehensive effort to improve
   the life chances of at-risk children and families, and there is evidence
   that doing so improves long-term life-course outcomes like physical
   health, mental health, education, and employment. We assess available
   research evidence from 12 high-quality studies of developmental crime
   prevention initiatives and find that extensive use of multimodal
   interventions helps to foster cumulative protection over the life
   course, that there are significant improvements in other outcomes over
   the life course, that there are promising signs of intergenerational
   transmission of the intervention effects, and that there is strong
   support for these sorts of interventions from the perspective of
   benefit-cost analysis. We also discuss implications for public policy

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: People with mental illness have been recognized as key
   stakeholders in the development of mental health education. However, few
   studies have evaluated the impact of people with mental illness as
   participants in education programs for students studying to become
   health professionals.
   OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of education provided by mental health
   consumer-educators on the attitudes of pharmacy students toward people
   with mental illness.
   METHODS: The study used a 2 group, nonrandomized, clustered, comparative
   design, with 4 tutorial classes allocated to receive standard
   pharmacist-led instruction (comparison group), and 5 tutorial classes to
   receive standard pharmacist-led instruction plus additional input from
   mental health consumer-educators (intervention group). All pharmacy
   students (N = 229) enrolled in the third year of a 4 year pharmacy
   degree program were invited to participate. Consumer-educators receiving
   ongoing treatment for illnesses including schizophrenia, bipolar
   disorder, and major depression participated in small-group work,
   case-study discussions, and role plays with pharmacy students in the
   intervention group. Pharmacy students' attitudes were assessed using a
   39 item survey instrument derived from previously published instruments
   evaluating social distance, attribution, provision of pharmaceutical
   services, and stigmatization of people with schizophrenia and severe
   depression.
   RESULTS: Paired baseline and follow-up responses were obtained from 117
   students in the intervention group and 94 students in the comparison
   group. Students who received the consumer intervention had decreased
   social distance scores (F((1209)) 5.30; p = 0.02). Students in the
   intervention group more strongly disagreed with 26 of 27 nonsocial
   distance statements that demonstrated a negative attitude toward people
   with mental illness (F((1209)) 13.58; p < 0.001) and more strongly
   agreed with all 4 nonsocial distance statements that demonstrated a
   positive attitude (F((1209)) 7.56; p = 0.014).
   CONCLUSIONS: Consumer participation in mental health education for
   pharmacy students improves students' attitudes toward people with mental
   illness.},

Abstract = {School-based mental health (SBMH) programs and services have grown
   progressively in the United States in the past two decades, related in
   part to increased recognition of their advantages and heightened federal
   support. However, SBMH is an emerging field, with many issues needing
   attention. This introductory article provides a context for the special
   issue by highlighting the importance of increased conceptual clarity
   about SBMH, enhanced mental health-education systems integration, and
   advancement of the SBMH research base. Key elements for success of SBMH
   programs and services are discussed, as underscored recently by the
   report of the New Freedom Commission on Mental Health (2003) and other
   important initiatives. These elements include (a)
   school-family-community agency partnerships, (b) commitment to a full
   continuum of mental health education, mental health promotion,
   assessment, problem prevention, early intervention, and treatment, and
   (c) services for all youth, including those in general and special
   education. A synopsis of the articles in the special issue is provided,
   emphasizing their conceptual and empirical contributions to delivery and
   sustainability of effective mental health practices in schools.},

Abstract = {Among U.S. adolescents, Latinxs have the highest levels of depression
   and the lowest access to treatment. Educational resources on the World
   Wide Web have potential to redress disparities by improving mental
   health literacy, but little is known about the availability and quality
   of web documents about depression targeting Latinx teens. We conducted a
   qualitative content analysis of search-engine results to inform future
   research. Of the 330 results, the majority (48\%) were news stories,
   most with breaking news in Spanish about youth suicides. Only two
   documents targeted Latinx youth, including one that was
   depression-specific. A critique of this document revealed that although
   it met some indicators of web-resource quality, it did not meet its
   potential to empower Latinx teens to raise their depression literacy. We
   argue that such scarcity is an access barrier to preventive care and
   contributes to existing disparities. We highlight the need for web
   documents aiming to enhance depression literacy among Latinx teens that
   are both easily discoverable as well as socio-politically and culturally
   tailored.},

Abstract = {Objective: This paper will describe the formative research underpinning
   ReachOut Parents, an online prevention and early intervention service
   that matches parents with different service elements depending on their
   support needs and preferences. Method: A mixed-methods program of
   research was conducted to understand the unique role of parents and
   carers in supporting adolescents' mental health, specific challenges
   they face, and their needs and preferences for support. This involved a
   literature review, an online survey of 1000 Australian parents, and
   consultation with 32 adolescents. Results: Parents reported needing
   support to understand and respond appropriately to a number of issues
   pertinent to the mental health and wellbeing of their adolescents, some
   of which are unique to this generation of young people. The process of
   recognising that their child has an emerging mental health problem,
   understanding that the problem is serious enough to warrant professional
   intervention, and accessing support services, can be fraught for many
   parents. A number of barriers can prevent parents from accessing formal
   services. Parents and young people both agreed that online support
   services would be valuable to help parents to fulfil their role as a
   change agent in the mental health and wellbeing of their adolescent/s.
   Discussion: Parents are uniquely positioned to respond early to their
   children's mental health difficulties when these arise. Online services
   have considerable potential to reach parents, and support them to
   understand and address emerging mental health problems, in a way that
   best meets the needs of their child.},

Abstract = {Aim Although the reasons behind the stigmatization of psychosis are
   manifold, poor mental health literacy among the general public is likely
   to be a major factor. In Hong Kong, the Early Psychosis Foundation
   (EPISO) was established in 2007 to tackle this issue by providing
   educational and mental health promotional activities, among other aims
   and services. The current study evaluated the effectiveness of a
   school-based interventional programme, the School Tour, developed by
   EPISO. Methods The School Tour differentiates itself from other
   interventional programmes by supplementing a traditional
   psychoeducational talk with 2 additional elements: an engaging drama
   performance and exercise demonstrations. Twelve secondary schools, with
   a total of 4520 students, participated in the study. Knowledge and
   attitudes towards psychosis were evaluated before and after the school
   programme. Results The School Tour was found to improve both students'
   knowledge of psychosis (P < .001) and their attitude (P < .001) towards
   the illness. Conclusions Its effectiveness in reducing the stigma
   towards psychosis validates the use of novel strategies like drama
   performances to engage adolescent students, and urges the government to
   support increased student participation in the programme by providing
   funding to the relevant organizations.},

Title = {Feasibility of a serious game coupled with a contact-based session led
   by lived experience workers for depression prevention in high-school
   students},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 30},
Abstract = {Background Stigma and limited mental health literacy impede adolescents
   getting the help they need for depressive symptoms. A serious game
   coupled with a classroom session led by lived experience workers (LEWs)
   might help to overcome these barriers. The school-based Strong Teens and
   Resilient Minds (STORM) preventive program employed this strategy and
   offered a serious game, Moving Stories. The current study was carried
   out to assess inhibiting and promoting factors for scaling up Moving
   Stories once its effectiveness has been ascertained.
   Methods Moving Stories was offered in three steps: (1) introductory
   classroom session, (2) students playing the game for five days, (3)
   debriefing classroom session led by lived experience worker. Data was
   collected on the number of participating students, costs of offering
   Moving Stories, and was further based on the notes of the debriefing
   sessions to check if mental health first aid (MHFA) strategies were
   addressed.
   Results Moving Stories was offered in seven high-schools. Coverage was
   moderate with 982 participating students out of 1880 (52\%). Most
   participating students (83\%) played the Moving Stories app three out of
   the five days. Qualitative data showed that the MHFAs were discussed in
   all debriefing sessions. Students showed great interest in lived
   experience workers' stories and shared their own experiences with
   depression.
   Conclusions Bringing Moving Stories to scale in the high-school setting
   appears feasible, but will remain logistically somewhat challenging.
   Future implementation and scale-up of Moving Stories could benefit from
   improved selection and training of LEWs that played such an important
   role in grabbing the full attention of students and were able to launch
   frank discussions about depressive disorder and stigma in classrooms.

Title = {An evaluation of the teen and Youth Mental Health First Aid training
   with a CALD focus: an uncontrolled pilot study with adolescents and

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Background Australia is an ethnically diverse nation with one of the
   largest refugee resettlement programs worldwide. Evidence suggests that
   although the risk of developing mental disorders in culturally
   linguistically diverse (CALD) adolescents may be elevated, professional
   help-seeking in CALD youth is low. This study sought to evaluate the
   face-to-face teen (tMHFA) and Youth Mental Health First Aid (YMHFA)
   training with a CALD focus, which aimed at improving mental health
   literacy (MHL) and skills in youth and adults assisting adolescents with
   mental health problems. Methods An uncontrolled pre-, post-, and
   follow-up design was used to measure improvement in MHL measures in year
   10 students and adults. Results A total of 372 year 10 students from 2
   high schools were trained. 308 responded to the pre-training
   questionnaire, 220 responded to the post-training questionnaire, and 256
   completed the 3-month follow-up questionnaire. A total of 34 adults were
   trained, 32 responded to the pre-questionnaire and 31 responded to the
   post-training questionnaire and 20 completed the 3-month follow-up
   questionnaire. Following training, students were more likely to endorse
   `helpful' adults as valid sources of help (p < 0.001) and these gains
   were maintained at follow-up (p < 0.01). Significantly higher levels of
   concordant (helpful) helping intentions were found after training (p <
   0.01), and this was maintained at follow-up (p < 0.05). Significant
   lower levels of discordant (harmful) helping intentions were found after
   training (p < 0.001), and this was maintained at follow-up (p < 0.01). A
   significant improvement in adults' knowledge of youth mental health
   problems and Youth Mental Health First Aid was noted from pre- to
   post-training (p < 0.01) and was maintained at follow-up (p < 0.01).
   Confidence when helping a young person with mental health problems
   increased significantly after training (p < 0.001) and this was
   maintained at follow-up (p < 0.05). Conclusion Our findings indicated
   the training led to an improvement in a number of measures of MHL and
   helpful intentions of both the adolescents and adults evaluated. These
   results indicate that CALD tMHFA and YMHFA are a recommended way of
   upskilling those trained and thereby leading to the improvement youth
   mental health in areas with high proportion of ethnically diverse
   groups.},

Abstract = {Poor knowledge and stigma toward people with mental illness negatively
   affect intentions to seek help among adolescents. The study aimed to
   assess the impact of three school-based interventions and to explore
   whether positive changes in attitudes were linked to more favorable
   changes in desire for social distance and seeking help. A total of 221
   upper secondary students were allocated to three interventions: 1.
   social contact; 2. Mental Health Literacy (MHL) conducted by clinicians;
   3. MHL conducted by dis-peer instructors. Measures of knowledge,
   attitudes, views on empowerment and recovery, willingness to interact,
   and help seeking were collected. Generalized Estimating Equations and
   Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) were used to evaluate scores
   differences between interventions through time, and to test the
   interrelationships between knowledge, attitudes variables and the two
   outcomes of interest. Findings showed that all groups improved in
   knowledge, attitudes, empowerment, willingness to interact, and seeking
   help. SEM revealed that the increase in knowledge was significantly
   associated with the General attitudes toward people with mental illness
   construct that, in turn, was positively associated with willingness to
   interact and seeking help. Results encourage the use of anti-stigma
   interventions in order to decrease negative attitudes toward mental
   illness and improve behavioral intentions among students.},

Abstract = {Objective: This study reports early findings of a still-developing Youth
   Education and Support (YES) pilot intervention of multifamily group
   psychoeducation for youth with a parent with a psychiatric illness.
   Methods: Hypotheses predicted YES participants would increase
   pre-to-post: 1) Knowledge of psychiatric illness and recovery, and 2)
   Coping. A purposive sample Of 17 youth, ages 10-16, participated in six
   lively, activity-focused, two-hour sessions within four groups
   facilitated by the PI and professionals employed within two public
   mental health agencies. Data revealed a significant increase in
   pre-to-post youth-reported knowledge (p=less than 001) and no
   significant change in overall coping. At post-intervention, youth
   reported significantly increased use of the coping skills of avoiding
   problems and relaxing, as indicated within these coping subscales.
   Conclusions: Study limitations merit interpretation caution. They are
   useful for future research, including development and testing of youth
   psychoeducation programs with longer interventions, more emphases on
   coping, parent-inclusion, and larger samples using randomized,
   experimental designs. Suggestions for research, practice, and policy are
   provided.},

Title = {Improving adolescents' knowledge about mental health and depression: a
   randomized experimental study of web-based information},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN DIGITAL HEALTH},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {7},
Month = {NOV 18},
Abstract = {Adolescents often lack adequate knowledge about mental health and
   available professional support, which hinders timely help-seeking. As
   many adolescents seek information online, providing reliable web-based
   resources may enhance their mental health literacy. This randomized
   experimental study (preregistered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05300217)
   examined the effectiveness and reception of innovative online
   information designed to improve adolescents' knowledge of depression and
   mental health. A total of 77 adolescents aged 12-18 years were randomly
   assigned to one of two conditions: (1) web-based information on
   depression or (2) web-based information on strategies to promote mental
   health. Both interventions were derived from the evidence-based website
   ``ich bin alles{''} (English translation: ``I am everything{''}).
   Primary outcomes were knowledge of depression and knowledge of
   strategies to promote mental health, assessed immediately after the
   intervention and at 2- and 4-week follow-ups. Secondary outcomes
   included perceived visual aesthetics, ease of use, utility, and
   enjoyment. Adolescents showed significant increases in knowledge of
   depression {[}F (3, 76.67) = 13.29, p < .001] and knowledge of
   strategies to promote mental health {[}F (3, 76.41) = 7.89, p <.001]
   over time, attributable to the assigned information. Participants also
   rated the website's visual aesthetics, ease of use, utility, and
   enjoyment positively. Age-appropriate, visually appealing web-based
   information effectively improved adolescents' knowledge of depression
   and mental health. Freely accessible, evidence-based online resources
   represent a scalable strategy to strengthen mental health literacy among
   young people.},

Abstract = {Young people are at a high risk of developing mental health disorders or
   illnesses. Mental health promotion (MHP) interventions can reduce this
   risk. Using the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for the
   development and evaluation of complex interventions, this study designed
   and acceptability tested a methodologically robust school-based mental
   health promotion intervention. A scoping review and focus groups with
   stakeholders were conducted during the development phase of the MRC
   framework. The scoping review involved identifying evidence for
   effective school-based MHP interventions. Focus groups were then used to
   determine the acceptability of components identified by the scoping
   review and to clarify the target or goal of taking part in the
   intervention. A logic model, showing the theory of change underpinning
   an intervention designed on the basis of this development phase, was
   subsequently developed. The scoping review established that MHP
   interventions typically focus on stigma and stereotypes, mental health
   literacy and knowledge and help-seeking, and use these foci to determine
   impact. Common intervention components include group discussion, videos,
   presentations, storytelling and handouts. Testing of these commonly
   occurring components targeting knowledge and attitudes towards mental
   health and stigma and stereotypes suggested all were acceptable to
   stakeholders. Using the MRC framework to guide the development and test
   the acceptability of a MHP intervention, this study has produced a
   complex evidence-based health promotion intervention using interactive
   activities and videos. Further phases will involve a process evaluation
   of the intervention fidelity and feasibility testing.},

Abstract = {Public health professionals seek to promote health literacy through
   education. In the mental health arena, such approaches have included
   teaching primary care gatekeepers to screen for early identification of
   suicide risk and teaching members of the general public to engage peers
   in need of mental health treatment and guide them into evidence-based
   care. Educational positivism is the belief that this pedagogic
   enterprise is unlimited, leading to a ``more is better{''} approach.
   Despite its promise, however, educational approaches may have muted
   effects. Students in discrete training programs are often overwhelmed by
   too much information. Moreover, the effects of distributed training
   programs, which usually involve repeated training over longer periods,
   compete with already existing schemes of health action as well as the
   cacophony of other channels of information. Strategies to address these
   concerns are described.},

Title = {Mental health literacy among pediatric hospital staff in the United Arab
   Emirates},
Journal = {BMC PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Month = {DEC 8},
Abstract = {Background: In the United Arab Emirates (UAE) 35\% of the population are
   aged 0-24 years. A significant proportion of these young people are
   living with chronic conditions (e.g., asthma, type 1 diabetes, cardiac
   conditions, and geneticallytransmitted conditions such as thalassemia
   and cystic fibrosis). This group has increased vulnerability to
   developmental delays and mental health problems, and is increasingly
   coming to the attention of service providers in mainstream schools,
   primary healthcare centers, and pediatric hospitals. Despite the
   government directing attention to improving the mental health of the UAE
   population, there is concern that mental health services are not growing
   at the rate needed to meet the mental health needs of children and young
   people with chronic conditions.
   Method: A cross sectional survey design was used to determine the mental
   health literacy of nurses and other healthcare professionals working
   with children with chronic illnesses. Participants completed a
   culturally-adapted mental health literacy questionnaire comprising three
   vignettes of fictional characters meeting diagnostic criteria for
   posttraumatic stress disorder, psychosis, and depression with suicidal
   thoughts. Participants also completed the Kessler Psychological Distress
   Scale (K10).
   Results: Participants were 317 healthcare professionals from across the
   UAE. The majority were nurses. Correct identification of the diagnosis
   for each vignette was limited, with the highest level of accuracy
   achieved for the psychosis vignette (n = 113, 54.3\%). Accurate
   identification of appropriate evidence-based interventions was also
   limited. K10 scores indicated 40\% of participants had moderate to high
   levels of psychological distress.
   Conclusions: These findings are concerning and provide important data to
   inform the development of undergraduate and continuing education
   programs for nurses. The K10 scores suggest healthcare professionals are
   under considerable stress, highlighting the need to support healthcare
   professionals who experience multiple psychosocial stressors.},

   athletes: a qualitative study},
Journal = {BMC PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {12},
Month = {SEP 26},
Abstract = {Background: Adolescents and young adults experience a high level of
   mental disorders, yet tend not to seek help. Research indicates that
   there are many barriers and facilitators to help-seeking for young
   people in the general community. However there are limited data
   available for young elite athletes. This study aims to determine what
   young elite athletes perceive as the barriers and facilitators to
   help-seeking for common mental health problems.
   Methods: Fifteen elite athletes aged 16-23 years each participated in
   one of three focus group discussions. In addition to written data,
   verbal responses were audio taped, transcribed and thematically
   analysed.
   Results: Participants' written and verbal data suggested that stigma was
   the most important perceived barrier to seeking help for young elite
   athletes. Other notable barriers were a lack of mental health literacy,
   and negative past experiences of help-seeking. Facilitators to
   help-seeking were encouragement from others, having an established
   relationship with a provider, pleasant previous interactions with
   providers, the positive attitudes of others, especially their coach, and
   access to the internet.
   Conclusions: Intervention strategies for improving help-seeking in young
   elite athletes should focus on reducing stigma, increasing mental health
   literacy, and improving relations with potential providers.},

Abstract = {Mental health issues are a prominent burden among adolescents and young
   adults in Southeast Asia, compounded by reluctance to seek help and low
   treatment rates. This mixed-method systematic review analyzed
   help-seeking profiles (preference, facilitators, and barriers) and
   evaluated implemented help-seeking programs. Data were sourced from
   electronic databases, hand-searched local databases, conference
   proceedings, and grey literature. Study selection followed PRISMA 2020
   guidelines, focusing on 1) adolescents (10-19 years) and young adults
   (18-26 years) in Southeast Asia who were not receiving mental health
   care, 2) assessing help-seeking behavior, and 3) evaluating programs to
   increase help-seeking. A total of 16 articles were identified.
   Help-seeking behavior Southeast Asian youth was shaped by mental health
   literacy and stigma (including attitudes from family, peers, and the
   wider community). Program effectiveness was mixed, with improvement
   often lacking significant differences from control groups or failing to
   persist at follow-up. These findings emphasized the need for more
   community-level and upstream policy interventions alongside
   individual-level interventions to improve mental health literacy and
   stigma. Developing interventions requires methodological improvements in
   help-seeking research, and ultimately, accessible and trustworthy mental
   health services are crucial to sustaining progress.},

Title = {Toward the Early Recognition of Psychosis Among Spanish-Speaking Adults

Journal = {PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES},

Volume = {11},

Abstract = {Lack of knowledge about psychosis, a condition oftentimes associated
   with serious mental illness, may contribute to disparities in mental
   health service use. Psychoeducational interventions aimed at improving
   psychosis literacy have attracted significant attention recently, but
   few have focused on the growing numbers of ethnic and linguistic
   minorities in countries with large immigrant populations, such as the
   United States. This paper reports on 2 studies designed to evaluate the
   effectiveness of a DVD version of La CLAve, a psychoeducational program
   that aims to increase psychosis literacy among Spanish-speaking Latinos.
   Study 1 is a randomized control study to test directly the efficacy of a
   DVD version of La CLAve for Spanish speakers across a range of
   educational backgrounds. Fifty-seven medical students and 68 community
   residents from Mexico were randomly assigned to view either La CLAve or
   a psychoeducational program of similar length regarding caregiving.
   Study 2 employed a single-subjects design to evaluate the effectiveness
   of the DVD presentation when administered by a community mental health
   educator. Ninety-three Spanish-speakers from San Diego, California
   completed assessments both before and after receiving the DVD training.
   Results from these 2 studies indicate that the DVD version of La CLAve
   is capable of producing a range of psychosis literacy gains for
   Spanish-speakers in both the United States and Mexico, even when
   administered by a community worker. Thus, it has potential for
   widespread dissemination and use among underserved communities of
   Spanish-speaking Latinos and for minimizing disparities in mental health
   service use, particularly as it relates to insufficient knowledge of
   psychosis.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Clinical learning experiences are known to exacerbate nursing student
   anxiety, causing them to present to clinical placement in distressed,
   meaning anxious, states. Students already living with anxiety are also
   more likely to suffer setbacks at this time. Supervising Registered
   Nurses (RNs), in the clinical settings, struggle to support this student
   cohort. A professional development activity was designed to introduce
   RNs to higher education and nursing students' known mental health
   concerns (such as anxiety) and to arm them with strategies for working
   with distressed students. A research approach that enabled researchers
   to collaborate with participants was employed to design the
   intervention. A study evaluated the impact of the educational
   intervention with 45 Australian RN supervisors. Two tailed T-tests were
   chosen to explore the statistical difference between pre- and post-test
   mean results across the survey items. A 95\% confidence interval was
   used. Statistical significance was set at <0.05. The evaluation
   indicated the activity could be useful for improving supervising RNs'
   mental health literacy, thus enhancing their understanding of how to
   work with distressed students. Participants recommended the activity be
   offered to any staff supporting student clinical learning. Collaboration
   between nursing researchers and nursing clinical staff produced a
   meaningful professional development activity and motivated the
   participants to increase their mental health literacy and understanding
   of strategies to support distressed students. Future projects should
   adopt similar approaches that would support both RNs' ability to support
   students' during clinical learning and students in distress would also
   benefit.},

Title = {Potential harm from universal school-based mental health interventions:
   Candidate mechanisms and future directions},
Journal = {CURRENT OPINION IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2026},
Volume = {67},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Universal school-based mental health interventions involve lessons
   delivered to whole classes of young people irrespective of need, with
   the overall aim of improving mental health literacy, preventing mental
   health problems and/or reducing those that have already started. A
   number of high-quality trials show that universal interventions can have
   a range of negative effects, with participants in the intervention group
   experiencing worsening mental health or other negative outcomes. In this
   review, we summarise what we know so far about these negative effects,
   which we refer to as `potential harm'. Two important questions remain
   poorly understood. First, the mechanisms driving potential harm are
   unknown, including whether negative effects are driven by reporting
   phenomena, the content of the intervention itself, or both. Second,
   individual differences in susceptibility to these effects is unclear. In
   the second half of the paper, we explore whether further universal
   trials should be run and argue that, if they are, the crucial issue of
   negative effects must be considered at all stages. In particular, we
   recommend that trials be designed in such a way to test mechanisms and
   individual differences in response. Information can then be provided to
   schools and policymakers about why young people might respond in
   different ways to an intervention, and how to support vulnerable
   students. Ultimately, this will lead to more effective and less harmful
   interventions for everyone.},

   perspectives of adolescent males' parents},
Journal = {QUALITATIVE RESEARCH IN SPORT EXERCISE AND HEALTH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Pages = {372-388},
Abstract = {Adolescent males are at relatively high risk of developing mental health
   disorders and show low rates of help seeking when mental health
   disorders arise. Parents are the primary source of support for
   adolescents and therefore have an important role in mental health
   promotion and prevention of mental health disorders. The aim of this
   study was to examine the perceptions of adolescent males' parents on the
   potential role of community sport clubs in adolescent mental health
   promotion. Forty-six parents of adolescent males took part in 10 focus
   groups to investigate parents' mental health knowledge, beliefs and
   attitudes, perceptions of the role of sport clubs in mental health
   promotion and disorder prevention, and factors that might promote or
   limit participation in (and effectiveness of) mental health-focused
   interventions. Thematic analysis revealed that parents had low levels of
   mental health literacy, were worried about the development of mental
   health disorders, but reported favourable attitudes towards receiving
   education on adolescent mental health. Parents also reported low
   confidence in their ability to discuss mental health with their
   adolescent and expressed mixed views on the role of the sport club in
   promoting positive mental health. These findings are considered in the
   context of developing mental health interventions that can maximise use
   of the unique youth sport environment.},

Volume = {28},

Abstract = {Mental health difficulties in the preschool years require early
   intervention, but preschool children are underserved in mental
   healthcare. One explanation might be that parents do not seek services
   because their problem recognition, or labeling, ability is lacking.
   While previous research demonstrates that labeling is positively
   associated with help-seeking, interventions aimed at improving
   help-seeking by improving labeling are not always successful. Parental
   perceptions of severity, impairment, and stress also predict
   help-seeking, but have not been examined alongside labeling. Thus, it is
   unclear how much they add to the parental help-seeking process. The
   present study simultaneously examined labeling and parental perceptions
   of severity, impairment, and stress on help-seeking. Participants (82
   adult mothers of children ages 3-5 years) read vignettes describing
   preschool-aged children with symptoms of depression, anxiety, and ADHD,
   and answered a series of questions to assess their labeling and
   likelihood of help-seeking for each of the problems presented.
   Help-seeking was found to be positively associated with labeling (r =
   .73; r = .60), severity (r = .66), impairment (r = .31), and stress (r =
   .25). Furthermore, severity, impairment, and stress predicted
   endorsements of help-seeking above and beyond what was predicted by
   labeling alone (R- 2  change = .12; chi(2) (3) = 20.03, p < .01). These
   results underscore the importance of parental perceptions of children's
   behavior to the help-seeking process.},

Title = {Mental health training programs for community pharmacists, pharmacy
   staff and students: A systematic review},
Journal = {RESEARCH IN SOCIAL \& ADMINISTRATIVE PHARMACY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {11},
Pages = {3895-3910},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Background: Primary care is often the first point of contact for people
   living with mental disorders. Community pharmacists, pharmacy staff and
   students are increasingly being trained to deliver mental health care.
   However, there is still a gap in the literature exploring the
   characteristics of all available mental health training programs and
   their components and their influence on pharmacists, pharmacy staff and
   students' outcomes.
   Objectives: To summarize the evidence evaluating mental health training
   programs completed by community pharmacists, pharmacy staff and
   students. More specifically, to explore the components of mental health
   training programs and identify those that facilitate significant
   improvements in outcomes.
   Methods: A systematic review was conducted following the Cochrane
   handbook and reported according to PRISMA guidelines. A search for
   published literature was conducted in three databases (PubMed, Scopus,
   and Web of Science) in July 2021. Eligible studies were included if they
   described and evaluated the impact of mental health training programs
   delivered to community pharmacists, pharmacy staff and pharmacy students
   regardless of design or comparator. The methodological quality of
   included studies was appraised using both the NIH quality assessment, to
   evaluate studies with an uncontrolled pre-post design, and the Cochrane
   EPOC risk of bias assessment, to evaluate studies with a controlled
   (randomized and non-randomized) study design.
   Results: Thirty-three studies were included. Most of the identified
   mental health training programs contained knowledge-based components and
   active learning activities. Changes in participants' attitudes, stigma,
   knowledge, confidence and skills were frequently assessed. An extensive
   range of self-assessment and observational instruments used to evaluate
   the impact of the training programs were identified. Positive
   improvements in participants' attitudes, knowledge and stigma were
   frequently identified following participation in training programs.
   Conclusions: This systematic review highlights the importance of mental
   health training programs in increasing pharmacists', pharmacy staff and
   pharmacy students' skills and confidence to deliver mental health care
   in community pharmacy. Future research should build upon this basis and
   further focus on finding the most efficient measures to evaluate these
   training programs and assess their long-term effectiveness, allowing
   comparison between programs.},

Abstract = {Syrian refugees in T \& uuml;rkiye show a high prevalence of mental
   health problems but encounter barriers to accessing mental health
   services. Group Problem Management Plus (gPM+), developed by the World
   Health Organization, is a low-intensity psychological intervention
   delivered by nonspecialist facilitators. This qualitative process
   evaluation explores the acceptability, feasibility and perceived
   effectiveness of gPM+ for Syrian refugees resettled in T \& uuml;rkiye,
   as well as facilitating factors and barriers to its implementation.
   Twenty-three semi-structured interviews were conducted with gPM+
   participants, facilitators, drop-outs, relatives of participants and key
   informants. Findings showed that gPM+ was well-received for its
   group-based format, which participants felt fostered social support, and
   for its content, which they reported may have led to improvements in
   coping skills and family relationships. Facilitators viewed the
   intervention as feasible to implement. However, barriers such as
   participants' economic struggles, practical challenges (e.g., childcare
   and transportation difficulties) and low mental health literacy impeded
   engagement. Adapting gPM+ to address social determinants like poverty
   may be beneficial. The need for booster sessions was emphasized to
   maintain long-term change and provide deeper learning of the strategies.
   For sustainable scaling up gPM+ within primary health care, key
   informants highlighted the importance of training and supervising
   nonprofessional facilitators and securing governmental support.},

Title = {Strategies to Safeguard Mental Health Among Medical and Allied Health
   Trainees: A Narrative Review},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN MEDICAL EDUCATION AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {16},
Pages = {2219-2227},
Abstract = {Medical and allied health training programs are inherently demanding,
   often compromising trainees' mental health through prolonged workloads,
   emotional exhaustion, and systemic pressures. This narrative review
   explores evidence-based strategies and institutional frameworks aimed at
   safeguarding mental health among medical and allied health trainees. The
   review seeks to identify effective interventions that balance
   professional rigor with psychological well-being. A targeted literature
   search of PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar (2000-2025) was
   conducted using keywords such as mental health, burnout, medical
   education, wellness, and resilience. Eligible publications addressing
   psychological stress, mental health interventions, and systemic reforms
   in trainee education were analyzed thematically to synthesize protective
   strategies and best practices. Findings reveal that mental health
   challenges-including anxiety, depression, and burnout-affect over
   one-third of health trainees globally. Protective measures identified
   include structured mentorship, mindfulness-based resilience programs,
   time management training, and confidential psychological support
   services. Institutional strategies such as curriculum flexibility,
   rest-hour regulations, and leadership-driven wellness policies were
   shown to reduce stress and improve academic satisfaction. The inclusion
   of peer support systems and integration of wellness education further
   enhance psychological safety and engagement. Safeguarding trainee mental
   health requires a balanced approach combining personal
   resilience-building with organizational reform. Embedding wellness
   curricula, promoting mental health literacy, and ensuring access to
   support systems can mitigate burnout and improve patient care outcomes.
   Future efforts should focus on implementing evidence-based mental health
   frameworks and fostering a culture of openness within training
   institutions.},

Title = {Mental Health Literacy in Adults: Turkish Mothers' Knowledge of
   Posttraumatic Stress Disorder},
Journal = {KINDHEIT UND ENTWICKLUNG},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 OCT 1},
Abstract = {: Theoretical Background: Mental health literacy (MHL) is crucial for
   early detection and intervention of mental health disorders. Among
   parents, particularly mothers, MHL plays a vital role in recognizing
   symptoms in children. Cultural norms might influence mothers' ability to
   recognize and address mental health issues such as posttraumatic stress
   disorder (PTSD). Although trauma (e. g., disasters, migration, domestic
   stressors) is a significant concern among children in Turkey, there is
   limited research on mothers' PTSD literacy, particularly how cultural
   values shape their MHL. Objective: This study aimed to explore the
   levels of MHL among Turkish mothers, specifically focusing on their
   ability to recognize PTSD symptoms. It also investigated the role of
   cultural factors on mothers' MHL. Method: A cross-sectional study was
   conducted with 510 Turkish mothers (M\_age = 42.5, SD = 6.65, with
   children aged 0 - 24 years). Participants were recruited via online
   parenting networks and completed a form including demographic
   information, a PTSD vignette, and the cultural values scale (honor,
   dignity, face) through an online survey. The data were analyzed using
   descriptive statistical techniques and logistic regression to identify
   factors associated with correct PTSD diagnosis. Results: The results
   showed that nearly 20 \% of the mothers were able to correctly identify
   PTSD symptoms. Mothers who had lower adherence to face culture values
   (less concern about social approval), lived outside Turkey, worked in
   healthcare, were well-educated, and had younger children were more
   likely to correctly identify PTSD symptoms. Discussion and Conclusion:
   Findings highlight low MHL regarding PTSD among Turkish mothers and
   emphasize the influence of the cultural context. Specifically, strong
   emphasis on social-preserving group reputation in face cultures may
   hinder recognition of mental health problems. Culturally sensitive
   interventions are needed to improve mothers' MHL.
   Zusammenfassung: Theoretischer Hintergrund: Mental Health Literacy (MHL)
   ist entscheidend f \& uuml;r die Fr \& uuml;herkennung und Intervention
   bei psychischen St \& ouml;rungen. Bei Eltern, insbesondere bei M \&
   uuml;ttern, spielt MHL eine wichtige Rolle bei der Erkennung von
   Symptomen bei Kindern. Kulturelle Normen k \& ouml;nnen die F \&
   auml;higkeit von M \& uuml;ttern beeinflussen, psychische Probleme wie
   posttraumatische Belastungsst \& ouml;rungen (PTBS) zu erkennen. Obwohl
   Traumata (z. B. Katastrophen, Migration, h \& auml;usliche
   Stressfaktoren) bei Kindern in der T \& uuml;rkei ein bedeutendes
   Problem darstellen, gibt es nur wenige Untersuchungen \& uuml;ber
   PTBS-Wissen von M \& uuml;ttern, insbesondere dazu, wie kulturelle Werte
   ihre MHL beeinflussen. Ziel: Diese Studie zielt darauf ab, Mental Health
   Literacy bei t \& uuml;rkischen M \& uuml;ttern zu untersuchen, mit
   besonderem Schwerpunkt auf ihrer F \& auml;higkeit, PTBS-Symptome zu
   erkennen. Au ss erdem wird die Rolle kultureller Faktoren f \& uuml;r
   die MHL von M \& uuml;ttern untersucht. Methode: Es wurde eine
   Querschnittsstudie mit 510 t \& uuml;rkischen M \& uuml;ttern mit
   Kindern im Alter von 0 bis 24 Jahren durchgef \& uuml;hrt. Die
   Teilnehmerinnen wurden \& uuml;ber Online-Elternnetzwerke rekrutiert und
   f \& uuml;llten im Rahmen einer Online-Umfrage ein Formular mit
   demografischen Angaben, einer PTBS-Vignette und der Skala f \& uuml;r
   kulturelle Werte (Ehre, W \& uuml;rde, Ansehen) aus. Die Daten wurden
   mit deskriptiven statistischen Verfahren und logistischer Regression
   analysiert, um Faktoren zu identifizieren, die mit einer korrekten
   PTBS-Diagnose in Zusammenhang stehen. Ergebnisse: Die Ergebnisse
   zeigten, dass fast 20 \% der M \& uuml;tter in der Lage waren,
   PTBS-Symptome korrekt zu identifizieren. M \& uuml;tter, die sich
   weniger an Werte einer ,,Gesichtswahrung{''} hielten (weniger Sorge um
   soziale Anerkennung), au ss erhalb der T \& uuml;rkei lebten, im
   Gesundheitswesen arbeiteten, gut ausgebildet waren und j \& uuml;ngere
   Kinder hatten, konnten PTBS-Symptome eher korrekt erkennen. Diskussion
   und Schlussfolgerung: Die Ergebnisse unterstreichen das geringe
   Gesundheitsbewusstsein in Bezug auf PTBS unter t \& uuml;rkischen M \&
   uuml;ttern und betonen den Einfluss des kulturellen Kontexts.
   Insbesondere die starke Betonung der Erhaltung des Ansehens in der
   Gruppe kann die Erkennung von psychischen Problemen behindern. Es sind
   kulturell sensible Ma ss nahmen erforderlich, um das
   Gesundheitsbewusstsein der M \& uuml;tter zu verbessern.},

Journal = {BMC NURSING},

Volume = {24},

Month = {JUL 30},
Abstract = {BackgroundIntegrating mental health education into undergraduate nursing
   curricula is essential for equipping primary health care nurses to
   effectively address mental health challenges. Despite the growing burden
   of mental health disorders in South Africa, nursing graduates often lack
   sufficient mental health training, limiting their ability to provide
   holistic care. This study investigated the perspectives of nurse
   educators and preceptors and nursing students on the integration of
   mental health in nursing education.MethodsAn exploratory case study
   design was employed. Data were collected through individual interviews
   guided by a structured interview schedule. Participants - comprising
   purposefully selected nurse educators, nurse preceptors, and
   undergraduate nursing students - were drawn from a South African nursing
   education institution. Data collection occurred between October and
   November 2023. Thematic analysis was conducted to distil key
   perspectives from the interviews.ResultsThree central themes emerged:
   The first theme was ``curriculum and teaching challenges{''}- Educators
   faced difficulties in bridging theory and practice due to limited
   hands-on training opportunities. While innovative teaching methods had
   previously enhanced learning, ethical and emotional concerns arose when
   students shared subjective experiences. The second theme was ``students'
   attitudes and preparedness{''}- Initially, students exhibited
   indifference toward mental health care, but clinical exposure gradually
   shifted their perceptions. However, emotional unpreparedness and fear of
   psychiatric settings hindered their learning experiences. The third
   theme was ``suggestions for strengthening mental health care
   integration{''}- Participants advocated for enriched theoretical
   content, increased clinical hours, early and continuous exposure to
   mental health care, structured emotional debriefing sessions, and short
   courses aimed at enhancing practical competence and student
   support.ConclusionThis study highlights the disparity between ideal
   mental health education and the reality within South African
   undergraduate nursing curricula. Educators, preceptors, and students
   emphasised the need for comprehensive training reforms, including early
   exposure, extended practical hours, structured emotional support, and
   mentorship. Such measures could foster a more realistic approach to
   mental health nursing and better prepare graduates to deliver integrated
   mental health care within primary health care settings.Clinical trial

Abstract = {IntroductionResilience is considered of high relevance when developing
   interventions to cope with stressful situations. Schools are one of the
   key settings to promote resilience among adolescents. The purpose of
   this cluster randomized controlled trial is to assess the effectiveness
   of an intervention in adolescents at risk, aged 12-to-15 years old, to
   increase resilience and emotional regulation strategies.MethodsThe
   recruitment period started in January 2022. Schools will be randomly
   allocated to control and intervention groups by an external researcher
   using computer-generated random numbers. The minimum sample size was
   estimated to be 70 participants per group. Primary health care nurses
   will carry out the intervention during the school period (January to
   June 2022). Students will follow a specific training consisting of six
   55-min sessions, for 6 weeks. Each session will consist of 5 min of
   mindfulness, followed by 45 min of the corresponding activity:
   introducing resilience, self-esteem, emotional regulation strategies,
   social skills, problem-solving, community resources, social and peer
   support, and 5 min to explain the activity to do at home. Data will be
   collected at baseline, 6 weeks, and 24 weeks after the intervention. The
   child youth resilience measure-32 (CYRM-32) scale will be used to assess
   the effectiveness of the intervention. This study received a grant in
   June 2021.DiscussionThe intervention is intended to improve mental
   health through resilience. Different factors related to resilience will
   be promoted, such as self-esteem, emotional regulation, social and
   communication skills, problem-solving and peer support, among others. As
   it has been designed as a cluster-randomized school-based intervention,
   we will directly ameliorate the participation and engagement of the
   target population. With the present intervention, we expect to improve
   coping skills in adolescents by enhancing resilience capacities.},

Month = {MAR-APR},
Abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic accelerated the impending youth
   mental health crisis in the United States, necessitating a comprehensive
   approach to providing mental health education and interventions.
   School-based occupational therapy practitioners' scope of practice
   includes wellness promotion, early detection, and evidence -based
   interventions for mental health challenges. Given the rise of
   school-based wellness programs, the growing legislation supporting the
   formation of such programs, and the burgeoning burden of pediatric
   mental health concerns, occupational therapy practitioners are uniquely
   positioned to create and implement interventions to support student
   access to the general education curriculum and can do so by using both
   prepandemic funding sources and pandemic response funds. This Health
   Policy Perspectives column is a call to action to refocus the
   occupational therapy practitioner's role in school settings to include
   providing high-quality, evidence-based preventive mental health
   education and interventions. In this column, we examine prevention-based
   occupational therapy services in Mason City Schools, Mason, Ohio, as a
   model of success in the execution of this vision for school-based
   practice. In addition, we outline the importance of expanding the role
   of occupational therapy practitioners in schools, which will in turn
   increase the visibility and relevancy of the profession and broaden its
   impact on mitigating the youth mental health crisis.},

Abstract = {Recent surveys show rising numbers of young people who report anxiety
   and depression. Although much attention has focused on mental health of
   adolescent youth, less attention has been paid to young people as they
   transition into adulthood. Multiple factors may have contributed to this
   steady increase: greater exposure to social media, information, and
   distressing news via personal electronic devices; increased concerns
   regarding social determinants of health and climate change; and changing
   social norms due to increased mental health literacy and reduced stigma.
   The COVID-19 pandemic may have temporarily exacerbated symptoms and
   impacted treatment availability. Strategies to mitigate causal factors
   for depression and anxiety in young adults may include education and
   skills training for cognitive, behavioral, and social coping strategies,
   as well as healthier use of technology and social media. Policies must
   support the availability of health insurance and treatment, and
   clinicians can adapt interventions to encompass the specific concerns
   and needs of young adults.},

Title = {Digital Mental Health Interventions for Young People in Rural South
   Africa: Prospects and Challenges for Implementation},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {20},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Globally, most young people living with mental health conditions lack
   access to mental health care but have access to a mobile device. The
   growing access to mobile devices in South Africa has the potential to
   increase access to mental health care services through digital
   platforms. However, uptake of digital mental health interventions may be
   hampered by several factors, such as privacy, confidentiality, informed
   consent, and affordability. This study identified the prospects and
   challenges of implementing a mobile phone-based mental health
   intervention for young people in Ingwavuma area. Data were collected
   from 93 young people in three villages purposefully selected in
   Ingwavuma area. Participants included in the study were aged 16-24. Data
   were collected through a questionnaire. Thematic and descriptive
   analysis was performed on the qualitative and quantitative data,
   respectively. Mental health education was low, with only 22\% of
   participants having received prior education on mental health. About
   50\% of the participants had come across a mental health app, but none
   of them had used any of these apps; 87\% of participants had Internet
   access; 60\% preferred to use social media to contact a health worker;
   and 92\% suggested that use of digital apps would improve mental health
   literacy among young people. Barriers to access of digital mental health
   interventions were identified as the high cost of data, restrictive
   religious beliefs, limited privacy, lack of native languages on most
   digital platforms, low digital literacy, and complicated user interface.
   In uMkhanyakude, uptake of digital mental health apps among the young
   people was low. We recommend that, developers create context-specific
   digital applications catered for young people from different cultural
   backgrounds. Socio-economic issues such as affordability also need to be
   addressed in developing these tools.},

Title = {Awareness of headspace youth mental health service centres across

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4},
Pages = {410-417},
Month = {JUL 3},
Abstract = {Background: Two common barriers to help-seeking are lack of awareness of
   appropriate services, and low mental health literacy. The headspace
   awareness campaigns are designed to address these factors. Aims: To
   examine whether distance from a headspace centre affects community
   awareness of headspace, and whether general awareness of headspace
   changed between 2008 and 2015. Method: Responses from 4707 participants
   aged 12-25 years, collected in 2008 and 2015, were analysed. The effect
   of headspace centre location on awareness of services was assessed by
   comparing awareness between those living in headspace areas (within 20
   km of a centre) and those who were not. Change in awareness between 2008
   and 2015 was assessed. Results: Awareness of headspace and its services
   was significantly greater among those living in headspace areas than
   among those living further away. Within headspace areas, awareness
   increased by 27\% between 2008 and 2015. Prompted and unprompted
   awareness were significantly greater in 2015 than in 2008. Conclusions:
   Awareness of headspace has increased over time; however, innovative
   awareness campaigns are needed for those residing in non-headspace
   areas. Continued funding to increase headspace's national coverage,
   improving mental health literacy and service access for youth and their
   families, particularly those living in non-headspace areas, is needed.},

Title = {Preliminary impact of the say no to stigma intervention on attitudes
   toward mental illness: A pilot randomized clinical trial among primary
   school students in Uganda},
Journal = {CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW},
Year = {2026},
Volume = {180},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Background Mental health stigma is a critical barrier to help-seeking
   behaviors among youth struggling with mental health challenges. However,
   studies examining the impact of mental health literacy and anti-stigma
   interventions in sub-Saharan Africa are limited. In this study, we
   examined the preliminary impact of the Say No to Stigma intervention, a
   set of visuals co-created with school-going children in Uganda, on
   reducing mental health stigma in school settings. Methods We analyzed
   longitudinal data from a 1-year two-arm pilot randomized clinical trial
   that recruited 100 children (ages 8-13) from two public primary schools
   in Uganda. Each school was randomly assigned to either the intervention
   or the control group. We utilized mixed-effects linear regression
   analysis to examine the effect of the intervention on social distance
   and attitudes toward mental illness at 3 months post-intervention
   initiation. Results The mean age was 11.4 years, and 58 \% of the
   participants were females. At 3 months post-intervention initiation,
   results from the mixed effects model showed that the main effect for the
   group was statistically significant (chi(2)(1) = 5.56, p < 0.018) for
   social distance. On the other hand, the group main effects were not
   statistically significant for attitudes toward mental illness. However,
   the intervention-time interaction effect for attitudes toward mental
   illness was statistically significant (chi(2)(1) = 5.02, p = 0.025).
   Conclusions The study results provide a compelling rationale for testing
   the Say No to Stigma intervention in a larger randomized clinical trial.},

Abstract = {Aim Treatment for youth who are at clinical high risk for psychosis
   (CHR-P) presents an opportunity for early intervention with the capacity
   to decrease the burden associated with a potential psychotic disorder
   later in life. However, significant barriers prevent youth at CHR-P from
   accessing speciality mental health services. Few studies have examined
   the pathways to care for youth at CHR-P within the U.S. health system.
   Methods The present study reports the results of a codebook thematic
   analysis of qualitative interviews conducted with caregivers (primarily
   parents) of 15 youth (ages 12-25 years) who entered a CHR-P speciality
   program. Using a semi-structured interview, we inquired about their
   experiences navigating the health system to eventually arrive at the
   speciality program, including help-seeking events and referrals,
   caregivers' attributions for youths' CHR-P symptoms, and barriers and
   facilitators to care. Results Caregivers reported confusion and
   uncertainty regarding the causes of symptoms. They also disclosed the
   significant challenges to obtaining mental health care, including low
   mental health literacy, illness stigma, provider unavailability or
   appropriateness and adequacy of referrals. Most of the youth had
   encounters with emergency services during their help-seeking journey.
   Conclusion Our results help define targets for future policy, research
   and clinical efforts to improve access to speciality care for youth at
   CHR-P in the U.S.},

Abstract = {This narrative review addresses the integration of health education into
   school curricula in South Tyrol, an Italian province with significant
   cultural and linguistic diversity. This review's objective is to analyze
   current health education initiatives and propose a strategic framework
   to enhance school-based health education, aiming to improve student
   well-being post-pandemic. The review synthesizes global examples and
   recent local studies, highlighting the importance of comprehensive
   teacher training, mindfulness-based interventions, culturally sensitive
   health education, and community engagement. The key findings indicate
   that current health education programs in South Tyrol are insufficient
   to meet immediate public health needs, such as low vaccine uptake and
   mental health challenges exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The
   proposed strategic framework seeks to align educational strategies with
   the diverse needs of South Tyrol's student population, thereby improving
   health literacy and behavior and strengthening the region's public
   health infrastructure.},

Abstract = {To date, relatively little attention has been paid to optimizing the
   development of education programmes to support safe and effective health
   care professionals. In particular, the wider stakeholders, particularly
   health service users, are rarely consulted on the knowledge base
   expected of practitioners. We report here on an evaluation, involving
   students, lecturers, nurses and service users, aimed at reviewing the
   bioscience component of the preregistration mental health nursing
   course. Students and lecturers agreed that the current common foundation
   course in bioscience was biased towards the adult branch students, and
   failed to meet the needs of mental health nurses. The mental health
   lecturers' solution to the `bioscience problem' was to curtail the
   input. In contrast, service users described serious shortfalls in
   professionals' abilities to inform them of common side-effects of
   medication; these problems were attributable to inadequate educational
   preparation. The knowledge deficits identified could be rectified by
   making pharmacology an important part of the mental health education
   programme. However, for the curriculum to accommodate applied
   pharmacology, its supporting bioscience, and essential preparation in
   psychosocial interventions, some restructuring of the biological science
   programme for mental health nurses will be necessary. Our findings
   suggest that such restructuring should be informed by service users'
   views of their needs.},

Abstract = {Promotion of good mental health in young people is important. Our aim
   was to evaluate the consistency and magnitude of the efficacy of
   universal/selective interventions to promote good mental health. A
   systematic PRISMA/RIGHT-compliant meta-analysis (PROSPERO:
   CRD42018088708) search of Web of Science until 04/31/2019 identified
   original studies comparing the efficacy of universal/selective
   interventions for good mental health vs a control group, in samples with
   a mean age < 35 years. Meta-analytical random-effects model,
   heterogeneity statistics, assessment of publication bias, study quality
   and sensitivity analyses investigated the efficacy (Hedges' g = effect
   size, ES) of universal/selective interventions to promote 14 good mental
   health outcomes defined a-priori. 276 studies were included (total
   participants: 159,508, 79,142 interventions and 80,366 controls), mean
   age = 15.0 (SD = 7.4); female = 56.0\%. There was a significant overall
   improvement in 10/13 good mental health outcome categories that could be
   meta-analysed: compared to controls, interventions significantly
   improved (in descending order of magnitude) mental health literacy (ES =
   0.685, p < 0.001), emotions (ES = 0.541, p < 0.001), self-perceptions
   and values (ES = 0.49, p < 0.001), quality of life (ES = 0.457, p =
   0.001), cognitive skills (ES = 0.428, p < 0.001), social skills (ES =
   0.371, p < 0.001), physical health (ES = 0.285, p < 0.001), sexual
   health (ES = 0.257, p = 0.017), academic/occupational performance (ES =
   0.211, p < 0.001) and attitude towards mental disorders (ES = 0.177, p =
   0.006). Psychoeducation was the most effective intervention for
   promoting mental health literacy (ES = 0.774, p < 0.001) and cognitive
   skills (ES = 1.153, p = 0.03). Physical therapy, exercise and relaxation
   were more effective than psychoeducation and psychotherapy for promoting
   physical health (ES= 0.498, p<0.001). In conclusion, several
   universal/selective interventions can be effective to promote good
   mental health in young people. Future research should consolidate and
   extend these findings. (c) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Title = {To Increase Mental Health Literacy and Human Rights Among New-Coming,
   Low-Educated Mothers With Experience of War: A Culturally, Tailor-Made
   Group Health Promotion Intervention With Participatory Methodology
   Addressing Indirectly the Children},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JUL 8},
Abstract = {Due to the increasing numbers of newcomers with impacts of war, civil
   war and persecution, at high risk of trauma-related mental health
   problems, there is a need for increase the poor mental health literacy
   (MHL) and human rights among the new-comers, especially low-educated
   mothers with children. This article aimed to present a case study report
   of several years' experience of tailor-made group health promotion
   intervention. It describes as an example, a project during autumn 2018
   in five municipalities of Sweden and in collaboration between academia,
   primary care, social welfare, police, and an NGO. Fifty-one women,
   Arabic- or Somalian speaking, with 1-7 children, mean age 40 years,
   low-educated and in average four years' of living in Sweden
   participated. Under supervision, a local female member of the NGO
   coordinated the group meetings in Swedish with up to ten participants
   and the moderators were representatives of healthcare, social services
   and police/lawyer, with an interpreter present. Each intervention
   focused on human rights, health including mental health, psychosocial
   and parenting support, by using a 5-week group intervention a 2 h/week,
   totally 10 h excluding pre- and post-evaluation, and one language per
   intervention. Each meeting included 1-h lecture and after a short break
   with refreshments, the participants asked questions to the respective
   moderator. It was a mixed method but emphasis on qualitative design and
   participatory methodology with co-creation and evaluation of the
   intervention. The results showed that this tailor-made group
   intervention gave the participants empowerment and a sense of coherence,
   MHL and tools to deal with stress/anxiety, based on their needs that
   were mapped before in a pilot study during Spring 2018, indirectly
   addressing their children. However, they did not primarily talk about
   mental illness experience. It is vital that these interventions toward
   the target group with limited exposure to Western concepts (e.g.,
   illness, anxiety, and trauma), may bridge the gap between Western and
   traditional cultural understanding of pre- and postmigration stress. In
   conclusion, MHL may be a function of both the cultural origin of the
   target group's background and their resettlement in a Western reception
   country. Implications are discussed.},

Title = {teen Mental Health First Aid as a school-based intervention for
   improving peer support of adolescents at risk of suicide: Outcomes from
   a cluster randomised crossover trial},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {54},

Pages = {382-392},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Objectives: The aims of this study were to assess evidence for a novel,
   universal mental health literacy programme in the school setting (teen
   Mental Health First Aid) as an intervention to improve peer support
   towards adolescents at risk of suicide and to examine whether
   participation in a school-based programme dealing with suicide was
   distressing to participants. Method: In a cluster randomised crossover
   trial, Australian high school students aged 15-17 years (N = 1605,
   44.74\% female, M-age = 15.87) received either teen Mental Health First
   Aid or a matched control physical first aid course. Data were collected
   before, immediately after and 12 months after training through online
   surveys assessing correct recognition of suicidality and intentions to
   help a fictional peer (John) who was depicted as experiencing depressive
   symptoms and suicidal thoughts in a vignette. Students were also asked
   whether any information in the training or surveys was found distressing
   and completed a validated measure of psychological distress (the Kessler
   Psychological Distress Scale). Results: Students receiving teen Mental
   Health First Aid training were much more likely to report an increase
   from pre- to post-training in recognition of suicidality (OR = 1.97,
   95\% CI = {[}1.14, 3.39], p = 0.02) and appropriate first aid intentions
   towards a peer at risk of suicide than students receiving physical first
   aid (OR = 35.40, 95\% CI = {[}19.86, 63.14], p < 0.001). Twelve months
   after training, most effects were still significant. Although a greater
   proportion of teen Mental Health First Aid participants self-reported
   feeling briefly distressed after the training, there was no evidence of
   greater distress at 12 months on the Kessler Psychological Distress
   Scale. Conclusion: teen Mental Health First Aid is effective in
   increasing recognition of and intentions to assist a suicidal peer.
   Although the open discussion of mental health first aid for a suicidal
   peer was distressing for some students, results suggest this was
   transient and not associated with harm. Future studies are required to
   ascertain whether these increases are indeed associated with better
   provision of support and prevention of youth suicide.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {13},
Month = {JUL 23},
Abstract = {This study explores the construction of a youth mental health-promoting
   campus ecosystem based on integrated research-practice teaching. In
   response to the fragmentation of traditional mental health education in
   Chinese universities, the model incorporates ecosystem theory, embodied
   cognition, and multi-agent collaboration to build a four-dimensional
   support system: curriculum-practice integration, internal-external
   stakeholder synergy, environmental optimization, and institutional
   sustainability. Through immersive practices like psychodrama, mind
   mapping, and mindful walking, students' psychological capital and
   self-regulation abilities are enhanced. The model emphasizes
   collaboration across psychological, educational, and managerial units,
   as well as coordination with families, communities, medical
   institutions, and enterprises. By combining physical space design with
   digital tracking platforms, the ecosystem enables all-scenario
   psychological support. Challenges such as insufficient longitudinal
   validation, ethical concerns in AI-driven interventions, and uneven
   resource allocation remain. This study provides a localized and
   actionable framework for advancing youth mental health in higher
   education, supporting a shift from crisis intervention to positive
   psychological development.},

   interview study},
Journal = {THEATRE DANCE AND PERFORMANCE TRAINING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Pages = {297-316},
Abstract = {Student actors in professional training are potentially vulnerable to
   difficulties with their psychological wellbeing, but there has been
   little research to date investigating the positive and negative impacts
   of this unique environment and training process. The current study uses
   contemporary psychological theory and qualitative methodology to explore
   the perceptions of both acting students and their trainers. Seven acting
   students and eight trainers from two institutions were interviewed
   in-depth and the data analysed using thematic analysis. The findings
   were clustered into three domains of experience: the conservatoire
   (environmental/cultural factors), acting training (process factors) and
   student qualities (individual factors). Influences on students'
   psychological wellbeing included: complex personal relationships,
   intense workload, chronic uncertainty, perfectionism, personal
   strengths, mental health difficulties, identity destabilisation, growth
   and feeling exposed. An important unresolved question arose: when is
   acting training dangerous? Practical implications included: building
   mental health literacy, increasing students' feelings of competence,
   fostering students' ability to tolerate stress and uncertainty and
   employing a specialist clinician. There is vast scope for future
   research, particularly in clarifying the wellbeing challenges in
   training and identifying appropriate, evidence-based interventions for
   use in this unique environment.},

Abstract = {Treating the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired

   approach for each individual element as well as society related to

   and critical structural factors in strengthening desired outcomes,
   especially in HIV/AIDS prevention. Some interventions aimed at
   increasing diversity of participants, and were mostly focused on
   overcoming individual-level of barriers to research participation. Most
   of the interventions did not evaluate their effectiveness on increasing
   the level of trial participation. Overall, there is little focus on
   interventions aimed at researchers, clinical trials, institutional
   policy factors, or studies. Therefore, a HIV/AIDS model of intervention
   is needed that emphasizes the inter-relationship of community elements,

Abstract = {Individual mental health has become a primary global concern. In
   Pakistan, the prevalence of mental health issues is still unclear, as
   not many studies have assessed the level of mental health literacy (MHL)
   in the country. This systematic review aims to bridge this gap by
   encouraging the early detection of mental disorders, lessening stigma,
   and improving help-seeking behavior. Nine electronic databases were
   searched to identify empirical literature in this area. Only studies
   that evaluated MHL efficacy and those published in English were
   selected. Non-peer reviewed articles and gray literature were excluded.
   From 613 studies retrieved, 59 studies met the inclusion criteria and
   were reviewed. Forty-three of the included studies mentioned mental
   health outcome measures (of which only four mentioned reliability
   indices), 13 discussed stigma, 18 examined help-seeking approaches to
   mental illness treatments, and 47 discussed mental health knowledge.
   Additionally, the outcome of the MHL measures had considerable
   heterogeneity and limited validity. Meta-analysis was not conducted due
   to a lack of MHL operationalization. Besides, the measurement tools in
   the studies lacked consistency and standardization. This review compiled
   the available studies on MHL to assist researchers currently studying
   the various dimensions of MHL, as well as those designing new studies or
   investigating effective methods to increase MHL. This review highlights
   the need for well-designed controlled intervention studies. Further
   implications for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers are
   mentioned.},

Abstract = {Recent workforce trends in healthcare point to a growing need to prepare
   social workers capable of providing integrated behavioral health care in
   multidisciplinary settings serving at-risk youth. This article reports
   on a project that involved the development and implementation of a
   graduate-level social work specialization focused on integrated
   behavioral health practice with children and adolescents. This
   specialization offered targeted curriculum, interprofessional education
   experiences and specialized mentoring and field opportunities to
   second-year, advanced, clinical master's students interested in working
   with at-risk children and adolescents. Outcomes and implementation
   processes were evaluated using a mixed methods approach. Findings
   included improvement of mental health literacy, a strengthening of
   professional social work identity and an enhanced commitment to serving
   youth populations. Engaging in a community of practice was identified as
   important for enhancing self-efficacy and professional identity. The
   creation of intentional communities of practice that help social workers
   develop skills through the engagement of targeted social practices
   embedded within interprofessional networks represents an important area
   of future study. Longitudinal research exploring the long-term impact of
   practice specializations on the behavioral health workforce are

Abstract = {In recent times, global crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, climate
   change, and geopolitical conflicts have significantly impacted pupils'
   mental health. This opinion article presents evidence-based
   recommendations to bolster mental health support within educational
   systems, aiming to alleviate the psychological burden faced by students
   during these challenging times. This article argues that a proactive,
   holistic approach to mental health is essential for building a resilient
   educational infrastructure. More than ever, we support the call for the
   integration of mental health education into the core curriculum,
   equipping students with vital coping skills and fostering emotional
   intelligence. Additionally, we emphasize the importance of training
   educators and staff to identify and address mental health issues.
   Furthermore, this article highlights the need for interdisciplinary
   collaboration involving general practitioners, mental health
   professionals, community organizations, and policymakers in crafting and
   implementing support strategies. Educational institutions can
   effectively leverage the expertise of diverse stakeholders to create
   targeted interventions by cultivating partnerships. Finally, the
   significance of continuously evaluating and refining mental health
   support policies to ensure their efficacy and adaptability in the face
   of evolving crises is emphasized. Through these comprehensive
   recommendations, this opinion article seeks to catalyze a transformation
   in educational policies, prioritize mental health support, and empower
   pupils to thrive during tumultuous times.},

Abstract = {Rational emotive behaviour therapy (REBT) is effective in reducing
   distress in several target groups. No other study has tested the mental
   health effects on adolescents in a high school setting while expanding a
   Cognitive Behaviour-based therapy, REBT, into the concept of mental
   health literacy. The format of the ABC model, which is an important
   element of REBT, functioned as a working manual in and between three
   sessions. This study tested whether knowledge and practical use of the
   ABC model increased self-esteem and hope, and reduced symptoms of
   anxiety and depression, and dysfunctional thinking. Sixty-two high
   school students with subclinical levels of anxiety and depression were
   randomly allocated into three groups; three individual REBT sessions, or
   three individual attentional placebo (ATP) sessions or no sessions
   (control). However, dysfunctional thinking, self-esteem and hope were
   not measured in the control group. Repeated measures with ANOVA and
   t-tests were conducted. Both REBT and ATP significantly reduced symptoms
   of anxiety and depression, but only REBT was significantly different
   from the control group at the six-month follow-up. Only REBT
   significantly reduced dysfunctional thinking, and both REBT and ATP
   significantly increased self-esteem and hope. REBT had both an immediate
   and a long-term effect. The findings show the potential positive effects
   of educating well-documented psychological techniques as ordinary
   education in school. Further research might contribute to decide whether
   or not to change the school system by enclosing mental health literacy
   classes for all students.},

Title = {Localising the Partners in Parenting program for Malaysia (PiP
   Malaysia): A qualitative study of cultural considerations},
Journal = {CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {172},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In Malaysia, parental concerns about adolescent mental health have
   increased exponentially in recent years. However, parental mental health
   literacy remains low and culturally-sensitive parenting resources are
   scarce in Malaysia. The Partners in Parenting (PiP) program provides a
   framework of evidence-based parenting domains (henceforth `PiP
   framework') that are universally adaptive for adolescent mental
   health-presenting as a good candidate for implementation in other
   cultures. Guided by the Double Diamond framework, this study aimed to
   identify cultural considerations for localising PiP to the Malaysian
   context. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 38 primary
   caregivers (Mage = 47.1 years), who reflected on their parenting of
   their children during adolescence (aged 12-17 years). A thematic
   analysis using a deductive approach was conducted, using the PiP
   framework as a reference to identify cultural considerations in relation
   to five selected PiP parenting domains. Four overarching themes
   describing these cultural considerations were identified-Religion,
   Extended family, Gender roles, and Intergenerational influences-which
   were each relevant to one or more PiP parenting domains. These
   considerations, which reflect the complex interplay between parenting
   practices and the broader sociocultural environment in Malaysia, were
   further organised and interpreted within the context of the five
   interconnected cultural systems of the Bronfenbrenner socioecological
   model. Our approach facilitated a strategic, targeted localisation
   process, by identifying cultural considerations to be integrated into
   evidence-based intervention content. The context-specific implications
   for the localisation of PiP for Malaysia are discussed.},

Title = {Mental health first aid training among healthcare French students: a
   qualitative study},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 23},
Abstract = {BackgroundHealthcare students are a population more at risk for mental
   health issues, especially anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts.
   The health faculty of Universite Paris Cite in France, Paris has
   implemented a Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) course aiming to improve
   students' mental health literacy, self-care and peer-support and to
   decrease stigma about mental illness. We conducted a qualitative study
   exploring the lived experience of this MHFA training course among
   healthcare students so to better assess its implementation within this
   specific context and population.MethodsThis qualitative study used the
   five-stage inductive process to analyze the structure of lived
   experience (IPSE) approach. All the healthcare students that had
   completed the 2-day MHFA training were approached to participate. Data
   was collected through individual semi-structured interviews and
   inclusion continued until data saturation was reached. Data analysis was
   based on an inductive, descriptive, and structuring procedure to
   determine the structure of lived experience characterized by the central
   axes of experience.ResultsTwenty students were included. Data analysis
   produced a common structure of lived experience based on three central
   axes of experience, (1) a personal experience, (2) a student experience
   and (3) a professional experience. The participants all experienced this
   course intertwined within these 3 axes. Their motivation to take the
   course was personal -being of feeling concerned by the topic-, was
   study-oriented - to learn and revise psychiatry- and was professional -
   so to develop both practical and soft skills. In their personal
   experience, participants reported a transformative experience and some
   interventions with friends and family, while both in their student and
   professional experience, they felt frustrated with both the content and
   the form of the course.ConclusionThe results reported similar outcomes
   reported in the literature about skills, knowledge, and awareness; but
   mostly produce original avenues about how to better adapt such course to
   this specific population so to better address students' expectations and
   mental health issues. This MHFA course -with an adapted content
   addressing eating disorders, self-mutilations and sexual and
   gender-based violence - could be part of the early curriculum of
   healthcare students. The latter could then benefit from a level
   2/advanced MHFA course years later specifically tailored for healthcare
   professionals.},

Abstract = {Mental health disorders are common and have a significantly negative
   impact on the health and well-being of women. For example, perinatal
   mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression are widely
   understood to be the most common complications of pregnancy and
   childbirth. Untreated mental health disorders are associated with
   significant obstetrical and psychiatric sequelae and have a long-lasting
   impact on neonatal and childhood outcomes. As front-line providers for
   women during times of elevated risk of psychiatric morbidity, such as
   pregnancy and postpartum, obstetricians and gynecologists are compelled
   to have familiarity with such disorders. Yet, a wide gap exists between
   the level of education in mental health disorders that obstetrician and
   gynecologist providers receive and the clinical need thereof. The
   objectives of this commentary are to describe the urgent need for mental
   health education for obstetricians and gynecologists providers and to
   introduce our vision for a concise, evidencebased and accessible set of
   digital educational materials designed to convey core concepts in
   women's reproductive mental health.},

Abstract = {This research aims to examine the contribution of physical activity to
   children's mental health education during the epidemic era. In this
   study, 50 5-to 6-year-old children from a city were recruited as
   research subjects using interviews, literature review, and experimental
   statistics and then randomly divided into two groups: the experimental
   group and the control group. The psychological index data before and
   after the happy exercise were measured using a questionnaire survey. The
   psychological index data before and after 12 weeks of experimental
   practice were evaluated using data statistics. Six mental health indices
   demonstrated a significant difference between the experimental group and
   the control group, with the improvement value of the experimental
   group's movement score being 3.68 and the improvement value of the
   control group's movement score being 0.15. Social score improvement in
   the experimental group was 1.76, whereas, in the control group, it was
   0.12. The value of language score improvement was 1.16, while the
   language score improvement in the control group was 0.14. The gymnastics
   sports curriculum is favorable to the mental health development of
   56-year -old children and has significantly enhanced children's mental
   health.},

Title = {Increased belongingness as a mechanism of change of school-based
   programs mitigating suicidal ideation among adolescents},
Journal = {EUROPEAN CHILD \& ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 NOV 26},
Abstract = {Suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents, highlighting the
   importance of early intervention in school settings. Universal mental
   health awareness programs, aimed at improving mental health literacy and
   help-seeking behaviors, are a key preventive approach. This study
   examined whether changes in thwarted belongingness and perceived
   burdensomeness-two constructs from the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide
   (IPTS)-mediate the effects of school-based mental health interventions
   on suicidal ideation (SI). A total of 436 adolescents from central
   Israel (154 boys, 279 girls; M = 14.6, SD = 1.1) were randomly assigned
   to either a mental health awareness intervention (N = 256) or a
   minimal-intervention control group with attendance monitoring (N = 180).
   Belongingness, burdensomeness, and SI were assessed at baseline,
   1-month, and 1-year post-intervention. Regression analyses showed that
   lower belongingness (beta = -0.25, p < .001) and higher burdensomeness
   (beta = 0.21, p < .01) predicted higher SI at 1-month, while only
   belongingness remained significant at 1-year (beta = -0.19, p < .01).
   The mental health awareness intervention increased school-specific
   belongingness (beta = 0.22, p < .001), whereas attendance monitoring
   intervention increased general belongingness (beta = 0.18, p < .01).
   Mediation analysis indicated that the effects of the intervention type
   on SI were not significantly mediated by general and school
   belongingness. These findings suggest that promoting broader social
   connectedness beyond school environments may support reductions in
   adolescent suicide risk over time.},

Abstract = {No empirical study has examined the effect of artwork created by people
   with mental health problems on the attitudes of nursing and social work
   students, separately in those who had had and had not had past close
   contact with those individuals. We preliminarily investigated whether an
   educational program using artwork created by people with mental health
   problems could promote positive attitudes among nursing and social work
   students in Japan, regardless of past close contact experiences. A
   pre-/post-comparison design survey was conducted at two universities and
   two colleges in Japan. A total of 307 nursing and social work students
   rated their attitudes on a semantic differential attitude scale at both
   pre-program (T1) and post-program (T2) stages. Wilcoxon's signed rank
   tests revealed that participants showed more neutral to positive
   attitudes toward people with mental health problems at T2 than at T1,
   regardless of past close contact with individuals with such problems.
   The findings imply that our educational program provided participants
   with new perspectives of people with mental health problems, which were
   different from those provided by basic mental health education or
   obtained through close contact. Nursing and social work education that
   utilizes artwork created by people with mental health problems may
   cultivate sympathetic and positive attitudes toward those individuals.},

Title = {The Impact of Video-Based Microinterventions on Attitudes Toward Mental
   Health and Help Seeking in Youth: Web-Based Randomized Controlled Trial},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {26},
Month = {APR 24},
Abstract = {Background: Mental health (MH) problems in youth are prevalent,
   burdening, and frequently persistent. Despite the existence of effective
   treatment, the uptake of professional help is low, particularly due to
   attitudinal barriers. Objective: This study evaluated the effectiveness
   and acceptability of 2 video -based microinterventions aimed at reducing
   barriers to MH treatment and increasing the likelihood of seeking
   professional help in young people. Methods: This study was entirely web
   based and open access. The interventions addressed 5 MH problems:
   generalized anxiety disorder, depression, bulimia, nonsuicidal self
   -injury, and problematic alcohol use. Intervention 1 aimed to
   destigmatize and improve MH literacy, whereas intervention 2 aimed to
   induce positive outcome expectancies regarding professional help
   seeking. Of the 2435 participants who commenced the study, a final
   sample of 1394 (57.25\%) participants aged 14 to 29 years with complete
   data and sufficient durations of stay on the video pages were randomized
   in a fully automated manner to 1 of the 5 MH problems and 1 of 3
   conditions (control, intervention 1, and intervention 2) in a permuted
   block design. After the presentation of a video vignette, no further
   videos were shown to the control group, whereas a second, short
   intervention video was presented to the intervention 1 and 2 groups.
   Intervention effects on self -reported potential professional help
   seeking (primary outcome), stigma, and attitudes toward help seeking
   were examined using analyses of covariance across and within the 5 MH
   problems. Furthermore, we assessed video acceptability. Results: No
   significant group effects on potential professional help seeking were
   found in the total sample ( F 2,1385 =0.99; P =.37). However, the groups
   differed significantly with regard to stigma outcomes and the likelihood
   of seeking informal help ( F 2,1385 = 3 . 75 ; P =.02). Furthermore,
   separate analyses indicated substantial differences in intervention
   effects among the 5 MH problems. Conclusions: Interventions to promote
   help seeking for MH problems may require disorder -specific approaches.
   The study results can inform future research and public health campaigns
   addressing adolescents and young adults.},

Abstract = {Using data collected on a two-wave longitudinal sample of 910
   adolescents with mean age of 13.68years in Hong Kong, China, this survey
   aimed to test a moderated mediation model to account for the
   developmental pathway from childhood experiences of neglect to suicidal
   ideation in adolescents. Results showed that adolescents who were
   neglected as children had higher levels of suicidal ideation;
   furthermore, this relation was mediated by adolescents' depressive
   symptoms, while the path between adolescents' depressive symptoms and
   suicidal ideation was moderated by adolescents' sense of hope. Findings
   of this study imply that intervention and services that help prevent
   childhood neglect, alleviate depression, and promote hope are
   potentially important to decrease adolescent suicidal ideation.},

Title = {Developing an Intervention to Improve the Health Related Quality of Life
   in Children and Young People With Serious Parental Mental Illness},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Month = {APR 9},
Abstract = {Introduction: Children and adolescents living with parental mental
   illness (CAPRI) are at increased risk of behavioral, social and
   educational difficulties, mental and physical health problems and have
   poorer quality of life (QoL). Adverse outcomes can extend into adulthood
   but are not inevitable. Recent policy and stakeholder consultation
   recognize the urgent need for interventions that extend beyond
   objective, service-led measures of health. Systematic evidence synthesis
   has demonstrated a lack of evidence-based interventions for enhancing
   holistic, child-centered outcomes. We aimed to co-develop a manualised,
   community-based intervention to improve QoL in CAPRI. Precedence was
   given to the QoL domains that were prioritized by stakeholders and
   deemed feasible to modify within a health and social care context. We
   describe here the modeling phase of developing the intervention
   emphasizing co-production activities with CAPRI, their families and
   professionals who support them.
   Methods: Semi-structured interviews and focus groups with CAPRI (n =
   14), parents (n = 7), and professionals from health, social and
   educational sectors (n = 31) in the UK. Topic guides qualitatively
   explored participants prior experiences, unmet needs, perceived barriers
   and facilitators to receiving/delivering support, and their ideals for a
   new intervention. Findings were synthesized with existing research
   evidence and presented to a mixed panel of clinical academics and health
   and social care professionals. A consensus exercise was used to identify
   the preferred structure, format and content of the manualised
   intervention.
   Results: An 8-week group intervention for 6-16 year olds and their
   parents, called Young SMILES, has been co-developed along with
   associated training materials for facilitators. Each session addresses
   an identified need, but is underpinned by cross-cutting themes
   pertaining to mental health literacy, parent-child communication, and
   problem solving skills. Sessions are delivered by two trained
   facilitators and held in accessible and acceptable community locations
   weekly for 2 h.
   Conclusion: Young SMILES captures a broad age range and level of need
   for CAPRI and can be evaluated with quantifiable child-centered
   outcomes. In line with current policy directives, this is the first
   UK-based, multi-context intervention to improve QoL in this population.
   Implementation and referral mechanisms are currently being evaluated in
   a multi-site feasibility trial.},

Title = {Skill Enactment and Knowledge Acquisition in Digital Cognitive
   Behavioral Therapy for Depression and Anxiety: Systematic Review of
   Randomized Controlled Trials},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Month = {MAY 31},
Abstract = {Background: Digital cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) interventions can
   effectively prevent and treat depression and anxiety, but engagement
   with these programs is often low. Although extensive research has
   evaluated program use as a proxy for engagement, the extent to which
   users acquire knowledge and enact skills from these programs has been
   largely overlooked. Objective: This study aimed to investigate how skill
   enactment and knowledge acquisition have been measured, evaluate
   postintervention changes in skill enactment and knowledge acquisition,
   examine whether mental health outcomes are associated with skill
   enactment or knowledge acquisition, and evaluate predictors of skill
   enactment and knowledge acquisition. Methods: PubMed, PsycINFO, and
   Cochrane CENTRAL were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
   published between January 2000 and July 2022. We included RCTs comparing
   digital CBT with any comparison group in adolescents or adults (aged =12
   years) for anxiety or depression. Eligible studies reported quantitative
   measures of skill enactment or knowledge acquisition. The methodological
   quality of the studies was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute
   Critical Appraisal Checklist for RCTs. Narrative synthesis was used to
   address the review questions. Results: In total, 43 papers were
   included, of which 29 (67\%) reported a skill enactment measure and 15
   (35\%) reported a knowledge acquisition measure. Skill enactment was
   typically operationalized as the frequency of enacting skills using the
   completion of in-program activities (ie, formal skill enactment; 13/29,
   45\%) and intervention-specific (9/29, 31\%) or standardized (8/29,
   28\%) questionnaires. Knowledge measures included tests of CBT knowledge
   (6/15, 40\%) or mental health literacy (5/15, 33\%) and self-report
   questionnaires (6/15, 40\%). In total, 17 studies evaluated
   postintervention changes in skill enactment or knowledge acquisition,
   and findings were mostly significant for skill enactment (6/8, 75\% of
   the studies), CBT knowledge (6/6, 100\%), and mental health literacy
   (4/5, 80\%). Of the 12 studies that evaluated the association between
   skill enactment and postintervention mental health outcomes, most
   reported >= 1 significant positive finding on standardized
   questionnaires (4/4, 100\%), formal skill enactment indicators (5/7,
   71\%), or intervention-specific questionnaires (1/1, 100\%). None of the
   4 studies that evaluated the association between knowledge acquisition
   and primary mental health outcomes reported significant results. A total
   of 13 studies investigated predictors of skill enactment; only type of
   guidance and improvements in psychological variables were associated
   with increased skill enactment in >= 2 analyses. Predictors of knowledge
   acquisition were evaluated in 2 studies. Conclusions: Digital CBT for
   depression and anxiety can improve skill enactment and knowledge
   acquisition. However, only skill enactment appears to be associated with
   mental health outcomes, which may depend on the type of measure
   examined. Additional research is needed to understand what types and
   levels of skill enactment and knowledge acquisition are most relevant
   for outcomes and identify predictors of these constructs.},

Abstract = {Children living in Defence families affected by parental mental illness
   face increased stressors, pressure for self-sufficiency and potential
   exposure to adverse outcomes, including future mental illness. Little is
   known about the impact of mental health early interventions on the
   help-seeking tendencies of military young people affected by parental
   mental illness. Similarly, the responsivity of this cohort to peer-based
   mental health literacy interventions aimed to dispel misconceptions and
   stigmatising beliefs about mental illness and help-seeking is not well
   understood. The current study measured key aspects of belief-related
   mental health knowledge and intentions to seek help from a range of
   formal and informal sources of 236 Australian young people aged 7-18
   years, living with parents affected by military-associated mental health
   problems. Findings suggest that young people in the Defence community
   are most likely to seek help from their parents and show changes in
   beliefs about mental illness and intentions to seek help from some help
   sources following a brief (2-hour) group intervention. Help-seeking
   intentions from telephone helplines increased for the cohort, and males
   were more inclined to seek help from a friend after intervention.
   Limitations including the absence of a comparison or control group,
   issues in data measurement protocols and a need for long-term follow-up
   were future research directions.},

Number = {3},
Pages = {224-228},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Aim: With the movement of early detection and intervention for people at
   risk for psychosis, there is a growing need for a uniform terminology to
   describe the condition. A diagnostic label that can adapt into local
   culture and value may have positive effect in minimizing stigma. This
   study explored the preference of Chinese label for people at risk of
   psychosis and its associated stigma in Hong Kong.
   Methods: A total of 149 individuals from the general public and 51
   health-care professionals were recruited between March 2013 and May
   2014. The condition of at risk for psychosis was described in a
   vignette. Participants' preference of label and perceived stigma of the
   condition and their basic demographics were collected by
   self-administered questionnaires.
   Results: The most preferred Chinese label was yun-niang-qi' (developing
   period, 45\%), followed by qian-qu-qi' (precursor period, 19\%),
   feng-xian-qi' (risky period, 18\%), zao-xian-qi' (early sign period,
   16\%) and gao-wei-qi' (high risk period, 4\%). Gender, age, occupation
   and previous contact with mental health were not associated with
   preference of any Chinese label.
   Conclusions: The process in searching for this potential and locally
   accepted label for people at risk for psychosis has raised the awareness
   among the professionals. A proper label may help promote future clinical
   research and mental health services in Hong Kong.},

Abstract = {Background: Simulated patients (SPs) in mental health nursing education
   provide a unique approach to assist student development in complex
   assessment skills.
   Purpose: The purpose of this international multisite study was to
   evaluate the use of two diverse mental health SP simulation scenarios on
   nursing students' satisfaction and self-confidence in learning to care
   for patients with mental health disorders in the United States (n = 70)
   and Turkey (n = 90).
   Methods: A multisite cross-sectional study design was used. Outcome
   measures included the Student Satisfaction and Self-confidence in
   Learning Scale and the adapted Simulation Effectiveness Tool Modified.
   Results were analyzed using independent I tests.
   Results: While students in the United States reported higher perceived
   self-confidence and satisfaction in learning, both student populations
   found the intervention effective to their learning (P<.05).
   Conclusion: Using SPs in mental health education allow students to
   practice their assessment skills learned in classroom and transfer them
   to the clinical area.},

Abstract = {Objective: To present the translation and cross-cultural adaptation of a
   social anxiety vignette in adolescents into European Portuguese and the
   consequent integration in the Mental Health Literacy Assessment
   Questionnaire - QuALiSMental. Method: A methodological study of
   translation and cross-cultural adaptation of a social anxiety vignette
   in adolescents into European Portuguese was carried out, according to
   the stages: 1) translation; 2) synthesis of translations; 3)
   back-translation; 4) synthesis of back-translations; 5) panel of experts
   with eight professionals from different areas of health; 5) cognitive
   debriefing integrating six adolescents with an average age of 14.33
   years (SD = 0.52); 6) review and final report. Throughout this process,
   we have taken into account the ethical considerations. Results: A
   vignette of social anxiety was obtained in the teenagers ``Joao{''} and
   ``Joana{''} in European Portuguese. We highlight the results related to
   the stages: the panel of experts and cognitive debriefing. Consensus
   criteria were obtained among experts for semantic and idiomatic
   equivalence, experiential and cultural equivalence, and conceptual
   equivalence. In the cognitive debriefing, a 100\% agreement was found
   regarding the clarity of the vignette's content in the European
   Portuguese. Conclusions: This vignette can be used in clinical practice
   at different levels of care, education/training, and research.
   Integrated with QuALiSMental allows the assessment of mental health
   literacy on anxiety in adolescents in different contexts and/or
   assessments of psychoeducational interventions' effectiveness in this
   area.},

Title = {An exploration of an interprofessional approach to perinatal mental
   health education: A qualitative descriptive study},
Journal = {MIDWIFERY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {148},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Aim/Objective: This study aims to explore and evaluate postgraduate
   student experiences of a perinatal mental health education programme and
   to explore the value of collaborative learning within an
   interprofessional group. Background: Evidence highlights the need for
   accessible mental health care during the perinatal period from educated
   and skilled healthcare professionals. Until recently, there has been a
   lack of emphasis on perinatal mental health care provision and a
   subsequent lack of education and training in the area for healthcare
   professionals. Design: A qualitative descriptive research study was
   conducted to evaluate an interprofessional approach to perinatal mental
   health education. Participants: A purposive sample of postgraduate
   healthcare professionals (n = 10) who completed the first year of the
   Master of Science in Perinatal Mental Health programme or who had
   completed relevant standalone modules, at a Higher Education Institute
   in Ireland, participated in the study. Methods: Data collection were
   conducted via four online small-group discussions and thematic analysis
   was utilised to analyse the narrative data. Results: Three themes
   illustrate participants' experiences of the perinatal mental health
   programme: Learning with other professionals, Enhanced confidence for
   clinical practice and Challenges of the programme. Conclusion: By
   undertaking the perinatal mental health programme/modules participants
   were provided with opportunities to engage in interprofessional
   education. The programme offered opportunities for developing networking
   relationships which continued into clinical practice. Participants
   acknowledged the benefits of the programme in acquiring specialist
   knowledge and skills regarding the spectrum of perinatal mental health
   enhancing clinical assessment, communication, and confidence in care
   provision.},

Abstract = {This article summarizes literature about paraprofessionals who assist

   are paraprofessionals?; what are the common and appropriate roles and
   responsibilities of paraprofessionals?; and what qualifications,
   training, and supervision are needed for paraprofessionals? Implications
   are inferred for a burgeoning new form of paraprofessional services:
   attendant care in community based mental health services for children.
   Lessons from existing literature can help mental health administrators
   and clinical supervisors at state and local levels to select, train,
   supervise, and evaluate attendant care workers.},

Title = {Increasing demand for school counselling through a lay
   counsellor-delivered classroom sensitisation intervention: a
   stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial in New Delhi, India},
Journal = {BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {6},
Number = {6},
Abstract = {Introduction We evaluated a classroom-based sensitisation intervention
   that was designed to reduce demand-side barriers affecting referrals to
   a school counselling programme. The sensitisation intervention was
   offered in the context of a host trial evaluating a low-intensity
   problem-solving treatment for common adolescent mental health problems.
   Methods We conducted a stepped-wedge, cluster randomised controlled
   trial with 70 classes in 6 secondary schools serving low-income
   communities in New Delhi, India. The classes were randomised to receive
   a classroom sensitisation session involving a brief video presentation
   and moderated group discussion, delivered by a lay counsellor over one
   class period (intervention condition, IC), in two steps of 4 weeks each.
   The control condition (CC) was whole-school sensitisation
   (teacher-meetings and whole-school activities such as poster displays).
   The primary outcome was the proportion of students referred into the
   host trial. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of students who met
   mental health caseness criteria and the proportion of self-referred
   adolescents.
   Results Between 20 August 2018 and 9 December 2018, 835 students (23.3\%
   of all students) were referred into the host trial. The referred sample
   included 591 boys (70.8\%), and had a mean age of 15.8 years, SD=0.06;
   194 students (31.8\% of 610 with complete data) met mental health
   caseness criteria. The proportion of students referred in each trial
   conditionwas significantly higher in the IC (IC=21.7\%, CC=1.5\%,
   OR=111.36, 95\% CI 35.56 to 348.77, p<0.001). The proportion of
   self-referred participants was also higher in the IC (IC=98.1\%,
   CC=89.1\%, Pearson chi(2) (1)=16.92, p<0.001). Although the proportion
   of referred students meeting caseness criteria was similar in both
   conditions (IC=32.0\% vs CC=28.1\%), the proportion weighted for the
   total student population was substantially higher in the IC (IC=5.2\%,
   CC=0.3\%, OR=52.39, 95\% CI 12.49 to 219.66, p<0.001).
   Conclusion A single, lay counsellor-delivered, classroom sensitisation
   session increased psychological help-seeking for common mental health
   problems among secondary school pupils from urban, low-income
   communities in India.},

Abstract = {Objective We aimed to identify Australian adults' current level of
   confidence and intentions to help a person close to them in distress or
   at risk of suicide to inform the content and targeting of suicide
   prevention messages aimed at family and friends of those at risk.
   Methods We conducted a nationally representative computer-assisted
   telephone survey of confidence and intentions to help someone in
   distress or at risk of suicide (n = 3,002). We used logistic regression
   to determine whether sociodemographic and exposure variables predicted
   confidence and intentions to help. Results Confidence to help was high.
   About half of the respondents had intentions inconsistent with best
   practice. Listening and talking, and encouraging the person to seek
   professional help were the most common types of intended helping
   actions. Intentions to ask suicide risk assessment questions were least
   common. Men were more likely than women to have intentions to carry out
   nonrecommended actions, and less likely to have intentions to carry out
   recommended actions. Conclusions Suicide prevention messaging aimed at
   family and friends could encourage them to ask direct questions about
   suicide risk and could include messages about ``what not to do.{''}
   Suicide prevention messages aimed specifically at men are indicated.},

Abstract = {Mindfulness has been widely shown to enhance attention, yet its effects
   on different attentional functions and the required intervention
   duration remain inconsistent. Precise findings regarding attentional
   improvements can inform targeted interventions for specific ADHD
   subtypes. This study investigated the temporal progression of
   improvements in attentional functions during mindfulness interventions
   using a longitudinal design. A total of 116 participants were randomly
   assigned to three groups: mindfulness meditation (n = 39), music
   relaxation (n = 39), and mental health education (n = 38). Ultimately,
   90 participants (30 per group) completed the study. Baseline data were
   collected through demographic questionnaires, the Toronto Mindfulness
   Scale (TMS), a psychological distress questionnaire, and the Attention
   Network Test (ANT). During the five-week intervention, participants
   practiced their assigned activities for 10 min daily (excluding
   weekends) and completed state mindfulness assessments and ANT testing at
   weeks 1, 3, and 5. After controlling for baseline measures, no
   significant linear increase in state mindfulness was found across the
   groups. However, the mindfulness group demonstrated significant and
   sustained improvements in executive control from the first week onward,
   outperforming the control groups. In contrast, no significant changes
   were observed in alerting or orienting functions throughout the
   intervention. These findings suggest that mindfulness primarily enhances
   executive control, while its effects on alerting and orienting functions
   remain unclear and warrant further investigation.},

Title = {Early intervention for stigma towards mental illness? Promoting positive
   attitudes towards severe mental illness in primary school children},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {188-199},
Abstract = {Purpose - Stigma towards severe mental illness (SMI) is widespread,
   exacerbating mental health problems, and impacting on help-seeking and
   social inclusion. Anti-stigma campaigns are meeting with success, but
   results are mixed. Earlier intervention to promote positive mental
   health literacy rather than challenge stigma, may show promise, but
   little is known about stigma development or interventions in younger
   children. The purpose of this paper is to investigate children's
   knowledge, attitudes and behaviour towards SMI and whether we can
   positively influence children's attitudes before stigma develops.
   Design/methodology/approach - A cross-sectional study investigated
   mental health schema in 7-11 year olds. An experimental intervention
   investigated whether an indirect contact story-based intervention in 7-8
   year olds led to more positive mental health schema.
   Findings - Young children's schema were initially positive, and
   influenced by knowledge and contact with mental illness and intergroup
   anxiety, but were more stigmatising in older girls as intergroup anxiety
   increased. The indirect contact intervention was effective in promoting
   positive mental health schema, partially mediated by knowledge.
   Social implications - Intervening early to shape concepts of mental
   illness more positively, as they develop in young children, may
   represent a more effective strategy than attempting to challenge and
   change mental health stigma once it has formed in adolescents and
   adults.
   Originality/value - This study is the first to investigate an
   intervention targeted at the prevention of stigma towards SMI, in young
   children, at the point that stigma is emerging.},

Pages = {1237-1245},

Abstract = {An efficacious treatment is diminished in value if consumers do not seek
   it out and adhere to it, making treatment acceptability an important
   predictor of the effectiveness of treatment. This study examined the
   acceptability of treatments for depression to 67 female high school
   students. All participants read a vignette describing a depressed
   adolescent and rated the acceptability of four single treatments for
   depression (cognitive-behavioral therapy, interpersonal therapy, family
   therapy, and pharmacotherapy) and three treatment combinations.
   Psychotherapy approaches were generally more acceptable to adolescents
   than combinations of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy; and,
   pharmacotherapy used alone was not acceptable. For interpersonal therapy
   and family therapy only, treatment acceptability was related to
   perceived causes of depression. Across all treatments, acceptability was
   not associated with symptom severity. Implications for increasing the
   utilization of mental health services in this population are discussed.

Title = {A scoping review of the implementation and cultural adaptation of

   low-and middle-income countries},
Journal = {CAMBRIDGE PRISMS-GLOBAL MENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},
Month = {APR 12},
Abstract = {Effective school-based mental health promotion and prevention
   interventions in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) can positively
   impact the mental health and well-being of large numbers of young
   people. This scoping review aimed to investigate the implementation of
   effective mental health promotion and prevention interventions in LMIC
   schools. A scoping review of the international literature was conducted
   and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and
   Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. Medline,
   PsycInfo, Scopus, Embase, CINAHL and Cochrane were searched for
   peer-reviewed literature published from 2014 to 2022. PsycExtra, Google
   Scholar and the websites of key organisations were searched for relevant
   grey literature. Study selection focussed on mental health promotion
   interventions, including the development of social and emotional skills
   and mental health literacy, and prevention interventions, including
   anti-bullying and skill-based interventions for ``at-risk{''} students.
   Twenty-seven studies evaluating 25 school-based interventions in 17
   LMICs were included in the review. Fifteen interventions were developed
   in the implementing country and 10 were adapted from high-income
   countries (HICs) or other settings. Findings from the studies reviewed
   were generally positive, especially when interventions were implemented
   to a high quality. Universal life-skills interventions were found to
   increase social and emotional skills, decrease problem behaviours and
   positively impact students' mental health and well-being. Mental health
   literacy interventions increased mental health knowledge and decreased
   stigma among students and school staff. Outcomes for externally
   facilitated anti-bullying interventions were less positive. All 19
   effective studies reported on some aspects of programme implementation,
   and 15 monitored implementation fidelity. Eleven studies outlined the
   programme's underpinning theoretical model. Only four studies reported
   on the cultural adaptation of programmes in detail. Including young
   people in the adaptation process was reported to facilitate natural
   cultural adaptation of programmes, while input from programme developers
   was considered key to ensuring that the core components of interventions
   were retained. The review findings indicate increasing evidence of
   effective mental health interventions in LMIC schools. To facilitate the
   sustainability, replication and scaling-up of these interventions,
   greater attention is needed to reporting on intervention core
   components, and the processes of implementation and cultural adaptation
   in the local setting.},

Title = {Types and effectiveness of mental health promotion programmes for young

Journal = {CAMBRIDGE PRISMS-GLOBAL MENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {12},
Month = {JAN 9},
Abstract = {Studies show that mental health promotion is an effective strategy that
   can reduce the burden of mental health disorders and improve overall
   well-being in both children and adults. In addition to promoting high
   levels of mental well-being and preventing the onset of mental illness,
   these mental health promotion programmes, including mental illness
   prevention interventions, help increase levels of mental health literacy
   in community members. While there is evidence showing the effectiveness
   of mental health promotion, much of what is known about this field is
   informed by studies conducted in high-income countries. There is a need
   to gather evidence about the effectiveness of such interventions in low-
   and middle-income countries (LMICs) where mental health services are
   often inadequate. In this systematic review, we synthesised the
   available published primary evidence from sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) on
   the types and effectiveness of mental health promotion programmes for
   young people. We performed a search of selected global databases
   (PubMed, PsycINFO, ScienceDirect and Google Scholar) and regional
   databases (Sabinet African Journals). We included observational, mixed
   methods, trials, pilots and quantitative original papers published from
   2013 to 2023. We used the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) to
   evaluate the quality of methods in selected studies, and the Preferred
   Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement
   (PRISMA-2020) for reporting the evidence gathered. We identified 15
   types of youth mental health promotion and illness prevention
   interventions. Among those identified, we found that school-based
   interventions enhanced mental health literacy, mental health-seeking
   behaviours and self-assurance and confidence among young people.
   Family-based interventions also showed a potential to improve
   relationships between young people and their caregivers. Future studies
   should explore how to further strengthen school- and family-based
   interventions that promote mental health among young people.},

Title = {Barriers and Facilitators of Seeking Help for Mental Health Challenges
   Among Adolescents Across 13 Countries: A Qualitative Investigation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT HEALTH},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {77},
Number = {3},
Pages = {421-427},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Purpose: Adolescence is a period of developmental transition marked by a
   high prevalence of mental health challenges. The emergence of these
   challenges underscores the importance of encouraging help-seeking
   behaviors among adolescents to mitigate negative psychological outcomes.
   Gaining a deeper understanding of the lived experiences of adolescents
   can inform intervention development and increase access to care.
   Methods: This study draws on qualitative information collected from 71
   focus group discussions across 13 countries with male and female
   adolescents aged 12-19 years old. Focus group discussions were
   transcribed verbatim and translated into English, with transcripts coded
   and analyzed for emergent themes. Focused data analysis centered on
   themes related to help-seeking strategies for mental health challenges
   as well as related barriers and facilitators. Results: Participants
   emphasized the critical role of informal support systems, including
   friends and family, in helping adolescents cope with mental health
   challenges. Additionally, participants highlighted the importance of
   accessing professional support through school or community mental health
   services. Significant barriers to help-seeking were described, including
   mental health stigma, restrictive gender norms, limited service
   availability, poor quality or unaffordable services, low mental health
   literacy, and unsupportive interpersonal relationships. Participants
   emphasized the role of digital technologies, school and community
   environments, and trustworthy relationships as facilitators of seeking
   help. Discussion: While many adolescents are aware of the importance of
   seeking help for mental health challenges, there is a need for
   country-level interventions to increase mental health literacy and
   reduce mental health stigma in order to ensure optimal access to care.

Abstract = {Despite the global rise in child mental health difficulties, public
   understanding of young children's mental health remains unclear. Parents
   play a pivotal role in supporting their children's mental health and
   seeking professional help for concerns. Our mixed-methods systematic
   review sought to describe current levels of child mental health literacy
   (CMHL) among parents, examine variations across sociodemographic and
   clinical factors, and explore the relationship between CMHL and
   professional help-seeking. We searched six databases for
   English-language studies investigating any aspect of CMHL among parents
   of children aged 4-12 years in community settings, published in the last
   decade. From 26 studies across 12 countries (N = 5562), we found that
   parents generally had: (1) low to moderately low recognition, (2)
   diverse causal and other mental health beliefs (in Western and
   non-Western countries), (3) high levels of stigmatising beliefs and
   perceived stigma; (4) attitudes to professional help-seeking ranging
   from moderately positive to highly negative, and (5) low awareness of
   available help. Lower CMHL was associated with lower parental education
   level, being a father and less acculturated ethnic minorities, while
   higher CMHL was linked with previous service use. Help-seekers tended to
   have higher CMHL than non-help-seekers. Thus, disparities in parental
   CMHL may contribute to unequal access to mental health services. A more
   holistic, strengths-based and prevention-focused approach to CMHL in
   future research and measurement would inform intervention. Public health
   campaigns and targeted coproduced interventions to enhance the CMHL
   levels of parents with young children should form a key strategy for the
   promotion of child wellbeing.},

Journal = {ASIA-PACIFIC PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background Mental health problems in Malaysia are on a rise. This study
   aimed at performing a systematic review of mental health literacy (MHL)
   in Malaysia.
   Methods Medline, Embase, ERIC/Proquest, ScienceDirect, Pubmed, PsycINFO,
   CINAHL, Scopus, EBM Reviews - Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
   Trials, Ovid Emcare and reference lists of included studies were
   searched in February 2020. Studies that evaluated at least one of the
   main components of MHL, including (1) knowledge related to mental health
   issues, and (2) stigma, were included irrespective of study design. As
   secondary findings, the review also synthesized results related to
   facilitators and barriers to seeking mental health services. Depending
   on the research design, the quality of each study was assessed through
   checklists.
   Results Forty six studies published between 1995 to 2019 were included.
   Most studies used cross-sectional designs to investigate MHL. Findings
   indicate that most Malaysians have stigmatizing attitudes towards mental
   health problems. Participants in the included studies endorsed
   multifactorial explanations of mental health issues with a dominance of
   supernatural and religious aetiologies. Likewise, the commonest barrier
   was considering sources other than professional sources of mental-health
   services. Presence of adequate knowledge and considering providers as
   competent facilitated help-seeking. Additionally, there was considerable
   heterogeneity in studies and a lack of standardized measures assessing
   MHL.
   Conclusions There is an increase in studies on MHL in Malaysia. A few of
   these studies, based on experimental design, have shown positive
   effects. Researchers, practitioners, and policymakers should develop
   standardized measures and interventional studies based on all the
   components of MHL.},

Abstract = {Objectives: This paper compares the Cunningham Dax Collection with
   other, similar collections around the world, of art by people with an
   experience of mental illness.
   Conclusion: The Cunningham Dax Collection is one of the largest
   collections of art by people with an experience of mental illness and
   psychological trauma in the world. Unlike most other collections, which
   focus on artworks by people with psychosis, mania and depression, the
   Cunningham Dax Collection covers a broad range of experiences, including
   anxiety disorders, dementia, autism and psychological trauma, as well as
   works by children made during their treatment for emotional problems.
   While most other collections emphasize the artistic qualities of the
   works, the Cunningham Dax Collection emphasizes both their artistic and
   psychological dimensions. Its educational program is recognized for its
   approach against stigma, by simultaneously promoting mental health
   literacy and highlighting the creativity of people with mental illness
   through art. It also distinguishes itself from others by its assertive
   touring program to rural and regional centres, and internationally. This
   program aims to build capacity for mental health promotion and suicide
   prevention by encouraging local communities to come together and use the
   visiting exhibitions to launch local mental health awareness activities.},

Title = {Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Psychiatryand Psychology
   Education: Scoping Review},
Journal = {JMIR MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {11},
Abstract = {Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into
   health care, including psychiatry and psychology. In educational
   contexts, AI offers new possibilities for enhancing clinical reasoning,
   personalizing content delivery, and supporting professional development.
   Despite this emerging interest, a comprehensive understanding of how AI
   is currently used in mental health education, and the challenges
   associated with its adoption, remains limited. Objective: This scoping
   review aimed to identify and characterize current applications of AI in
   the teaching and learning of psychiatry and psychology. It also sought
   to document reported facilitators of and barriers to the integration of
   AI within educational contexts. Methods: A systematic search was
   conducted across 6 electronic databases (MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase,
   PsycINFO, EBM Reviews, and Google Scholar) from inception to October
   2024. The review followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
   Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR)
   guidelines. Studies were included if they focused on psychiatry or
   psychology, described the use of an AI tool, and discussed at least 1
   facilitator of or barrier to its use in education. Data were extracted
   on study characteristics, population, AI application, educational
   outcomes, facilitators, and barriers. Study quality was appraised using
   several design-appropriate tools. Results: From 6219 records, 10 (0.2\%)
   studies met the inclusion criteria. Eight categories of AI applications
   were identified: clinical decision support, educational content
   creation, therapeutic toolsand mental health monitoring, administrative
   and research assistance, natural language processing (NLP),
   program/policy development, students' study aid, and professional
   development. Key facilitators included the availability of AI tools,
   positive learner attitudes, digital infrastructure, and time-saving
   features. Barriers included limited AI training, ethical concerns, lack
   of digital literacy, algorithmic opacity, and insufficient curricular
   integration. The overall methodological quality of included studieswas
   moderate to high. Conclusions:AI is being used across a range of
   educational functions in psychiatry and psychology, from clinical
   training to assessment and administrative support. Although the
   potential for enhancing learning outcomes is clear, its successful
   integration requires addressing ethical, technical, and pedagogical
   barriers. Future efforts should focus on AI literacy, faculty
   development, and institutional policies to guide responsible and
   effective use. This review underscores the importance of
   interdisciplinary collaboration to ensure the safe, equitable, and
   meaningful adoption of AI in mental health education.},

Title = {Bridging the Gap: A Pilot Study of a Lay Health Worker Model to Decrease
   Child Mental Health Stigma and Promote Parents' Professional
   Help-Seeking for Black/African American Children},
Journal = {PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {20},

Pages = {64-77},
Abstract = {Unmet mental health needs among children in the United States (U.S.) are
   at a critical status (Kimball \& Miller, 2015; Perou et at., 2013), with
   less than half of children receiving needed care (Whitney \& Peterson,
   2019). Unmet mental health needs are especially pronounced for
   racial/ethnic minority children, including Black/African American
   children (Alegria et al.. 2010; Cokley et al., 2014), whose rates of
   suicide among those aged 5-11 years has increased in the past two
   decades (Bridge et al., 2015). Culturally responsive strategies that
   build on common mental health help-seeking pathways for Black/African
   American families are needed to improve access to care. The Bridging the
   Gap pilot project described in this paper used an innovative lay health
   worker model embedded in faith-based networks to target child mental
   health stigma and promote professional help-seeking among 65
   Black/African American parents of children 5-12 years old. A
   single-group, pretest, posttest, follow-up (PPF) design (with double
   pretest and double follow-up) was used to structure the delivery of the
   pilot program and data collection. Child mental health stigma
   significantly decreased after the intervention portion of the program
   but help-seeking attitudes stayed constant. Thirteen parents had
   children with clinically significant mental health needs. Of the eight
   parents reached for follow-up, five sought child mental health services
   based on individualized recommendations and the rest endorsed intentions
   to follow through on service recommendations. Parents endorsed
   satisfaction with the program and several program evaluation themes were
   identified through qualitative data. Recommendations and future
   directions are discussed.},

Title = {Exploring the perspectives of young adults on mental healthcare and

   qualitative study},
Journal = {BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {25},

Month = {OCT 22},
Abstract = {Background Young people often face significant challenges accessing
   effective mental health support as they navigate through complex
   healthcare systems, education pathways, and social pressures.
   Understanding the service-level barriers they encounter is critical to
   improving mental health system design and delivery. While previous
   studies have examined individual barriers to mental healthcare access,
   few have adopted a cross-sectorial, youth-informed approach which
   captures the interrelated structural, institutional, and socio-cultural
   factors influencing young people's mental health experiences. Methods
   Seventeen participants aged 18-24 years with lived experience of
   depression and/or anxiety participated in nine in-person focus groups
   and interviews in Perth. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to
   identify systemic barriers and facilitators to mental healthcare, with a
   particular focus on access, care coordination, therapeutic engagement,
   and service responsiveness. Results Key themes included fragmented care
   pathways, inadequate provider follow-up, prolonged wait times, financial
   constraints, lack of youth-specific mental health training among
   clinicians, and limited therapeutic rapport. Participants also described
   inadequate mental health literacy within schools and persistent stigma
   in social and familial settings. These intersecting barriers hindered
   access, disrupted continuity of care, and undermined trust in the mental
   health system. Conclusions Findings highlight critical inefficiencies in
   mental health service delivery for young Australians. Policy responses
   should prioritise integrated care models, investment in
   multidisciplinary youth mental health hubs, improved school-based mental
   health literacy, and culturally inclusive anti-stigma initiatives to
   promote access, trust, and continuity of care.},

Abstract = {Adolescent suicide rates in Australia have fallen significantly during
   recent years. The incidence, however, clearly remains a serious concern
   for young people, parents, professionals and policy makers. Some groups
   of Australian youth appear to be at heightened risk. Adolescents within
   the welfare system, indigenous, rural and refugee youth, along with same
   sex attracted young people often need very careful monitoring and
   support. Young men continue to take their lives more frequently than
   young women. Prevention programmes in Australia aim to develop
   resilience in young people, families and communities that can serve as
   protection against self harm and suicide. The improvement of mental
   health literacy, a fostering of adolescent self-efficacy and better
   access to early intervention strategies are currently privileged in
   national and state policies related to young people in Australia. More
   work is needed, however, to achieve a well integrated mental health
   framework capable of effectively addressing adolescent suicide
   prevention into the twenty-first century.},

Title = {Death Anxiety and Interment Stress Family Interventions for Filipino

Journal = {OMEGA-JOURNAL OF DEATH AND DYING},

Month = {2022 OCT 7},
Abstract = {The overall intent of this research is to determine the preferred death
   anxiety and interment stress family interventions for Filipino older
   adults. 214 Filipino respondents (18-75 years old) participated in this
   conjoint analysis study. Results showed that cognitive state (23.272\%)
   is most important and spiritual state (17.256\%) as least important
   family intervention. Part-worth of the attributes shows medical routines
   and procedures (.342) as most preferred for physical state; mental
   health awareness (.266) for cognitive state; livelihood trainings (.051)
   for social state; family therapy (.022) for psychological state; and
   church activities (.017) for spiritual state. Spiritual state, age, and
   number of children have marked associations. Respondents aged 60-75 with
   a higher number of children in the family, cope with death anxiety and
   interment stress through spirituality. Significant findings of this
   study will greatly contribute to the knowledge base of geriatric mental
   health care; including caregivers and family members of older adults.},

Abstract = {Public stigma towards psychosis constitutes a major obstacle hindering
   the provision of evidence-based psychotherapy. Such attitudes appear
   particularly concerning in South-East Asia, where people with complex
   mental health needs avoid seeking professional help due to high levels
   of stigmatization and discrimination. This study investigated the
   effects of a brief digitalized psychoeducational intervention on
   reduction of stigma associated with psychosis among young adults in
   Singapore. 157 participants were recruited and completed a single-arm
   efficacy trial. Pre- and post-intervention levels of stigma were
   assessed with standardized measures. Significant reduction across
   cognitive, attitudinal, and behavioural dimensions of stigma was
   achieved post-intervention. Comparing with prior studies reporting
   elaborate and resource-intensive public mental health education
   initiatives, our results suggest that similar, if not greater, outcomes
   might be achieved via single-session electronically delivered
   interventions, particularly among younger sections of Asian societies.},

Abstract = {This study aims to analyze the effect of psychological health based on
   artificial intelligence agent technology on the implementation effect of
   Japanese family education. By combining mobile agent technology and
   education thought, the system structure and working mechanism of the
   education support system of agents are studied to build personalized
   support for the family education system based on mobile agents. A total
   of 320 Japanese middle school students were randomly divided into an
   experimental group and a control group, with 160 cases in each group.
   The control group received traditional family health education, while
   the experimental group received mental health education based on the
   Agent Technology family education system. The basic information and
   mental health scores of the two groups of students were compared. The
   results showed that there were no remarkable differences in the number
   of male and female cases, weight, height, average age, grade, home
   address, or family situation between groups (p > 0.05). The
   psychological health level of the experimental group was considerably
   superior to that of the control group regarding obsessional symptoms,
   interpersonal tension and sensitivity, depression, anxiety, learning
   pressure, maladaptation, emotional imbalance, and psychological
   imbalance (p < 0.05). In summary, compared with traditional family
   education, family education of the mental health education system based
   on agent technology can better improve the level of middle school
   students' mental health, which can improve student forced symptoms,
   interpersonal tension and sensitivity, depression, anxiety, learning
   pressure, maladjustment, emotional imbalance, psychological imbalance,
   and many other psychological states. Furthermore, personalized support
   for family education systems based on mobile agents has the advantages
   of autonomy, responsiveness, initiative, and mobility, which provides a
   new idea for family education.},

   destigmatizing mental health conditions, (b) shifting client
   expectations as ``therapy consumers{''} shaped by online interactions,
   and (c) the challenges of misinformation as therapists navigate clients'
   self-diagnosis and misdiagnosis. The study concludes with
   recommendations for integrating digital literacy, critical thinking, and

Abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disability
   affecting 1 in 44 children nationally. Timely referral to intervention
   and support services for ASD has consistently demonstrated significant
   long-term positive effects on symptoms and subsequent skills and family
   outcomes. This paper highlights a novel and innovative approach of
   short-term consultations for best practices to ultimately increase
   access to timely ASD evaluations and support through a state-wide school
   telehealth initiative. The goal of the initiative was to facilitate
   rapid access to ASD evaluation and support (within 2 weeks of referral
   in school-age youth) among under-resourced school systems in Central
   Texas. First, this paper provides background relative to current
   disparities that many children face when attempting to obtain ASD
   evaluations and support. Second, a statewide legislative response is
   described that created a mental health consortium targeting increased
   access to broad-based mental health services and supports, particularly
   in underserved areas. Next, the Texas Child Health Access Through
   Telemedicine (TCHATT) program is outlined with a particular focus on
   day-to-day operationality and concentrated efforts to increase mental
   health literacy among school teams relative to ASD symptoms and
   co-occurring behavioral health concerns. Year 1 utilization data metrics
   (September 2020-May 2021) and representative case examples are
   presented. Finally, early ``lessons learned{''} and future directions
   are discussed.},

Abstract = {The prevalence of mental disorders is so high that members of the public
   will frequently have contact with someone experiencing a disorder. How
   they respond to that person may affect help-seeking and outcome of the
   disorder. However, community surveys show that many members of the
   public lack knowledge and skills in this area. To overcome this lack, a
   mental health first aid training course has been developed in Australia
   and widely disseminated. It has also been adapted for different national
   and cultural groups. A number of trials have been carried out to
   evaluate the course, showing improvements in recognition of mental
   disorders, concordance with professionals about treatments, confidence
   in providing first aid, actual help provided to others, and reduction in
   stigmatizing attitudes. The course is continually being extended and
   improved. Work is currently underway to develop a version for supporters
   of adolescents, and to develop best practice standards for first aid,
   both for developing disorders and in crisis situations.},

Year = {2023},
Volume = {2},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Bipolar disorder (BD) in youth often goes unrecognized and therefore
   untreated. However, little is known about pathways to treatment of youth
   with BD and factors that influence the time taken for each stage of
   these pathways. In this article, we use the conceptual framework by
   Scott and colleagues called the Model of Pathways to Treatment as a
   foundation to explore the components of delay in the diagnosis and
   treatment of youth with BD. The total time from the onset of symptoms
   until treatment initiation was divided into four sequential intervals;
   i.e., the Appraisal, the Help-seeking, the Diagnostic and the
   Pre-treatment intervals and potential disease, patient, and healthcare
   system/provider factors that influence each interval were identified.
   This multidimensional conceptual framework can offer a systematic
   approach to understanding and exploring barriers to early identification
   and interventions in BD, which is a crucial step in the development of
   strategies to facilitate prompt diagnosis and treatment. We hope this
   work contributes to the discussion on delayed diagnosis and treatment of
   youth with BD and provides a roadmap to inform future research studies
   and policy decisions.},

Abstract = {Behavioral family interventions are an effective way to intervene to
   prevent negative developmental outcomes for adolescents. Participation
   in family interventions encompasses behavioral and cognitive/attitudinal
   dimensions, among others, indicated by retention and engagement,
   respectively. Two dimensions of participation, retention and engagement,
   in a family intervention were examined in a sample of newly homeless
   adolescents and their parents or guardians. Correlates of participation
   included parents with more income and less perceived family conflict and
   adolescents with higher endorsement of depression, anxiety,
   somatization, obsessive-compulsive, phobic, and psychotic symptoms on
   the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). Stronger therapeutic alliance was
   correlated with being more distressed (i.e., lower income, more
   hostility), being a female adolescent participant, and having greater
   comfort discussing sex with parents. Furthermore, parents and
   adolescents with greater distress and thus greater need were more apt to
   finish the intervention. The finding that families who were experiencing
   more distress had higher alliance scores suggests that there is an
   additional need for development of interventions for families in crisis.
   Both participant and provider perceptions are also important in
   development of a strong therapeutic alliance. This study's findings have
   implications for further exploration of the development of cultural
   humility and improving mental health literacy among facilitators of
   behavioral interventions.},

Abstract = {All around the world, partnerships among schools and other youth-serving
   systems are promoting more comprehensive school-based mental health
   services. This article describes the development of international
   networks for school mental health (SMH) including the International
   Alliance for Child and Adolescent Mental Health and Schools (INTERCAMHS)
   and the more recent School Mental Health International Leadership
   Exchange (SMHILE). In conjunction with World Conferences on Mental
   Health Promotion, SMHILE has held pre-conference and planning meetings
   and has identified five critical themes for the advancement of global
   SMH: 1) Cross-sector collaboration in building systems of care; 2)
   meaningful youth and family engagement; 3) workforce development and
   mental health literacy; 4) implementation of evidence-based practices;
   and 5) ongoing monitoring and quality assurance. In this article we
   provide general background on SMH in four nations, two showing strong
   progress (the United States and Canada), one showing moderate progress
   (Norway), and one beginning the work (Liberia). Following general
   background for each country, actions in relation to the SMHILE themes
   are reviewed. The article concludes with plans and ideas for future
   global collaboration towards advancement of the SMH field.},

Title = {CHATogether: a novel digital program to promote Asian American

Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},

Abstract = {Background In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated rise
   in anti-Asian hate crimes, we developed the Compassionate Home, Action
   Together program, (CHATogether) to support the mental health of the
   Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community. CHATogether is a
   culturally informed and virtually delivered support program that
   harnesses the talents of AAPI teens, young adults, parents, and mental
   health professionals who share a commitment to serve their local
   communities. Methods Our objective was to identify the active
   components, optimal utilization, potential benefits, and pertinent
   limitations of the CHATogether program during the 3 years since its
   inception in 2019. By that time, the program had developed six distinct
   component arms: interactive theater, mental health education, research,
   peer support and community outreach, collaboration, and AAPI mentorship.
   To work towards this objective, we conducted a qualitative study using
   thematic analysis and an inductive approach based on grounded theory
   (GT), in which we analyzed anonymized transcripts of four focus groups,
   comprised of 20 program participants (11 females; 9 males). Results We
   developed a model of two overarching domains, each with three underlying
   themes: I. Individual stressors: (1) Family conflict; (2) Cultural
   identity; and (3) Pandemic impact; and II. Collective stressors: (1)
   Stigma related to mental health and illness; (2) Pandemic uncertainty;
   and (3) Xenophobia and societal polarization. Strengths of the
   CHATogether program include its role as a conduit toward AAPI
   connectedness and pride as well as purpose in building community.
   Through support and mentorship, the program cultivates a unique platform
   that promotes healing and resiliency in response to pandemic stressors
   and beyond. Conclusions CHATogether creates a safe space for the AAPI
   community. Through its methods of storytelling and encouraging
   creativity, CHATogether facilitates the discussion of challenging topics
   specific to the AAPI community. Given the national mental health crisis
   that is further being exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, a digital
   prevention program such as CHATogether holds promise towards providing
   access to mental health resources and supporting early help-seeking
   behaviors for individuals in the AAPI community.},

Abstract = {Background: Despite the high prevalence of mental health disorders
   worldwide, a significant proportion of distressed individuals do not
   seek professional help. Digital technology can be a potential bridge to
   reduce the treatment gap for mental disorders. A systematic review was
   undertaken to examine the technology-based interventions aimed at
   improving help-seeking attitude, intention, or behavior for mental
   health concerns. Methods: The literature search was conducted in
   January-February 2020 through various e-databases using relevant
   keywords that targeted help-seeking interventions for mental health
   disorders via different technology modes. Results: 21 studies (15
   randomized controlled trials and six non-randomized studies) were
   reviewed. The included studies were published between April 2006 to
   February 2020. Majority of the interventions led to an increase in the
   help-seeking variables. The crucial role of online delivery, participant
   involvement, and embedded links to professional services in encouraging
   help-seeking is highlighted. The review emphasizes the need for
   understanding utility of multicomponent interventions with personalized
   elements targeting help-seeking behavior, particularly in
   low-middle-income countries, and studies involving longer duration
   follow-ups. Conclusion: This systematic review is the first of its kind
   to examine technology-based interventions to improve help-seeking for
   mental health and suggests that such interventions play a crucial role
   in positively impacting help-seeking. The complex interplay between the
   relevant variables such as mental health literacy, stigma, help-seeking
   attitude, intention and behavior, and the intervention components that
   may have a differential bearing on these variables are issues that merit
   urgent attention in further research.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Parents do not always seek timely help for adolescents when the
   need arises. Although interventions to increase parental help-seeking
   have been evaluated and published, no systematic review of these
   interventions has been conducted. The aim of this systematic review is
   to collate, synthesise, and evaluate research on help-seeking
   interventions for parents of adolescents. Methods: Six electronic
   databases were searched from inception to May 2020 using terms related
   to the concepts of ``parent{''} and ``help-seeking{''} and focusing on
   parents of adolescents (aged 10-19 years). Methodological quality was
   assessed using the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies; the
   Behavioural Change Taxonomy was used to code behavioral change
   techniques, and ``promising interventions{''} were identified using
   pre-established criteria. Results: Eighteen studies met inclusion
   criteria, with six rated strong for design and methodology. The most
   frequently identified Behavioural Change Taxonomies included a credible
   source delivering the intervention, supporting parents, and providing
   prompts/cues regarding services/ appointments. Four interventions were
   identified as ``promising{''} because of strong methodology, significant
   positive outcomes, and strong evidence-base. Conclusions: More
   high-quality, theory-driven parental help-seeking interventions using
   common outcome measures are needed to advance the literature in this
   area. Future research should replicate the promising interventions
   identified to develop best practice guidelines. (c) 2021 Society for

Journal = {LANCET REGIONAL HEALTH-WESTERN PACIFIC},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background: Secondary schools have attempted to address gaps in
   help-seeking for mental health problems with little success. This trial
   evaluated the effectiveness of a universal web-based service (Smooth
   Sailing) for improving help-seeking intentions for mental health
   problems and other related outcomes among students.
   Methods: A cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted to evaluate
   the 12-week outcomes of the Smooth Sailing service among 1841 students
   from 22 secondary schools in New South Wales, Australia. Assignment was
   conducted at the school level. The control condition received
   school-as-usual. The primary outcome was help-seeking intentions for
   general mental health problems at 12-weeks post-baseline. Secondary
   outcomes included help-seeking behaviour, anxiety and depressive
   symptoms, psychological distress, psychological barriers to
   help-seeking, and mental health literacy. Data were analysed using mixed
   linear models. This trial was registered with the Australian and New
   Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12618001539224).
   Findings: At 12-weeks post-baseline, there was a marginal statistical
   difference in the relative means of help-seeking intentions (effect
   size=0.10, 95\%CI: -0.02-0.21) that favoured the intervention condition.
   Help-seeking from adults declined in both conditions. There was a
   greater reduction in the number of students who ``needed support for
   their mental health but were not seeking help{''} in the intervention
   condition (OR: 2.08, 95\%CI: 1.72-2.27, P<.0001). No other universal
   effects were found. Participants found the service easy to use and
   understand; However, low motivation, time, forgetfulness, and lack of
   perceived need were barriers to use.
   Interpretation: Smooth Sailing led to small improvements in help-seeking
   intentions. Refinements are needed to improve its effectiveness on other
   mental health outcomes and to increase student uptake and engagement.

   from 2000 to 2023, and analyzes and evaluates the selected policy texts
   through the PMC index model.Results The study indicates growing national
   attention towards adolescent mental health policies in terms of both
   quantity and quality, with improved policy feasibility and synergy.
   However, shortcomings exist in the policy formulation process, including
   a lack of advocacy and supervision-oriented policies, a focus on short
   to medium-term effects, and inadequate comprehensive planning, hindering
   their swift implementation.Discussion In conclusion, facing the
   escalating crisis of adolescent mental health, the previous requirements
   of the education system are no longer sufficient. The government needs
   to further improve the top-down policy system, weave a safety net for
   mental health education and preventive intervention, and effectively
   promote the development of adolescent mental health.},

Abstract = {BackgroundIn the context of Greece, many instruments measuring
   constructs pertinent to child and adolescent mental health lacked a
   locally-validated, freely-available version. As part of a nationwide
   survey, we translated and cross-culturally adapted a collection of
   seventeen brief, largely-employed assessment tools that can be used at
   scale.MethodsThis study is part of the Child and Adolescent Mental
   Health Initiative in Greece (CAMHI), a capacity-building program
   focusing on enhancing mental health care for children and adolescents
   living in Greece. We conducted a nationwide survey assessing mental
   health symptoms, parenting practices, service availability and quality,
   mental health literacy and stigma, and professional practices within the
   country. As part of this process, we selected outcomes and instruments
   after consulting the International Consortium for Health Outcomes
   Measurement (ICHOM) and the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection
   of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN). From our selection, we
   identified 17 instruments that did not have a Greek-validated version
   available for use. These instruments were translated and
   cross-culturally adapted following a structured procedure, including
   independent back-and-forth translations, synthesis of versions, expert
   revision, and pilot testing. Some instruments were slightly modified to
   meet CAMHI survey purposes.ResultsA cross-culturally adapted version in
   Greek was made available for the following instruments: Pediatric
   Symptoms Checklist (PSC); Deliberate Self Harm Inventory (DSH)
   (modified); Child and Adolescent Trauma Screen-2 (CATS-2); ABCD Screen
   Use (modified); Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham-IV (SNAP-IV); Parent Behavior
   Inventory (PBI); Mental Health Literacy Scale (MHLS)-(modified);
   Australian Mental Health Vignettes; Reported and Intended Behavior Scale
   (RIBS); Barriers to Access to Care (BACE) (modified); Experience of
   Service Questionnaire (ESQ) (modified); and Multitheoretical List of
   Therapeutic Interventions (MULTI-30) (modified).ConclusionA collection
   of these widely-used assessment tools is now adapted for the local
   context and freely accessible at {[}https://osf.io/crz6h/]. Researchers
   and health professionals in Greece can utilize this resource to screen,
   evaluate, and monitor various constructs related to mental health in
   accordance with the most effective practices.},

   Aspirations for Participation Across Five Low- and Middle-Income

Abstract = {Purpose: Effective intervention, policy, and research inmental health
   andwell-being (MHWB) require young people to be understood not only as
   beneficiaries, but also as active agents in codesigning and implementing
   initiatives. To identify pathways for young people's participation in
   promoting MHWB in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), this study
   surveyed young people's aspirations for engagement, their spheres of
   influence, capacity building needs, and key barriers to participation.
   Methods: Using U-Report, United Nations Children's Emergency Fund's
   socialmessaging tool and data collection platform, we distributed a
   short quantitative survey to a nonrepresentative, but large sample of
   young people aged 15e29 across five LMICs: Nigeria, Brazil, Jamaica,
   South Africa, and Burundi.
   Results: A total of 42,689 young people responded, with representation
   from most or all provinces within each country. Participants' average
   age was 23.8 years (SD = 3.77). Young people's core aspirations were to
   join a mental health awareness project and to support their peers.
   Participants considered schools and community settings to be the most
   important spheres for engagement. Lack of information about mental
   health was the main perceived barrier to participation, and mental
   health classes the main training need.
   Discussion: In many countries, MHWB is not taught or discussed in
   schools and youth-led mental health interventions are rare. Findings
   from this study reveal clear aspirations for participatory engagement to
   promoteMHWBamong young people in LMICs. To support meaningful
   participation, policymakers and youth service providers must ensure that
   young people have access to mental health literacy training and
   opportunities to raise awareness in schools or community settings.},

Abstract = {The mental health of youth with chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been
   increasingly recognized as an area of clinical need. The development of
   mental health concerns is influenced by a range of physiological,
   psychological, and environmental factors. Some of these factors are
   common across child development, but some are more unique to youth with
   CKD. Mental health concerns are associated with increased risk for a
   range of poor medical outcomes (e.g., adherence, risk of transplant
   rejection) and quality of life concerns. In this educational review, we
   discuss the current evidence base regarding the development of mental
   health concerns in youth with CKD. The review covers multiple domains
   including mood and anxiety disorders, traumatic stress, and
   neurodevelopmental disorders. Estimated prevalence and hypothesized risk
   factors are outlined, and the potential impact of mental health on
   medical care and functional outcomes are reviewed. Finally, we introduce
   options for intervention to support positive mental health and offer
   recommendations for building access to mental health care and improving
   the mental health education/training of medical professionals.Graphical

Journal = {ENTERTAINMENT COMPUTING},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Go plays a very prominent role in quality education and mental health
   education. Go can cultivate character, make friends, improve
   interpersonal relationships, and promote mental health. To apply it to
   mental health and emotional regulation, the AlphaGo series algorithms
   are analyzed. To address the unstable deep reinforcement learning
   training, low training data utilization, model sensitivity to
   hyper-parameters, and heavy parameter tuning burden, the algorithm is
   optimized by combining ensemble learning and advanced deep reinforcement
   learning. Then, the weighted voting method is applied to the selection
   step of sub nodes in the Monte Carlo tree search process. At the same
   time, asynchronous parallelization improvements are implemented to
   improve the efficiency of the Monte Carlo tree search algorithm.
   Finally, a board game based on ensemble learning and improved Monte
   Carlo tree search algorithm is obtained. Through experimental analysis,
   the average winning rate of the system was 93.36 \%. The number of users
   who were very satisfied with the game was 83.96 \%. After intervention,
   the depression and anxiety scores of the experimental group students
   were significantly lower than the control group (P < 0.05). The designed
   game can effectively alleviate user anxiety and depression, providing
   new ideas for the psychotherapy.},

Abstract = {Objective: This study evaluated a consumer delivered anti-stigma
   presentation, In Our Own Voice (IOOV), with Masters of Social Work (MSW)
   students, replicating a previous study with undergraduates. Methods:
   Thirty MSW students completed pre and post surveys to measure changes in
   attitude, knowledge and social distance after the presentation. Results:
   Paired samples t-tests showed increases in attitude (p < .001),
   knowledge (p < .05), and social distance (p < .001). Compared with
   previous research on undergraduate students, MSW students scored higher
   on all three pre-test measures (all p < .001). Conclusions: The results
   further support the effectiveness of IOOV and indicate that graduate
   level helping professionals can benefit from anti-stigma programs.
   Future research should go beyond self-report knowledge and attitude
   evaluation, test the efficacy of the components of the IOOV program
   (video, contact with presenters), and test the lasting effects of the
   program.},

Title = {Health-care undergraduate student's attitudes towards mental illness
   following anti-stigma education: a critical review of the literature},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH TRAINING EDUCATION AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {18},

Abstract = {Purpose There has been growing awareness underpinned with legislative
   recognition of the need to reduce the stigma attached to mental health.
   Education is seen as an integral factor for this endeavour. The purpose
   of this paper is to review existing literature to determine both
   positive and negative attitudinal changes of health-care-related
   undergraduate students towards mental illness after a training
   intervention within higher education. Design/methodology/approach A
   search of papers written in the English Language was conducted between
   2004 and 2021, using CINAHL, Eric, Educational Research Complete,
   Medline, psychINFO and SocIndex. Search terms used were undergraduate,
   attitudes or perceptions, mental illness/mental ill health, education,
   stigma and students. Findings In total, 24 studies were critically
   reviewed, which included experimental, descriptive and exploratory
   designs. The appraisal of papers used recognised evaluation tools to
   review the methodological quality. Findings suggest that overall,
   anti-stigma education has a significant positive effect for student
   attitudinal change. Research limitations/implications Mental health
   anti-stigma education is beneficial for changing attitudes, however,
   more bio-medically framed training is less powerful for initiating
   change. Learning from those with the lived experience appears to have a
   more sustainable impact as indicated in some of the studies. There is a
   need for more exploratory research to gain further knowledge on the
   critical educational mechanisms that may foster more long-term reframing
   of positive attitudes towards mental health. Practical implications
   Training providers need to consider the compelling evidence base
   surrounding anti-stigma pedagogy that supports the use of individuals
   with experience of mental ill health within the educational processes.
   Social implications Mental health stigma has potential for profound
   negative impact on individuals and at a wider societal level. Education
   is central to enable learners to consider their attitudes to mental
   illness to reduce stigmatising attitudes. Students on
   health-care-related courses are influential in becoming catalysts for
   change. Originality/value This paper has critically reviewed the
   literature examining the attitudes of health-care-related undergraduate
   students following anti-stigma education, offering insights into some of
   positive and negative attitudinal changes and opinions of the event. In
   particular contributing to an understanding on the important components
   for eradicating the stigma surrounding mental health.},

Title = {A Systematic Review of Help-Seeking Barriers for Racial-Ethnic Minority
   Caregivers Accessing Autism Diagnostic and Intervention Services},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RACIAL AND ETHNIC HEALTH DISPARITIES},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 AUG 5},
Abstract = {Caregivers play an essential role in early help-seeking and intervention
   for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Caregivers, therefore,
   provide a crucial role in helping to address the racial and ethnic
   disparity identified in accessing ASD intervention and diagnostic
   services (Bejarano-Mart \& iacute;n et al., Journal of Autism and
   Developmental Disorders 50(9), 3380-3394, 2020). Unfortunately,
   racial-ethnic minority caregivers of children with autism (CCA) are less
   likely to contact a physician or healthcare professionals about their
   concerns and more likely to delay their contact to have their child
   evaluated (Zeleke et al., Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders
   49(10), 4320-4331, 2019). However, little evidence exists to explain why
   such a gap exists in the help-seeking behaviors between White and
   racial-ethnic minority CCA. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted
   a systematic literature review to identify articles that have studied
   barriers in help-seeking for racial-ethnic minority CCA. A broad
   literature search across four databases was conducted (i.e., PubMed,
   PsycINFO, Education Resources Information Center, and Child Development
   and Adolescent Studies). The coding team identified 17 articles on
   help-seeking barriers for racial-ethnic minority CCA. A thematic
   analysis was used to narratively synthesize the help-seeking barriers
   identified across these 17 studies. Four themes emerged from our
   findings: logistical barriers, provider competence, ASD literacy, and
   cultural stigma. We also provided clinical recommendations for
   healthcare providers working with families with racial-ethnic minority
   CCA.},

Title = {Embedding lived experience expertise across the mental health tertiary
   education sector: An integrative review in the context of Aotearoa New
   Zealand},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC AND MENTAL HEALTH NURSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1140-1152},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Accessible Summary
   What is known on the subject?
   An important step towards improving mental health outcomes is the
   realignment of tertiary mental health education and research in a way
   which places strategic value on experience-driven involvement in mental
   health and addiction-related care.
   One of the most widely recognized ways of achieving this is by
   increasing representation of individuals with first-hand experience of
   mental health and addiction distress (also known or referred to as
   Experts by Experience or EBE) within the tertiary sector.
   What this paper adds to existing knowledge?
   Benefits of tertiary EBE representation such as improving student's
   preparedness for practice and the empowerment of mental health consumers
   are consistently reported throughout the literature. In striving towards
   these outcomes, it is crucial we remain mindful of relevant and
   often-reported hurdles such as stigma and improper implementation.
   By using Aotearoa New Zealand as a case study, the need for approaches
   to increasing EBE representation which is conscious of diverse cultural
   contexts, perspectives and identities is highlighted.
   What are the implications for practice?
   This review draws together a broad range of factors associated with
   improving clinical practice. These include the potential for EBE
   representation to improve outcomes for trainee clinicians, and the
   incorporation of consumer-driven perspectives into evidence-based
   practice.
   This review further highlights the need for EBE representation to be
   implemented in a way which is responsive to the cultural needs and
   nuances of mental health education and practice in Aotearoa New Zealand,
   and, similarly in other countries.
   Introduction
   There is potential value in increasing representation of expert by
   experience (EBE) involvement in mental health education sectors. This
   approach to improving mental health outcomes is here explored in the
   context of Aotearoa New Zealand's tertiary education sector.
   Aim/Question
   This review sought to identify potential outcomes, benefits and barriers
   associated with EBE representation in tertiary institutions, whilst
   critically analysing these strategies in the context of Aotearoa New
   Zealand's mental health education sector.
   Method
   Data retrieved from electronic databases were subjected to critical
   appraisal and thematic analysis. The integrative review drew from a
   final data set of 113 articles.
   Results
   An integrative review of our search results indicated that moving
   towards a tertiary mental health model in which lived experience plays a
   central role has the potential to benefit both teaching and research in
   the tertiary sector.
   Discussion
   The interplay between contemporary perspectives on tertiary EBE
   representation and the cultural needs and nuances of Aotearoa New
   Zealand's tertiary sector highlights the need for critical and careful
   approaches to EBE representation.
   Implications for clinical practice
   Findings surrounding tertiary EBE representation have direct
   implications for the training of mental health practitioners and the
   evaluation and development of clinical practice outcomes and procedures.},

Abstract = {Purpose - The issue of mental health amongst students in the senior
   years of secondary schooling is one which has recently gained traction
   in mainstream media and public discourse across Australia. The purpose
   of this paper is to uncover the ways in which schools and other
   education providers are responding to mental health issues amongst their
   students both proactively (for prevention) and reactively (for referral
   and treatment).
   Design/methodology/approach - The project took a qualitative research
   approach to gathering data from student support staff based in schools
   and out-of-school learning settings, through a focus group methodology.
   Findings - The project found that despite policy rhetoric and research
   evidence supporting pro-active, curriculum integrated, early
   intervention to prevent and avoid mental illness and mental distress
   amongst secondary school students, most schools still take a reactive,
   piecemeal approach to prevention of mental illness and provision of
   mental health care. Individual schools and learning providers are
   responding to issues in a variety of ways, along a continuum of care.
   Research limitations/implications - The project had a small sample size
   and restricted geographic area. The divergence in findings between staff
   from schools in this area and staff from other education providers
   suggests much more work needs to be done in establishing the
   implications of bureaucratic sector and school governance on health and
   wellbeing outcomes.
   Originality/value - This paper begins to explore an under-researched
   area of school and other education provider responses to rising concern
   about student mental health.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Objective: To explore the intervention effect of aerobic exercise in
   combination with acceptance and commitment therapy on mental health of
   adolescents during the outbreak of COVID-19 based on the theory of the
   dual-factor model of mental health. Methodology: 1200 adolescents aged
   12?19 in Fujian Province, China were screened by means of the
   dual-factor model of mental health from March to April 2020. 30
   vulnerable, 30 symptomatic but contented and 30 distressed adolescents
   were selected as the experiment objects, and these 3 types of
   adolescents were randomly divided into the intervention group and the
   control group. Among them, the intervention group received 8 weeks of
   aerobic exercise in combination with acceptance and commitment therapy,
   3 times a week, about 40?60 min each time. The control group, however,
   didn?t receive any intervention other than routine mental health
   education. Measurements were made before and after the intervention.
   Results: (1) For vulnerable, symptomatic but contented and distressed
   individuals, before the intervention, there is no significant difference
   between the intervention group and the control group in terms of
   psychological distress, well-being and psychological flexibility (P
   0.05), but there are no significant differences in the control group (P
   0.05). Conclusion: Attention should be paid to the problems of mental
   health of adolescents caused by the sudden outbreak of public health
   incidents. Aerobic exercise in combination with acceptance and
   commitment therapy is feasible and effective for the intervention in
   mental health of adolescents.},

Abstract = {Seeking help for mental health concerns is critical for improving
   wellbeing and preventing the development of mental health disorders, yet
   many adolescents with mental health problems fail to seek professional
   help. It is well established that young people with mental health
   problems face a variety of barriers to help-seeking; however, little is
   known about the ways in which these barriers interact to impact upon the
   help-seeking process. Guided by the reasoned action approach, this study
   investigated the predictive relationship between factors that influence
   help-seeking. Results revealed that mental health knowledge
   significantly predicted help-seeking intentions, while attitudes did
   not. Gender differences were identified for help source preferences. The
   current study contributes to knowledge on the relationship between key
   variables that influence the adolescent help-seeking process. Findings
   highlight the importance of mental health knowledge in predicting
   help-seeking intentions and provide support for interventions that focus
   on improving mental health literacy in adolescents.},

Abstract = {Purpose of Review The training of psychiatrists and other mental health
   professionals requires education on a range of interpersonal,
   communication, and psychotherapy techniques. Classroom and workshop
   training must be augmented by experiential learning with feedback for
   skill implementation with fidelity. Virtual standardized patients (VSPs)
   are computerized conversational agents that can support experiential
   learning through standardized, consequence-free training environments at
   reduced costs. Recent Findings Research on mental health VSPs is rife
   with feasibility and acceptability pilot studies across various training
   populations and settings. Users have generally reported positive
   reactions to training with VSPs, though frustrations with some VSP
   speech recognition or VSP response relevance has been reported. Several
   studies have demonstrated a promising transfer of clinical skills from
   VSP training to human standardized patients and randomized trials
   supporting improved skill relative to reading or academic study are
   encouraging. As technology improves and natural language processing and
   accurate computer response generation for broad ranging conversational
   topics emerges, the field would benefit from research on the
   characteristics of effective VSPs for a range of purposes and trainee
   populations. Well-designed randomized evaluations of VSPs relative to
   best practices in education are needed, particularly regarding the
   impact of VSPs on clinical practice among actual patients.},

Abstract = {Literature indicates a high prevalence and burden of mental illness in
   youths world-wide, which may be even higher in low- and middle-income
   countries (LMIC), such as South Africa and Zambia. Additionally, there
   is a lack of knowledge regarding youth depression amongst many primary
   health care (PHC) practitioners. The principal goal of the MEGA project
   is to provide youth with better access to mental health services and
   appropriate care, by developing a mental health screening mobile
   application tool to be used in PHC settings in South Africa and Zambia.
   In this study, we will use a mixed methods multi-center study design. In
   phase one, we will investigate the mental health literacy of PHC
   practitioners to identify areas in need of development. Based on the
   needs identified, we will develop and test a mobile health application
   to screen for common youth mental health problems in phase two. In phase
   three, we will implement and evaluate a tiered education and training
   program in the use of the m-health application. In the final phase, we
   will evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of the m-health
   application in PHC centres across South Africa and Zambia. Evidence
   suggests that PHC practitioners should routinely consider mental illness
   when assessing youth. However, common psychiatric disorders remain
   largely undetected and untreated in PHC settings. By identifying
   limitations in PHC workers knowledge with regard to youth mental health,
   we aspire to improve the depression care provided to youth in Southern
   Africa and Zambia by developing and implementing a locally relevant
   m-health application.},

Title = {Knowledge and attitudes of Dutch psychiatry residents towards anorexia
   nervosa},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EATING DISORDERS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 10},
Abstract = {BackgroundStigma significantly hinders treatment seeking, adherence to
   treatment, referrals, and can prolong recovery, while increasing the
   risk of relapse due to social exclusion and stress. Stigmatizing
   attitudes towards anorexia nervosa are widespread, and not only held by
   the general public, but also by professionals.ObjectiveAs stigmatizing
   attitudes towards mental disorders often develop early during education
   and training, the study's objective was to investigate stigmatizing
   attitudes towards anorexia nervosa among Dutch psychiatry residents, as
   well as their mental health literacy.MethodsIn this pilot study, Dutch
   psychiatry residents (N = 61) were surveyed, with a 49\% response rate,
   using a comprehensive questionnaire that included nine parts, covering
   multiple stigma domains, disease prestige, knowledge, and professional
   training.ResultsAnorexia nervosa was ranked 18th in disease prestige
   with a mean score of 6.23. Although most stigmatizing attitudes were not
   widely endorsed by psychiatry residents, there were a few notable
   exceptions, especially attitudes related to blame, fragility and social
   distance. They characterized patients as insecure, controlling, sad, and
   defensive, and reported feeling worried, incompetent, pessimistic and
   anxious when dealing with patients with anorexia nervosa. Only 37\% felt
   confident in diagnosing anorexia nervosa.ConclusionThere is a critical
   need for further research on the social value ranking of psychiatric
   disorders and the development of a comprehensive stigma scale, as well
   as targeted educational interventions. Addressing stigma through focused
   training programs could lead to better patient outcomes, improved
   treatment satisfaction, and reduced barriers to care for individuals
   with anorexia nervosa.},

Abstract = {Sleep difficulties are widespread among international students.
   Internet-based interventions are suggested as a low-threshold treatment
   option but may require cultural adaptation among culturally diverse
   populations. The present pilot study investigated the effectiveness and
   acceptance of an internet-based intervention to improve sleep
   difficulties in international students. A total of 81 international
   students of 36 nationalities were randomly assigned to the intervention
   (n = 41) or waitlist control group (n = 40). The intervention group
   received immediate access to a culturally non-adapted unguided
   internet-based sleep intervention consisting of three modules based on
   sleep hygiene and cognitive techniques to reduce rumination. At
   baseline, 4 and 12 weeks after randomisation, insomnia severity,
   measured by the Insomnia Severity Index, and secondary outcomes (sleep
   quality, depression, anxiety, perceived stress, well-being,
   presenteeism, mental health literacy) were assessed. Data were analysed
   using linear multi-level analyses. Additionally, satisfaction and
   perceived cultural appropriateness of the intervention were evaluated by
   international students after 4 weeks, and compared with ratings of
   German students, who represent the original target group. Insomnia
   severity improved over time in the intervention group compared to the
   control group, revealing a significant estimated mean difference of
   -5.60 (Hedges' g = 0.84, p < 0.001) after 12 weeks. Satisfaction and
   perceived cultural appropriateness was high and comparable to that of
   German students. The present study shows that a culturally non-adapted
   internet-based sleep intervention can be a low-threshold treatment
   option to help meet the high demand for mental healthcare among
   international students. It thus indicates that cultural adaptation might
   not represent a precondition for providing effective internet-based
   sleep interventions to this target group.},

Abstract = {Objectives: Student-athletes are unique in their undertaking of
   full-time academic and athletic roles. Their dual roles impose a
   multitude of responsibilities in their daily lives, yet little is known
   about the factors that may negatively impact their ability to
   effectively manage these responsibilities. Participants: Data from a
   large sample of Canadian varsity athletes (N = 1,353) were used for the
   present study. Methods: The association between stress and difficulties
   managing daily responsibilities, while simultaneously investigating the
   roles of sleep difficulties and sense of belonging as contributing
   factors was examined. Results: Findings indicated that the moderated
   mediation model was significant, revealing that sleep difficulties were
   a significant mediator in the relationship between stress and
   difficulties managing daily responsibilities and that sense of belonging
   moderated the relationship between stress and sleep difficulties.
   Conclusions: The results expose complex ways that student-athletes'
   performances (academic and athletic) can be impaired, signaling the need
   to develop strategic actions toward prevention and management of stress
   among student-athletes.},

Abstract = {Background Training healthcare professionals in human rights approaches
   is fundamental for humanizing medical practice and promoting patient
   autonomy.Aims To evaluate the impact of Quality Rights strategy training
   on human rights engagement, stigma reduction and attitudes towards
   mental health among medical students in Colombian.Method A
   pre-experimental study with pre-post measures was conducted, involving
   194 medical students, during the first semester of 2024 in Manizales,
   Caldas, Colombia. To assess notions and commitment to human rights were
   used the Human Rights Exposure in Social Work and Human Rights
   Engagement in Social Work. Attitudes toward people with mental disorders
   were measured using the Community Attitudes Towards the Mentally III
   (CAMI) scale, and attitudes toward mental health education were assessed
   using the Mental Illness Clinicians' Attitude Scale (MICA). The
   intervention was based on QualityRights, an initiative of the World
   Health Organization, which aims to improve the quality of care in mental
   health services and to promote the human rights of people with
   psychosocial disabilities. Initial data comparisons were made using the
   Mann-Whitney U test and the Kruskal-Wallis test. Pretest and postest
   data were compared using the Wilcoxon test.Results Statistically
   significant improvements were observed in human rights understanding,
   reduced stigmatizing attitudes toward mental health and decreased
   authoritarianism. While students demonstrated enhanced human rights
   knowledge and less stigmatizing attitudes, we observed a concurrent
   decrease in benevolence scores.Conclusion The Quality Rights training
   strategy shows promise in improving medical students' understanding of
   mental health conditions and promoting empathetic practices. However,
   ongoing sustained and monitoring strategies are necessary to ensure
   long-term adoption of human rights-based attitudes and practices in
   healthcare settings.},

Title = {The Gesundheitschamps-wir wissen um unsere Gesundheit Bescheid

   promotion for students with special needs},
Journal = {PRAVENTION UND GESUNDHEITSFORDERUNG},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 9},
Abstract = {BackgroundSocial inequalities in health and health literacy become
   evident in childhood and adolescence. There is a paucity of programmes
   aimed at enhancing health literacy among children and adolescents with
   special needs (e.g. support needs). Against this background, the
   Gesundheitschamps-wir wissen um unsere Gesundheit Bescheid project was
   developed. ObjectiveThis paper addresses three key areas: firstly, it
   provides an overview of programmes in the field of health literacy
   enhancement for students with special needs; secondly, it presents the
   study and evaluation design of the Gesundheitschamps intervention; and
   thirdly, it considers the requirements for the Gesundheitschamps
   intervention to promote health and health literacy in a way that is
   appropriate for the target group, taking into account the use of
   appropriate methods and implementation modes. MethodsTo create an
   overview of the current state of research, a literature search was
   conducted in selected databases and project registers (objective 1). A
   longitudinal study with a mixed-methods design (running from 2023-2026)
   is being developed and tested to enhance the health literacy of
   secondary school students, with a focus on learning disabilities and
   intellectual development and taking into account a high degree of
   participation (objective 2). To identify the requirements for
   interventions aimed at improving health literacy among students with
   special needs, initial results from comparable studies are analysed,
   which is supplemented by an overview of participatory methods for
   children and adolescents (objective 3). ResultsThe literature review
   reveals a significant lack of suitable programmes for the target group
   that consider participation and a peer-to-peer approach to enhancing
   health literacy. The Gesundheitschamps intervention contributes to
   enhancement of the knowledge and action competencies of students with
   special needs in key areas of national prevention guidelines (Leitfaden
   Pr \& auml;vention), including {[}mental] health literacy, nutrition,
   exercise and substance use. The specific needs of the target group
   require implementation of distinctive didactic and methodological
   approaches.},

Title = {What was done for young people aged 10 to 24 in Singapore? A systematic
   review on mental health interventions},
Journal = {CURRENT PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {43},

Abstract = {While Singapore is celebrated for its world-class economy and education
   system, it still grapples with mental health challenges among young
   people, highlighting the urgent need for early intervention and
   effective treatment for this population. Hence, this systematic review
   aimed to identify mental health interventions for young people aged 10
   to 24 in Singapore. Databases including PubMed, CINAHL Complete, APA
   PsycArticles, APA PsycInfo, and Scopus were searched until September 23,
   2023, resulting in the identification of five studies (N = 397)
   conducted between 2017 and 2023. They were analysed following the latest
   Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses
   (PRISMA) guideline, with the risk of bias and levels of evidence
   assessed. The studies covered diverse populations ranging from students
   to youth offenders, addressing various mental health concerns such as
   autism spectrum disorder, anxiety, social withdrawal, and mental health
   literacy. While three studies reported positive outcomes but two of them
   too raised concerns about measurement validity, intervention rigor, and
   sample size. Overall, the review revealed significant heterogeneity in
   both intervention outcomes and delivery methods among mental health
   interventions for young people in Singapore, making comparisons
   challenging and definitive conclusions difficult to draw. Additionally,
   the review underscored the scarcity of published interventions for this
   demographic, highlighting the urgent need for more tailored and
   evidence-based approaches. Nonetheless, it emphasizes the importance of
   addressing this gap and advocates for more research to inform
   evidence-based practices and policies, providing valuable insights for
   mental health professionals, policymakers, and researchers aiming to
   enhance the well-being of Singapore's young population.},

Title = {Is Digital Treatment the Holy Grail? Literature Review on Computerized
   and Blended Treatment for Depressive Disorders in Youth},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Computerized and blended treatments seem to be an attractive treatment
   for adolescents as an alternative to face-to-face treatment, but mental
   health professionals seem hesitant to use these treatment modalities.
   This review provides an overview of factors contributing to and
   withholding from using computerized or blended treatment in routine
   care. Three databases were searched with terms related to (1)
   adolescents, (2) depression, (3) computerized or blended, and (4)
   treatment. Of the 33 articles identified, 10 focused on unguided
   computerized treatments, six on guided, two on blended, two compared
   unguided, blended- and face-to-face treatment to no treatment, and eight
   studies on games. Further, two articles that were focused on an online
   monitoring tool and three on intervention characteristics or preferred
   modes of help-seeking. Evidence for effectiveness, adherence, drop-out,
   and forming therapeutic relations were suspected to be barriers, but are
   no reason to reject computerized or blended treatment. Improvement in
   mental health literacy and the possibility to tailor the intervention
   are facilitators. However, adolescents' intention to seek help,
   acceptability of computerized treatment, symptom severity, time spent by
   therapist, and other facilities are identified as barriers and they need
   to be taken into account when using computerized or blended
   interventions. Nevertheless, computerized and blended are promising
   treatments for depressed youth.},

Title = {Interventions to facilitate mental health help-seeking for young rural
   Australians through stigma reduction: a three-arm randomised trial},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN MENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 NOV 8},
Abstract = {ObjectiveThis study aimed to assess the effectiveness of two
   intervention strategies, Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy
   (ICBT) and Cognitive Bias Modification for Help-Seeking (CBM-HS), in
   modifying young, rural Australians' mental health help-seeking stigma to
   increase intentions to access mental health care within
   Australia.MethodA total of 42 young people (aged between 15 and 24
   years) participated in a three-armed randomised trial, with participants
   randomly allocated into one of the two interventions or the control
   condition. Data were collected pre-, post-, and at six weeks follow-up
   via self-report questionnaires. Main outcome measures: mental health
   help-seeking self-stigma, perceived public stigma, attitudes, and
   intentions to seek mental health help.ResultsThe results provided some
   support for the CBM-HS intervention as effective in decreasing
   self-stigma across the three time points compared to the other
   conditions. No significant effects were observed in the ICBT
   intervention. A significant increase in mean mental health literacy
   scores was also found between time points across all
   conditions.ConclusionsThese findings suggest that online anti-stigma
   interventions could feasibly be used to reduce help-seeking stigma among
   young rural Australians, which may help to increase the proportions of
   individuals seeking help for their mental health concerns.},

Pages = {76-85},
Abstract = {Introduction. Mental health disorders are increasingly common in
   adolescence, and peer stigma represents a significant barrier. Defining
   this construct is essential for its evaluation, prevention, and
   intervention. The aim of this study was to conceptualize mental disorder
   stigma in adolescents. Method. A scoping review was conducted in the Web
   of Science, Scopus, Eric, PubMed, and PsycInfo databases (2011-2021),
   using descriptors in both English and Spanish. A total of 11,144
   articles were retrieved; 51 were selected after screening, and six
   additional articles were included through other methods. Results. Social
   stigma in adolescents is described as negative beliefs that may lead to
   rejection and discriminatory behavior. Different types were identified
   (public stigma, selfstigma, structural stigma, and associative stigma).
   Stigma is considered a multidimensional construct (cognitive, emotional,
   and behavioral dimensions) and is influenced by variables such as sex,
   nationality, educational level, age, socioeconomic status, personal
   experience, mental health literacy, and help-seeking behavior.
   Discussion. Most studies are grounded in the theoretical contributions
   of Goffman and Corrigan. Recent literature highlights the urgent need to
   develop effective, sustainable, and culturally adapted prevention
   programs. The lack of consensus on conceptual and methodological
   frameworks hinders comparison across studies, reinforcing the importance
   of valid instruments tailored to adolescents. Identifying factors that
   influence stigma is essential to guide more inclusive educational
   interventions.},

Abstract = {The investigation on mental health and physical exercise condition of
   the middle school students shows: the overall mental health condition of
   the middle school students is normal but worse than the norm of
   teen-agers in the whole country: the mental health condition of boy
   students is better than that of the girl students and the mental health
   condition of physical education participants is obviously better than
   that of those who do not participate in physical education. In view of
   the above, the paper puts forward some practical suggestions, thereby
   providing scientific basis for the mental health educational and
   management work of middle school students, offering the foundation for
   the further formulation of preventive measures for school mental health
   work and implementation of mental health education for students in P.E.
   teaching and helping play a better supporting role in the smooth
   implementation of P.E. reform and New Curriculum Standard in Chinese

Title = {Adolescent and Young Adult Male Mental Health: Transforming System
   Failures Into Proactive Models of Engagement},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT HEALTH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {62},
Number = {3, S},
Pages = {S9-S17},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Adolescent and young adult men do poorly on indicators of mental health
   evidenced by elevated rates of suicide, conduct disorder, substance use,
   and interpersonal violence relative to their female peers. Data on
   global health burden clearly demonstrate that young men have a markedly
   distinct health risk profile from young women, underscoring different
   prevention and intervention needs. Evidence indicates that boys
   disconnect from health-care services during adolescence, marking the
   beginning of a progression of health-care disengagement and associated
   barriers to care, including presenting to services differently,
   experiencing an inadequate or poorly attuned clinical response, and
   needing to overcome pervasive societal attitudes and self-stigma to
   access available services. This review synthesizes key themes related to
   mental ill health in adolescent boys and in young adult men. Key social
   determinants are discussed, including mental health literacy,
   self-stigma and shame, masculinity, nosology and diagnosis, and service
   acceptability. A call is made for focused development of policy, theory,
   and evaluation of targeted interventions for this population, including
   gender-synchronized service model reform and training of staff,
   including the e-health domain. Such progress is expected to yield
   significant social and economic benefits, including reduction to mental
   ill health and interpersonal violence displayed by adolescent boys and
   young adult men. (c) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of

Title = {`A mouthpiece to make a positive impact': Australian journalists'
   attitudes, knowledge, and experiences reporting on mental ill-health and
   suicide in sportspeople},
Journal = {MEDIA INTERNATIONAL AUSTRALIA},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 SEP 12},
Abstract = {The media is a significant source of information about mental health and
   can considerably influence public attitudes. Elite sportspeople are role
   models for young people and prominent figures in Australian culture.
   However, little is known about journalists' attitudes, experiences, and
   training needs for reporting on mental ill-health and suicide in
   high-profile athletes and coaches. An invitation email for a
   cross-sectional online survey was sent directly to journalists. The
   survey included demographic characteristics, and measures assessing
   their knowledge and attitudes towards mental health and suicide, and
   views, experiences and training needs for reporting on mental ill-health
   and suicide in sportspeople. Inductive qualitative content analysis of
   the written responses was conducted, and mean scores and percentages
   were calculated for the quantitative measures. A total of 81 Australian
   journalists (43 identified as women; 38 identified as men) aged 22-76
   years (M = 22.0, SD = 13.8) participated in the study. Participants had
   diverse opinions on the media's responsibility when reporting mental
   health and suicide in elite sportspeople, with some believing they had
   an important role in reducing stigma. Notably, almost half of the
   participants had never received training on how to report on mental
   ill-health and suicide. Given that there are no current guidelines for
   reporting on these issues for sportspeople, further training resources
   are likely to be beneficial. However, training format, content and
   delivery may need to be shaped around journalists' preferences and
   information needs, including delivery by experts such as those with
   lived experience, researchers, and practitioners.},

Title = {Does Mental Health First Aid training improve the mental health of aid
   recipients? The training for parents of teenagers randomised controlled
   trial},
Journal = {BMC PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Month = {MAR 27},
Abstract = {BackgroundThere is well-established evidence that Mental Health First
   Aid (MHFA) training improves knowledge about how to support someone
   developing a mental health problem, but less evidence that this support
   improves the mental health of the recipient of aid. This randomised
   controlled trial aimed to assess the long-term effects of MHFA training
   of parents on the mental health of their adolescent children.Methods384
   Australian parents of an adolescent aged 12-15 were randomised to
   receive either the 14-h Youth MHFA course or the 15-h Australian Red
   Cross Provide First Aid course. Outcomes were assessed at baseline,
   1-year, and 2-year follow-up in both parents and adolescents. Primary
   outcomes were cases of adolescent mental health problems, and parental
   support towards their adolescent if they developed a mental health
   problem, rated by the parent and adolescent. Secondary outcomes included
   parent knowledge about mental health problems, intentions and confidence
   in supporting a young person, stigmatizing attitudes, and help-seeking
   for mental health problems.ResultsParent and adolescent reports showed
   no significant difference between training groups in the proportion of
   cases of adolescents with a mental health problem over time (ps>.05).
   There was also no significant difference between training groups in the
   quality of parental support provided to their adolescent at 1- or 2-year
   follow-up (ps>.05). In contrast, some secondary outcomes showed benefits
   from the Youth MHFA training relative to the control, with increased
   parental knowledge about mental health problems at 1-year (d=0.43) and
   2-year follow-up (d=0.26), and increased confidence to help a young
   person (d=0.26) and intentions to provide effective support (d=0.22) at
   1-year follow-up.ConclusionsThe study showed some improvements in mental
   health literacy in training recipients, but could not detect changes in
   the mental health of adolescents and the support provided to them by
   their parents if they had a mental health problem. However, there was a
   lack of power to detect primary outcome effects and therefore the
   question of whether MHFA training leads to better outcomes in the
   recipients of aid remains to be further explored.Trial

Title = {The effect of a low intensity intervention on the wellbeing of children
   in the juvenile justice system in India: Results from a pilot study},
Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {108},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Objective Children in the Juvenile Justice System (JJS) face multiple
   adversities that may predispose them to developing mental health (MH)
   problems. Interventions that enhance the MH and well-being of these
   children while providing access to appropriate MH care are needed. This
   study examines the effect of a multipronged, low-intensity intervention
   on adolescents' well-being, stress levels, MH knowledge, and stigma
   perceptions in Childcare Institutions (CCIs) across Odisha and Tamil
   Nadu, India. Methods Implemented in 7 CCIs, the intervention aimed to
   enhance the MH Literacy (MHL) and well-being of children in the CCIs
   through the Youth-Friendly Spaces (YFS) using experiential methods. It
   also sought to improve the MHL of the staff and administration within
   the JJS and provide access to MH care by linking CCIs to available local
   resources. Information using validated scales was obtained at baseline
   and six months. Results Only 180 of the 310 children for whom baseline
   data was available remained in the CCI at six months. A statistically
   significant improvement in well-being (34.5 +13.7-55.9 +12.2, p <
   0.001), stress (18.5 +6.8-17 +6.1, p = 0.044) and stigma (32 +11.9-29.4
   +11.4, p = 0.023) scores were observed. Adjusted linear regression
   analysis showed significant differences across genders, sites, and child
   types. Discussion This intervention, comprising YFS creation, MHL
   enhancement, and referral system development, is significantly
   associated with improved well-being of children in CCIs. The results
   underscore the need for tailored interventions based on gender,
   location, and child type. The study highlights the potential scalability
   of such programs in resource-constrained settings for vulnerable
   children.},

Title = {The role of professional football clubs in enhancing young people's
   mental health: a mixed-method survey of interventions delivered by
   English Football League Trusts},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 JUL 3},
Abstract = {Aims: Football Club Community Trusts (FCCTs) that are attached to
   professional football clubs in the UK use the sport brand to engage
   marginalised populations in various initiatives designed to address
   public health agendas. Studies highlight the impact that FCCTs can have
   on adults' mental health, yet less is known about programmes for young
   people under 18 years. This study is the first to identify the mental
   health-focussed interventions for young people that are delivered by the
   FCCTs in the English Football League (EFL), including the key programme
   features and challenges to implementation.Methods: A 60-item
   mixed-method survey was sent to all 70 FCCTs in the EFL during the
   2018-2019 season in September 2018. In total, 54 (77.1\%) FCCTs
   responded.Results: In total, 21 FCCTs were delivering mental
   health-focused interventions to young people and 23 different
   initiatives were identified. Reported aims included promoting resilience
   (n = 19/21, 90.5\%) and self-esteem (n = 19/21, 90.5\%), as well as
   identifying young people at risk of developing a mental health problem
   (n = 9/21, 42.9\%). However, features of individual programmes varied.
   Some used football to increase social inclusion and overall wellbeing,
   whereas others included education sessions to improve mental health
   literacy (e.g. anti-stigma, strategies to promote mental health). FCCTs
   also reported challenges with evaluating their own interventions,
   sustaining funding, and keeping up to date with mental health
   training.Conclusions: This study contributes to the limited literature
   on professional sport club community trust interventions, highlighting
   the value of programmes targeting children and young people's mental
   health. FCCT programmes align with mental health promotion and
   prevention policy, by providing opportunities to participate in physical
   activity (PA), develop mental health literacy, and identify young people
   at risk of developing mental health problems. Collaboration with
   organisations with expertise in service evaluation, audit, and research
   is essential to support FCCTs in evaluating their impact and
   demonstrating the significance of their work.},

Abstract = {The present study aimed to identify overall stress and salient stressors
   experienced by adolescents from different education tracks and
   self-perceived ethnic backgrounds. A total of 1489 adolescents (M =
   13.40 years; SD = 0.89 years) from nine Dutch secondary schools
   participated. Self-reported stressors were measured with the adapted
   version of the Adolescent Stress Questionnaire - Short. After
   controlling for age, gender, country of birth, and school classes,
   results showed that overall stress did not differ for educational track
   nor for ethnic background subgroups. Adolescents in academic education
   reported more stress from school-related stressors than adolescents
   attending vocational education. Adolescents with a mixed ethnic
   background (i.e., Dutch and another ethnicity) reported more stress
   regarding school-related stressors than adolescents with a Dutch ethnic
   background. These differences between adolescents of different
   educational tracks and ethnic backgrounds have implications for
   intervention programs targeting specific stressors.},

Abstract = {China accounts for an estimated third of the world's suicides, yet
   individuals experiencing suicidality typically do not seek out or
   receive treatment. This study examines community perceptions and public
   stigma toward suicide. In Shanghai, China 186 adults were recruited to
   participate in a survey with an experimental vignette describing a
   suicidal individual, manipulated on gender and age, followed by
   questions eliciting attitudes toward suicide. Most participants agreed
   that the suicidal subject had a serious problem, with seriousness of the
   problem decreasing with participant's age. Participants reported
   moderate levels of public stigma. More stigma was found toward
   adolescent subjects rather than adult. Male subjects were perceived as
   being more likely to change than females. The public's accurate view of
   suicide without biases could help prevent suicide from getting worse.
   Public perceptions regarding a suicidal individual's likelihood to
   change could lead to stigma reduction, which can subsequently help with
   effective crisis intervention.},

Abstract = {Lived experience education occupies an increasingly important space in
   mental health education for social workers. Despite being plagued by
   practices that continue to be discriminating and exclusionary, the
   mental health policy and practice context demand robust attention to the
   meaningful inclusion of service users and their families to achieve
   genuine partnership, reciprocity, and equality in mental health service
   provision. For social work educators, lived experience education is now
   an indispensable component of a critically informed mental health
   curriculum and pedagogy. Framed within an appeal for epistemic justice,
   this article reports on qualitative survey data from social work
   students who experienced teaching from people with lived experience.
   Findings show that students greatly valued lived experience education,
   as it created opportunities for authentic and more diverse
   understandings of mental health that fostered critical reflection. A
   curriculum that supports epistemic equality and a social justice agenda
   would help scaffold lived experience expertise for student
   learning.IMPLICATIONS Mental health lived experience education
   positively impacts social work students' values and attitudes towards
   mental health service users.Lived experience education supports social
   work students to expand their understandings of mental health and
   recovery beyond dominant biomedical perspectives.Genuine valuing of
   lived experience knowledge and expertise in social work education helps
   address epistemic injustice.},

Abstract = {The mobile Internet gender psychological education curriculum for
   primary school students takes positive development as the core idea,
   which has high value for improving the quality of primary school
   students' mental health education. The teaching evaluation of this
   course can improve the efficiency and effect of teaching, and provide
   reference and help for future teaching. However, the current effect
   evaluation methods have the problem of single evaluation. Therefore,
   this paper studies the evaluation method of mobile online course effect
   of gender psychological education for primary school students. This
   paper analyzes the content of gender psychology education for primary
   school students, and establishes a teaching model of gender psychology
   education on mobile networks by using the interactive relationship
   between learners and learning resources. Establish an evaluation index
   system according to the course content and teaching interaction mode.
   Based on the theory of fuzzy mathematics, the evaluation model of the
   effect of gender psychology education curriculum for primary school
   students is established. The corresponding weight values are obtained by
   using the fuzzy consistent judgment matrix, and the numerical results of
   comprehensive evaluation are obtained. The experimental results show
   that the designed course effect evaluation method can improve the
   accuracy of evaluation and the evaluation results are more convincing.},

Abstract = {Background: Inferiority complex is a common psychological disorder
   occurring in adolescents during their psychological development and the
   root cause of most psychological problems. However, inferiority complex
   in adolescents has rarely been examined in previous intervention
   studies. This practice-oriented study combined character strengths
   theory with group psychological counseling to examine adolescents with
   high inferiority complex scores. Methods: A survey was conducted on 512
   adolescents selected using convenience sampling from three middle
   schools in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, to collect information
   regarding the degree and characteristics of their inferiority complex.
   Those with a high inferiority complex score were recruited for a grouped
   experiment, where the experiment group received group counseling
   grounded on character strengths theory. Results: The participants had a
   moderately high degree of inferiority complex (mean = 2.92). Significant
   differences were observed in the total inferiority complex score across
   gender, left-behind experience, and academic performance (P < 0.05).
   After the intervention, the inferiority complex score of the experiment
   group was significantly lower than that of the control group, and the
   difference was statistically significant (P< 0.05). Conclusion: The
   intervention model constructed in this study effectively reduces
   inferiority complex in adolescents, providing a reference for exploring
   an effective approach to adolescent-targeted mental health education.},

   a larger study on a mental health education program. Data from this
   study permitted testing of roles of demographics in these social
   cognitive models. Subsequent analyses using manifest model structural
   equations were mixed, but mostly showed adequate fit for multiple
   versions of the models. These results suggest that models of blame and
   dangerousness are relevant to the way 10 to 13-year-olds stigmatize
   mental illness. Demographics were not found to fit these models
   satisfactorily. Implications of these findings for stigma-change agenda
   are discussed.},

Abstract = {Young adults experiencing mental health problems often need both
   individual support and educational accommodations to successfully
   complete their studies. Recent research also points to the need for
   career-related, educational services in a labor market that increasingly
   demands formal education or training.
   The aim of this study was to investigate the development of supported
   education services in Sweden, in relation to pursuing educational and
   vocational goals. Interviews were conducted with a broad sample of
   stakeholders who are currently developing supported education services,
   as well as young adults utilizing educational support.
   The results suggest a number of key factors for accommodating the needs
   of these students which include, in addition to basic academic, mental
   health and individual supports, attention to economic challenges, social
   contexts and improved mental health literacy for educational actors. The
   results additionally substantiate the relevance of educational supports
   to long-term vocational goals when providing employment support

Title = {The Impact of a Messenger-Based Psychosocial Chat Counseling Service on
   Further Help-Seeking Among Children and Young Adults: Longitudinal Study},
Journal = {JMIR MENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Abstract = {Background: Mental crises have high prevalences in adolescence. Early
   interventions appear to be highly important to diminish the risk of the
   deterioration, recurrence, or chronification of symptoms. In recent
   years, various providers have started offering live chat support in
   psychological crises. The messenger-based psychological counseling
   service krisenchat aims to support young people in crises and, if
   necessary, provide a recommendation for a referral to the health care
   system or to seek further help from a trusted adult person.Objective:
   This study aimed to investigate the impact of using the counseling
   service of krisenchat on the further help-seeking behavior of young
   people, and to identify associated factors of further
   help-seeking.Methods: This longitudinal study analyzed anonymous data
   from 247 individuals who used krisenchat between October 2021 and March
   2022, and received a recommendation for further help-seeking. An online
   survey directly after the chat assessed the perceived helpfulness of the
   chat and well-being after the chat. After 4 weeks, further help-seeking,
   facilitators and barriers to help-seeking, and self-efficacy were
   assessed in an online follow-up survey.Results: The most frequently
   recommended services or persons to seek further help from included a
   psychotherapist or social psychiatric service (75/225, 33.3\%), a school
   psychologist or school social worker (52/225, 23.1\%), and the user's
   parents (45/225, 20.0\%). Of the 247 users, 120 (48.6\%) indicated that
   they contacted the recommended service or person, and of these, 87
   (72.5\%) stated that they already had an appointment (or talk) with the
   respective service or person or that an appointment (or talk) was
   scheduled. The most frequently reported facilitators for further
   help-seeking were mental health literacy (54/120, 45.0\%), improvement
   of self-efficacy (55/120, 45.8\%), and symptom recognition (40/120,
   33.3\%). In users not displaying further help-seeking behavior, the most
   frequent barriers included stigmatization (60/127, 47.2\%), lack of
   mental health literacy (59/127, 46.5\%), need for self-reliance and
   autonomy (53/127, 41.7\%), and negative family beliefs regarding help
   services (53/127, 41.7\%). Subgroup comparisons indicated significantly
   higher levels of self-efficacy in users displaying further help-seeking
   behavior than in those not displaying further help-seeking behavior.
   Both subgroups did not differ in gender, age, recommended service or
   person, chat topics, perceived helpfulness, and well-being.Conclusions:
   The findings of this study indicate that children and young adults
   receiving counseling on krisenchat benefit in terms of seeking further
   help. Further help-seeking seems to be associated with higher levels of
   self-efficacy.Trial Registration: Deutsches Register Klinischer Studien

   Psychological Distress and Quality of Life in Paediatric Renal
   Transplant Patients},
Journal = {BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {2016},
Abstract = {Psychosocial distress and poorer quality of life after renal
   transplantation are common in children and young people. This has
   implications for medication adherence and survival. Posttransplant
   psychology annual reviews were introduced in one Paediatric Renal
   Service in the UK as a means of measuring psychological distress and
   quality of life, as well as facilitating identification of patients and
   parents/carers who would benefit from psychological intervention. The
   process of completing posttransplant psychology annual reviews is
   discussed within this paper. The posttransplant psychology annual review
   appointments identified patients experiencing depression and/or anxiety
   and problems in quality of life. These assessments have led to
   appropriate referrals to, and engagement with, the renal psychology
   service as well as with community tier 3 child and adolescent mental
   health services. The posttransplant psychology annual review will
   continue to be completed at this UK site and discussions will be
   undertaken with other paediatric renal transplant services to consider
   whether these could be introduced at a national level to facilitate
   collection of longitudinal data regarding long-term psychosocial impact
   of paediatric renal transplantation and its effect on quality of life.},

Abstract = {Schools have a critical role to play within the broader system of care
   supporting children, youth, and families. For 6 h each day, 10 months of
   the year, schools have the opportunity to support social emotional skill
   development, enhance mental health literacy, encourage help-seeking, and
   provide daily classroom support to students who are struggling with
   mental health problems. Many school districts also have the capacity to
   provide evidence-based preventive services, crisis response, assessment,
   and brief intervention services. However, when school-based mental
   health promotion and prevention services are not offered within the
   context of a comprehensive local/regional system of care, students
   requiring more intensive supports may not receive needed intervention.
   Further, best and emerging practices across contexts may not get
   evaluated or shared, and responses to acute needs that transcend
   geography may be disjointed and confusing. Using a broader system lens,
   there are policy and practice opportunities for cross-sectoral
   integration that, when leveraged using system science principles, can
   lead to more efficient and high-yield service delivery for children,
   youth, and families as well as system-wide responses to emerging issues
   or acute circumstances (e.g., suicide cluster, influx of child refugees,
   high profile media events). Drawing on the modified interactive systems
   framework and highlighting examples from the provincial rollout of
   Ontario's Comprehensive Mental Health and Addictions Strategy, a number
   of system-scale implementation science principles are shared with a view
   to optimizing the promise of school mental health, beyond silos.},

Abstract = {Objective To explore the efficacy of short-term trauma stabilization
   techniques combined with escitalopram in the treatment of adolescent
   major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods A total of 80 patients with MDD
   who were hospitalized in the Psychosomatic Department of our hospital
   were selected and randomly divided into two groups: the escitalopram
   combined with short-term trauma stabilization technique group (study
   group) and the escitalopram combined with mental health education group
   (control group). Upon hospitalization, patients completed the adolescent
   self-rating life events check list (ASLEC), impact of event
   scale-revised (IES-R), 17-item Hamilton depression scale (HAMD-17) and
   Hamilton anxiety scale (HAMA). After 2 and 4 weeks of treatment, the
   IES-R, HAMD-17-17 and HAMA scores were reevaluated. Results There were
   no significant differences in the ASLEC, IES-R, HAMD-17 or HAMA scores
   between the two groups at admission. Compared with that of the control
   group, the IES-R score of the study group was significantly improved at
   the 2nd week of treatment (P < 0.01). By the 4th week of treatment, the
   IES-R scores in the study group had further improved compared to the
   control group (P < 0.01). Additionally, the HAMD-17 and HAMA scores in
   the study group were significantly improved compared to the control
   group (P < 0.01). Conclusion Escitalopram combined with short-term
   trauma stabilization is more effective in the treatment of MDD than
   escitalopram with mental health education, warranting further
   exploration.},

Title = {Category characteristics of high school students' sense of hope and its
   relationship with mental health},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Month = {FEB 20},
Abstract = {PurposeThis study used the latent profile analysis technique to
   investigate the latent categories of high school students' sense of hope
   and their relationship with mental health. MethodsA total of 1,513 high
   school students from six middle schools in China was tested using the
   Adult Dispositional Hope Scale and the Symptom Checklist 90. Analysis of
   variance was used to explore the relationship between latent categories
   of sense of hope and mental health. ResultsHigh school students' sense
   of hope scores are negatively associated with mental health scores. The
   high school students' sense of hope could be divided into three latent
   categories: negative sense of hope group, moderate sense of hope group
   and positive sense of hope group. The differences in scores on each
   dimension of mental health among high school students with different
   latent categories of sense of hope were statistically significant. The
   positive sense of hope group had lower scores on the dimensions of
   somatization, compulsive symptoms, interpersonal sensitivity,
   depression, anxiety, hostility, terror, paranoia, and psychosis than the
   negative sense of hope group and the moderate sense of hope group.
   ConclusionThere are three latent categories of high school students'
   sense of hope, and the sense of hope category is closely related to
   mental health. Based on the different categories of high school
   students' sense of hope, the program of mental health education can be
   reasonably selected to create a positive general environment for mental
   health education and ultimately enhance the mental health of high school
   students.},

Abstract = {Background: Preparation support-defined as structured, age-appropriate
   educational and psychological interventions to familiarize patients with
   upcoming procedures-is important for emotionally vulnerable children
   undergoing heart surgery. Objectives: This pilot study evaluated a
   preparation program for pediatric cardiac surgery patients and
   identified effective components for psychological support. Methods: Six
   patients (aged 5-16 years) undergoing cardiac surgery and their parents
   participated in our preparation program, which included role-play with
   medical equipment, age-appropriate videos demonstrating perioperative
   flow and sensory information, and coping strategy instruction. Data were
   collected through perioperative observations, post-discharge interviews
   with children, and parental questionnaires, then analyzed using
   qualitative content analysis. Results: Preparatory counseling improved
   illness acceptance, treatment motivation, and self-coping skills during
   the perioperative period. Children demonstrated positive emotional and
   cooperative responses during hospitalization, with qualitative analysis
   revealing two main categories of children's experiences: 1)
   understanding of treatment and sense of accomplishment, and 2)
   fluctuating anxiety and stress. Parental responses similarly formed two
   categories: concerns about communication and expectations for healthcare
   collaboration. Some children initially experienced increased fear that
   typically resolved over time. Conclusion: Preparation counseling
   effectively supports pediatric cardiac surgery patients psychologically
   while helping parents provide appropriate emotional support. The mixed
   emotional responses observed highlight the need for ongoing program
   refinement. Enhanced preparation programs specifically designed for
   children with congenital heart disease can reduce psychological distress
   during extended hospitalizations and improve overall well-being in this
   vulnerable population.},

Title = {A Mixed Methods Assessment of an Online Mental Health and Resilience

Abstract = {Financial, environmental, and socio-cultural challenges affect the
   mental health and wellbeing of those working and living on-farm.
   Education programs can help in improving mental health and overall
   wellbeing, but most of these programs are offered to established farmers
   in a face-to-face format, leading to a gap in offerings to many
   subgroups, including young agricultural entrants. To address these gaps,
   this paper assesses the value of an online mental health and resilience
   education program for young agricultural entrants. An explanatory
   sequential mixed methods approach was applied. Firstly, a quantitative
   survey was conducted with 172 first year agricultural tertiary students,
   aged 18-20, to assess the knowledge and skills gained due to program
   participation. Regressions and propensity score matching were used to
   determine the effect of program participation. Subsequently, seven
   interviews were conducted with program participants to provide insights
   into their experiences of the program. Thematic coding was applied to
   analyze the qualitative data. Findings from the quantitative survey show
   a significant increase in mental health knowledge and skills amongst
   program participants compared to participants in the control group. The
   qualitative interviews show the ability to work through the material in
   their own time and space, creates a safe environment for online
   students. Other mechanisms contributing to learning are using ``normal
   language{''}, a peer voice in communicating wellbeing, and building on
   learnings in previous education. This paper addresses a gap in
   literature by being the first study to evaluate online mental health
   education for agricultural tertiary students. It provides educators and
   other program designers with valuable information for future program
   design to support the wellbeing of young agricultural workers.},

Abstract = {Nursing students' beliefs about etiology and manifestation of mental
   illness will impact on their professional attitudes in future clinical
   practice. The aims of the present study were to examine and compare US
   and Chinese undergraduate nursing students' recognition of, and beliefs
   about, causes of depression and schizophrenia. A total of 310 US (n =
   152) and Chinese (n = 158) nursing students completed the Australian
   National Mental Health Literacy Survey questionnaire between April 2016
   and April 2017. Although nursing students in the USA and China were
   highly accurate in recognizing depression and schizophrenia, the US
   students were more likely to nominate multiple items alongside the
   correct diagnosis than the Chinese students. The Chinese students were
   more likely to view depression and schizophrenia as
   multi-causally-determined mental disorders than the US students. The
   findings highlight the need for the incorporation of mental health
   issues, including symptomatology of different mental disorders and their
   application to patient care, into various aspects of the US nursing
   curriculum. In China, opportunities can be created for nursing students
   to discuss the impact of personal beliefs on care delivery and social
   stigma during clinical placement.},

Abstract = {Given the ongoing youth mental health crisis amid limited resources,
   young people and their families need sustainable, low-cost school-based
   interventions to support their wellbeing and connect them to vital

   and parents. This study used qualitative methods to analyze diverse high
   school student, young adult, and parent reports of accessing in-person
   school-based mental health supports and use of health-related apps.
   Two-thirds of young people reported using health-related apps with
   common use related to entertainment, fitness, and mental health. Further
   qualitative analysis regarding access identified themes around
   availability, experience with services, and normalizing mental health
   vs. stigma in schools. Findings suggest opportunities for digital
   interventions to increase mental health literacy and address stigma
   through psychoeducation. Digital health tools may support schools as an
   adjunct to in-person services in reaching under-resourced students in

   Methods. 3 005 12-to-17 year-olds in Mexico City were evaluated in 2005
   with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Descriptive and
   logistic regression analyses considered the multistage weighted sample
   design. Results. NEET youth as well as those who work only or study and
   work simultaneously have greater odds of psychiatric disorder, substance
   use and suicidal behavior compared to those who study exclusively even
   after controlling for social disadvantage. Conclusion. Vulnerability is
   not circumscribed to NEET adolescents, but to all teens who are not

Abstract = {Background. The persistent-and disabling nature of psychiatric stigma
   has led to the. establishment of global programmes to challenge the
   negative stereotypes and discriminatory responses that generate social
   disability, but these initiatives are rarely evaluated.
   Aims To assess the effectiveness of an intervention with young people
   aimed at increasing,mental health literacy and challenging negative
   stereotypes associated with severe mental illness.
   Method A total of 472 secondary school students attended two mental
   health awareness workshops and completed pre- and post-questionnaires
   detailing knowledge, attitudes and behavioural intentions.
   Results Young people use an extensive vocabulary of 270 different words
   and phrases to describe people with m ental health problems: most were
   derogatory terms. Mean positive attitude scores rose significantly from
   1.2 at baseline to 2.8 at 1-week follow-up and 2.3 at a 6-month
   follow-up. Changes were most marked for female students and those
   reporting personal contact with people with mental illness.
   Conclusions Short educational workshops can produce positive changes in
   participants' reported attitudes towards people with mental health
   problems.

Abstract = {Psychological stress has been found to he associated with a variety of
   ailments and health outcomes in adolescents. This study investigated the
   relationships between perceived stress, general self-efficacy and mental
   health status among Iranian male adolescents recruited from midtown high
   schools in Tehran who studied in 12th grade (N = 148). Pupils completed
   three questionnaires for assessing perceived stress (PSS-14; Cohen,
   Kamarck, \& Mermelstein, 1983), general self-efficacy (GSE; Schwarzer \&
   Jerusalem, 1995) and psychological well-being (GHQ-28; Goldberg \&
   Hillier, 1979). Statistical analysis revealed that greater stress was
   associated with lower general self-efficacy and lower mental health
   status. A significant inverse relationship between self-efficacy and
   general health was found among these students. Results are discussed in
   relation to their implications for effective mental health education
   (e.g., stress management training) for adolescents.},

Abstract = {Background: Adolescence is crucial period for laying the foundations for
   healthy development and mental wellbeing. The increasing prevalence of
   mental disorders amongst adolescents makes promotion of mental
   well-being and prevention interventions at schools important. UPRIGHT
   (Universal Preventive Resilience Intervention Globally implemented in
   schools to improve and promote mental Health for Teenagers) is designed
   as a whole school approach (school community, students and families) to
   promote a culture of mental well-being and prevent mental disorders by
   enhancing resilience capacities. The present article aims at describing
   the rationale, conceptual framework, as well as methodology of
   implementation and evaluation of the UPRIGHT intervention.
   Methods: UPRIGHT project is a research and innovation project funded by
   the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme
   under grant agreement No. 754919 (Duration: 48 months). The theoretical
   framework has been developed by an innovative and multidisciplinary
   approach using a co-creation process inside the UPRIGHT Consortium
   (involving seven institutions from Spain, Italy, Poland, Norway,
   Denmark, and Iceland). Resulted is the UPRIGHT programme with 18 skills
   related to 4 components: Mindfulness, Coping, Efficacy and Social and
   Emotional Learning. Among the five Pan-European regions, 34 schools have
   been currently involved (17 control; 17 intervention) and around 6000
   adolescents and their families are foreseen to participate along a
   3-year period of evaluation. Effectiveness of the intervention will be
   evaluated as a randomized controlled trial including quantitative and
   qualitative analysis in the five Pan-European regions representative of
   the cultural and socioeconomic diversity. The cost-effectiveness
   assessment will be performed by simulation modelling methods.
   Discussion: We expect a short- to medium-term improvement of mental
   well-being in adolescents by enhancing resilience capacities. The study
   may provide robust evidence on intrapersonal, familiar and social
   environmental resilience factors promoting positive mental well-being.

Abstract = {Introduction. Lack of information may result in health professionals'
   negative attitudes toward individuals with mental illness. Objective. We
   sought to determine the association between the perception of
   aggressiveness-dangerousness and illness recognition, suggested
   treatment, and attitudes regarding schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in
   a group of medical students. Method. This field study used a
   non-experimental, cross-sectional comparative design in a purposive
   sample of medical students. Mental illness recognition, beliefs about
   adequate treatment, perception of patient's
   aggressiveness-dangerousness, and attitudes toward severe mentally ill
   persons were assessed with previously validated instruments. Results. Of
   the 104 participants, 54.8\% identified a mental health condition in the
   schizophrenia vignette compared with only 3.8\% in the case of bipolar
   disorder. Most students believed that both diagnoses could lead to
   aggressive behaviors. Dangerousness was more frequently perceived in the
   schizophrenia vignette. Discussion and conclusion. It is necessary to
   sensitize and educate medical students so they have accurate information
   about symptoms and available treatments for individuals with mental
   illnesses.},

Abstract = {Secondary school students undergo significant psychological and
   physiological changes during adolescence, increasing their vulnerability
   to mental health issues. However, existing mental health services are
   inadequate to address the growing demand. To bridge this gap, we
   developed WarmGPT, a conversational mental health service robot
   utilizing a large language model integrated with cognitive- behavioral
   therapy, aimed at supporting secondary school students. In this study,
   40 students from a Chinese secondary school were randomly assigned to an
   experimental group or a control group. The experimental group received 2
   weeks of counseling through WarmGPT, whereas the control group viewed
   mental health education videos. Emotional states were evaluated before
   and after the intervention using scales measuring depression, anxiety,
   and positive and negative affect. Results indicated that the large
   language model-based WarmGPT significantly reduced depression, anxiety,
   and negative emotions and increased positive emotions among the
   students, outperforming the control group. These findings suggest that
   large language model-based conversational agents such as WarmGPT are
   effective in alleviating negative emotions and enhancing overall mental
   health in secondary school students, offering a promising new approach
   for mental health interventions.},

Abstract = {Psychoeducation can be defined as a systematic didactic and
   psychotherapeutic intervention which aims to inform patients and
   relatives on a psychiatric disorder and to enable their ability to cope
   with the illness. This is not only a transmission of information, but
   also a teaching method adjusted to the disorder with the objectives to
   clarify identity, to promote empowerment and to change attitudes and
   behavior. The introduction of the education in the treatment of mental
   disorders is at the origin of the ``moral treatment{''}. The term of
   psychoeducation was born originally in the scientific literature to
   overcome problems in formal learning among children with mental health
   problems. This origin is common with the term of therapeutic education,
   which has been then applied mainly to somatic health problems. The term
   psychoeducation was then used from 1980s to describe the transmission of
   knowledge on psychiatric disorders for therapeutic purposes, first to
   relatives, then to people suffering from schizophrenia. Since the end of
   the 1990s, the use of psychoeducation was then extended to other
   psychological disorders such as eating disorders, bipolar disorder,
   panic attacks and agoraphobia or posttraumatic stress disorders.
   Therapeutic efficacy of family psychoeducation to reduce the risk of
   relapse and readmission in schizophrenia was a revolution in family
   therapy during the 1980s. In a polemical way, psychoeducation was
   criticized as a way to impose a conception of mental illness by medical
   doctors and pharmaceutical industry. However, by the end of the 1990s,
   psychoeducation became clearly a source of power, knowledge and social
   connections for patients and relatives. In conclusion, psychoeducation
   has an evidence-based efficacy to prevent relapse and hospitalisation
   when associated with other treatments, including medication or
   psychosocial rehabilitation. In a modern medical perspective, it
   precedes and supplements in psychiatry the notions of ``informed
   consent{''}, ``shared decision-making{''} or ``mental health
   literacy{''}. In the limitations, psychoeducation remains not enough
   systemically used, some programs are not recovery compatible. Moreover,
   specific programs independent from diagnosis for the early phases of
   psychiatric disorders should be developed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Abstract = {BackgroundEffective parenting can mediate the negative impact of complex
   humanitarian emergencies (CHEs) on child mental health, however many
   caregivers struggle to parent effectively in these settings. Parenting
   interventions have robust evidence in many settings, however research
   supporting their use in CHEs is limited. We describe the development of
   a caregiver group intervention delivered by non-specialist staff to
   support child mental health in CHEs.MethodsA multi-phase, multi-method
   approach was employed: Phase 1: semi-structured interviews, analysed
   inductively, with specialist mental health staff in CHEs on needs and
   challenges in providing mental healthcare to children and caregivers.
   Phase 2: initial intervention development informed by Phase 1 and
   evidence-based theoretical approaches and psychological therapies. Phase
   3: expert review of draft intervention. Phase 4: semi-structured
   interviews, analysed inductively, with non-specialist staff in Papua New
   Guinea (PNG) to evaluate relevance, comprehensibility, and applicability
   of the intervention. Phase 5: cultural adaptation of the intervention
   prior to implementation in Northern Iraq. Different operational partners
   and research sites were employed at different phases of development to
   increase diversity of inputs and support the overall vision of an
   intervention that addressed common mental health difficulties and
   underlying factors to support children and caregivers across
   CHEs.ResultsMental health staff in CHEs identified a significant need
   for interventions to support parenting and address child mental health
   needs. A caregiver group intervention was developed consisting of six
   two-hour sessions, delivered weekly by non-specialist staff, and
   targeting parent knowledge and skills and parent stress. Expert
   consultation identified aspects of the intervention to emphasise or
   simplify, resulting in a refined intervention with ensured clinical
   quality. Non-specialist staff in PNG confirmed the intervention
   relevance to a vulnerable population in a humanitarian setting, and the
   manual was determined suitable for non-specialist facilitators. Mental
   health literacy, stigma and cultural views (masculinity, family privacy)
   were identified as challenges to address. A multi-stage method of
   cultural adaptation in Iraq ensured the clinical and cultural accuracy,
   relevance, and acceptability of the intervention. Initial adaptations to
   the language and metaphors used in the intervention resulted in high
   cultural appropriateness during pilot testing. Prioritising the
   recruitment and engagement of male caregivers is critical.ConclusionsA
   caregiver intervention to support child mental health in CHEs is
   available. It's development using multi-method, co-design processes will
   ensure its relevance and acceptability to target populations. Further
   research to evaluate the effectiveness and long-term effectiveness of
   the intervention is warranted.},

Abstract = {Introduction: The implementation of nautical sports, particularly in
   coastal areas, during the school stage is a growing phenomenon. It
   offers unique opportunities for students to develop the necessary
   competencies outlined in their physical education curriculum in an
   immersive manner, within a natural and inherently motivating
   environment. Material and methods: This study aims to delve deeper into
   this subject by conducting a systematic review of the utilization of
   water sports in formal education. To carry out this bibliographic
   search, the following keywords were employed: ``Nautical Activities{''},
   ``Nautical Sports{''}, ``Nautical Camps{''}, ``Formal Education{''},
   ``Children Education{''}, ``Primary School{''}, and ``Secondary
   School{''}. The Boolean operator ``and{''} was used to combine these
   keywords during the search conducted in databases such as Scopus,
   PubMed, Web of Science, and SPORTDiscus. The PRISMA Protocol was
   utilized for the search process, resulting in the selection and
   categorization of eight papers into the following thematic areas:
   Wellbeing, Physical and Mental Health, Education, and Management.
   Results: The primary findings of this review indicate that the inclusion
   of these programs within physical education classes enhances overall
   physical health, mental well-being, and personal development.
   Conclusions: The results demonstrate a positive impact on peer
   interaction and short-term improvement in self-confidence.},

Journal = {PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORTS},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {101},
Number = {1},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Findings from adoption, family, geographical, immigrant, molecular
   genetic, surname, and twin studies suggest genetic risk factors have a
   role in suicidal behavior. However, related mental health literacy
   (knowledge and beliefs) even of future health-care professionals who
   will be concerned with suicide lag behind this research progress. As no
   scale for assessing such beliefs is available, the 22-item Beliefs in
   the Inheritance of Risk Factors for Suicide Scale was constructed, its
   contents rated by experts in a validation survey and administered to
   samples of 70 medical and 165 psychology students. Medical students held
   stronger beliefs in the genetics of suicide than psychology students.
   Internal scale consistency and test-retest reliability were assessed as
   adequate. Factor analysis of the 22 items yielded a dominant first
   factor. Scores were positively related to knowledge about suicide
   (convergent validity) but for the most part unrelated to lay theories of
   suicide, political orientation, religiosity, and social desirability
   (discriminant validity). This novel scale shows potential for assessing
   individuals' beliefs about the genetics of suicide. Applications may
   include basic research, educational contexts, and evaluation of
   professional training.},

Title = {Adolescent mental health in sub-Saharan Africa: crisis? What crisis?
   Solution? What solution?},
Journal = {GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {Addressing adolescent mental health care across sub-Saharan Africa faces
   numerous challenges, including underfunded public health systems, a
   shortage of mental health professionals, barriers to access, and
   pervasive stigma. Untreated adolescents often experience worsening
   symptoms, academic and social difficulties, physical health risks, and
   engage in risky behaviours. Early detection and appropriate treatment of
   common mental health conditions can support adolescents in developing
   robust social and emotional foundations and enhancing their mental
   well-being. Ensuring adolescents receive the mental health care required
   for healthy development depends on collaborative, evidence-based
   solutions that consider the contextual challenges of sub-Saharan Africa.
   Innovative community-based solutions to mental health services may
   significantly improve accessibility and support adolescents close to
   their homes and schools. For example, co-creation and peer-delivered
   interventions with professional supervision may enhance uptake and
   reduce stigma. This short article adds to the current debate arguing for
   working with communities and implementing community mental health
   services for common mental health conditions. Sensitivity to
   community-specific challenges and building referral networks are crucial
   for effective care. Investing in these strategies, alongside increasing
   mental health literacy, could lead to affordable and significant
   interventions to address adolescent mental health.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In the aftermath of a global health pandemic, youth mental health is a
   public-health emergency. The acceleration of digital technologies,
   catalysed by COVID-19, has seen the growing significance of online
   support and social media for promoting health behaviours. This
   exploratory study utilised a participatory-action research (PAR) design
   to investigate adolescents' (N = 10; aged 16-18) perceptions and
   experiences of social media with respect to mental-wellbeing content.
   Data were collected using a focus-group method. Young people (YP) also
   evaluated digital resources adapted from the Super Skills for Life
   (SSL-A) intervention. Thematic analysis elicited three thematic
   categories: young people's relationship with social media, perceptions
   and experiences of support pathways, and cultivating mental-health and
   wellbeing provision for a digital generation. Findings revealed that YP
   were discerning digital citizens and willing to use technologies for
   support. Although exposure to social-media images and videos can convey
   social norms and shape normative perceptions of healthy wellbeing,
   mental-health literacy was a critical factor prompting change. Future
   co-production research is needed to design, develop, and evaluate
   digital resources adapted from evidence-based programmes to contribute
   to hybrid models of mental-wellbeing provision that can offer YP timely
   and appropriate support and a choice of delivery modalities.},

   Study},

Volume = {16},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to inadequate provision of
   mental health and addictions care, as services have been traditionally
   conceptualized to serve the needs of children or adults. Additionally,
   rural communities have been largely excluded from research investigating
   mental healthcare access and exhibit unique barriers that warrant
   targeted interventions. Finally, perspectives from the target population
   will be most important when understanding how to optimize adolescent
   mental health and addictions care. Therefore, the purpose of this study
   was to identify what adolescents in a rural town perceive as barriers to
   accessing mental health services. We conducted a cross-sectional survey
   study with high school students to generate ranked lists of the top
   perceived individual-level, community-level, and overall barriers. A
   total of 243 high school students responded to the survey. Perceived
   barriers were predominantly at the community level. Overall, the top
   barriers reported were a lack of awareness and education regarding
   mental health, resources, and the nature of treatment. Students who had
   previously accessed mental health services identified primary barriers
   related to mental health professionals, whereas students who had not
   accessed care reported fear and uncertainty as primary barriers.
   Modifiable community-level factors related to (1) mental health literacy
   and (2) mental healthcare professionals were identified by adolescents
   as the main perceived barriers to accessing mental health and addiction
   services in a rural town. The findings of this preliminary study should
   inform intervention strategies and further rigorous research for this
   traditionally underserved target population.},

Title = {Promotion of Wellbeing for Children of Parents With Mental Illness: A
   Model Protocol for Research and Intervention},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 6},
Abstract = {Background: The main objective of this project is to create a research
   and intervention model to promote large-scale implementation and
   evaluations of generic very brief interventions for children of parents
   with mental disorders (COPMI). Feasible interventions for COPMI aged
   0-18 years are highly needed, as this is a large high-risk group in
   society. Reducing behavioral problems and enhancing wellbeing for
   families with parents affected by any mental disorder are important
   preventive initiatives. One key prevention strategy is to reduce the
   risk and expression of psychopathology in children and to promote
   wellbeing. The present model protocol offers an intervention for
   children of parents with mental disorders internationally based on a
   model already implemented in the Netherlands and Norway.
   Methods: Participants will be parents receiving treatment in mental
   health services in participating countries and their minor children aged
   6-18 years. Participants should be randomized into an intervention group
   or control group. Data should be retrieved from electronic patient
   journals (demographics, DSM 5/ICD-10, SCID, MINI) as well as from
   assessment measures administered at baseline and follow-up, including
   the KIDSCREEN-27, Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ),
   Parents' Evaluations of Developmental Status (PEDS), Parenting Sense of
   Competence (PSOC), Resilience Scale for Adolescence (READ), Guilt and
   Shame Questionnaire for Adolescents of Parents with Mental Illness
   (GSQ-APMI), Mental Health Literacy Scale, and Parent-Child Communication
   Scale.
   Results: The hypothesis is that there will be improvements of child
   behavioral and emotional problems, and outcomes in the project will be
   reported in terms of parent's diagnosis, child behavioral and emotional
   problems, child wellbeing, family communication and functioning, as well
   as participants' satisfaction.
   Discussion: This multi-site international protocol will focus the
   attention of European scientific and policy makers toward COPMI. This
   young segment of the population is presently almost completely neglected
   in most European health policies, despite having a large burden of
   disability and being at risk of transgenerational transmission of
   psychopathology. We will further discuss the feasibility of a very brief
   intervention aiming at preventing mental disorders in young people.},

Title = {Suicide and Suicidal Ideation in Medical Students: A Systematic Review},
Journal = {CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 24},
Abstract = {The incidence of suicide and its ideation among medical students is
   increasingly recognized as a significant issue, influenced by the
   demanding nature of medical education and the various associated
   psychological stressors. This systematic review aims to elucidate the
   risk factors and prevalence of suicide and suicidal ideation within this
   group, with a focus on the implications for mental health interventions.
   Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
   Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, this review analyzed 11 studies
   selected from major databases such as Scopus-Elsevier, Google Scholar,
   PubMed, and others, focusing on publications between 2015 and 2023.
   Studies were predominantly observational and cross-sectional, examining
   suicide rates and suicidal ideation among medical students. The review
   found that medical students experience higher rates of suicide and
   suicidal ideation compared to the general population, with significant
   stressors including academic pressure, personal relationship challenges,
   and professional expectations. Notably, female respondents displayed a
   higher prevalence of suicidal ideation than males. Key warning signs
   identified include changes in mood or behavior and previous attempts of
   suicide. Despite varying findings regarding the role of medical training
   duration on suicidal ideation, all studies highlight the critical need
   for targeted mental health support. The findings underscore the urgent
   need for integrated mental health services and the incorporation of
   mental health education within the medical curriculum. A
   multidimensional approach involving enhancements to both curricular and
   support structures is crucial for mitigating the risk of suicide among
   medical students. Future research should focus on developing and
   evaluating interventions to reduce educational stress and promote
   psychological wellbeing in medical educational settings.},

Title = {The identification of young people's emotional distress: a study in
   primary care},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF GENERAL PRACTICE},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {59},
Number = {560},
Pages = {159-165},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background
   Primary care is a key step in young people's pathway to mental health
   care. Despite the high prevalence of mental disorder in this age group,
   little is known about the factors that determine the identification of
   young people's mental disorder in primary care.
   Aim
   To provide a detailed description of the factors associated with both
   `correct' and `excessive' identification of youth mental disorder in
   primary care.
   Design of the study
   Cross-sectional study.
   Setting
   Twenty-six randomly selected general practices in Victoria, Australia.
   Method
   Consecutive young people (16-24 years) were interviewed before their
   consultation, using a semi-structured interview. They completed
   Kessler's scale of emotional distress (K10). GPs completed a
   questionnaire after the consultation. Multinomial logistic regression
   was used to examine the factors associated with GP identification of
   mental disorder in those with high and low probability of disorder on
   the K10.
   Results
   Altogether, 450/501 (90\%) of approached young people participated;
   36.1\% (95\% confidence interval {[}CI] = 32.3 to 40.2\%) had high
   probability of mental disorder on the K10. Young people's perception
   that they had a mental illness was highly associated with GP
   identification (odds ratio {[}OR] = 62.6, 95\% CI = 22.8 to 172.0).
   Other significantly associated factors were: patient fears (OR = 2.4,
   95\% CI = 1.1 to 5.1), frequent consultations (OR = 3.0, 95\% CI = 1.0
   to 8.4), days out of role (OR = 2.7, 95\% CI = 1.2 to 5.7), and
   continuity of care (OR = 3.4, 95\% CI = 1.6 to 6.9). The latter two were
   also associated with `over-identification' of young people who had low
   probability of mental disorder. GP characteristics were not associated
   with identification.
   Conclusion
   These findings provide guidance for GPs in their clinical work and
   training. They should also inform the further development of mental
   health literacy programmes in the community.},

Abstract = {Objective. To assess the incidence of self-reported depression among
   pharmacy residents in Tennessee.
   Methods. A 50-question survey was distributed to pharmacy residency
   program directors across Tennessee. Using questions modified from the
   Major Depression Inventory scale, subjects were asked to identify
   personal signs or symptoms of depression. The researcher observed trends
   of depression and offered mental health education to participating
   programs.
   Results. Eighty-four residents were potentially exposed to the survey
   with 50 participants, yielding a 59\% response rate. Of the 50
   residents, 19 self-reported feeling depressed during residency. More
   concerning, 11 residents reported having suicidal thoughts.
   Additionally, 13 residents voiced they would benefit from mental health
   resources.
   Conclusion. Self-reported depression among pharmacy residents is not
   uncommon. Defining mental health benefit resources at the beginning of
   residency would be beneficial.},

Title = {Paramedicine students' experiences on placement: preparedness for the
   emotional impacts of witnessing trauma},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Paramedicine is a psychologically high-risk profession, with workers
   routinely exposed to fatalities and severe medical and emotional trauma.
   During their studies, paramedicine students undergo practical training
   with ambulance crews. Without experience, and often with limited
   emotional preparation, students are exposed to many of the same graphic
   and traumatic situations as working professionals. This qualitative
   social constructionist study explored the emotional impacts experienced
   during placement and students' emotional preparedness to cope with the
   challenges of placement. Findings revealed a range of significant
   emotional impacts reported by the participants. Initial anxiety was
   found to intensify the response to distressing incidents involving
   fatalities, severe injuries, domestic violence, and suicide-related
   incidents. In some cases, students reported ongoing, lingering emotional
   effects. Most students also felt that they were inadequately prepared
   for the emotional challenges of placement. A common recommendation among
   the participants was the inclusion of formal mental health education and
   resilience training prior to placement. Given the prior absence of
   research exploring the lived experiences of paramedic students on
   placement, the current findings add important depth and a student
   perspective. The implications of this research highlight an urgent need
   for a greater focus on students' emotional preparedness prior to
   placement training.},

Abstract = {Objective: The objective of this Clinical Update is to review the
   principles, structures, processes, and outcomes of collaborative mental
   health care in the pediatric primary care setting.Method: A search of
   the literature on this topic from 2001was conducted initially in 2016,
   yielding 2,279 English-language citations. These citations were
   supplemented by references suggested by topic experts and identified
   through Web searches, increasing the yield to 2,467 total citations, of
   which 1,962 were unduplicated. After sequential review by Update authors
   at title/abstract and then full-text levels, the citations were winnowed
   to 219 based on topic relevance. A follow-up search from 2016 was
   conducted in 2021, yielding 2 additional citations based on
   nonduplication from initial search and topic relevance.Results: The
   collaborative care approach, arising in the 1990s and gaining momentum
   in the 2000s, aims to extend behavioral health care to the primary care
   setting. The goal of collaborative care is to conserve the sparse
   specialty care workforce for severe and complex psychiatric disorders
   through shifting certain specialty mental health tasks (eg, assessment;
   patient self-management; brief psychosocial intervention; basic
   psychopharmacology; care coordination) to primary care. Collaborative
   care can be delivered on a spectrum ranging from coordinated to
   co-located to integrated care. Although each of these models has some
   empirical support, integrated care-a multidisciplinary team-based
   approach-has the strongest evidence base in improving clinical outcomes
   and patient satisfaction while constraining costs. Challenges to
   integrated care implementation include insufficient mental health
   education and insufficient specialist consultative and care coordination
   support for primary care practitioners; space, time, and reimbursement
   constraints in the primary care setting; discomfort among primary care
   practitioners in assuming mental health tasks previously undertaken by
   spe-cialists; and continuing need for and unavailability of ongoing
   specialty mental health care for severe and complex cases. Essential
   supporting activities for effective collaborative care include patient
   and family engagement, professional education and training,
   evaluation/demonstration of impact, fiscal sustainability, and advocacy
   for model dissemination. Conclusion: Health professionals who are
   educated in the collaborative care approach can improve access to and
   quality of behavioral health care for children and adolescents with
   behavioral health needs.},

Title = {Comparative Effectiveness of Mental Health Simulation Techniques in
   Nursing Education: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH NURSING},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {34},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Simulation-based training in mental health is increasingly recognised as
   an effective tool within nursing education. This systematic review and
   meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of various simulation
   modalities, including standardised participants (SPs), role-plays,
   virtual reality (VR), mannequins and voice simulations, in improving
   educational outcomes for nursing students. A comprehensive literature
   search was conducted to identify studies evaluating the impact of mental
   health simulation on nursing education. Data from 62 studies were
   extracted and analysed. The primary outcomes included knowledge,
   confidence, self-efficacy, competence and anxiety. Meta-analyses
   assessed both pretest/posttest changes and comparisons between
   simulation and control groups. Pretest/posttest analyses revealed
   significant improvements across multiple modalities: SPs enhanced
   knowledge (SMD = 1.26), confidence (SMD = 1.20), self-efficacy (SMD =
   0.94), attitude (SMD = 0.22), competence (SMD = 2.30) and anxiety
   reduction (SMD = -0.88). Role-plays demonstrated gains in knowledge (SMD
   = 0.87), confidence (SMD = 1.24), self-efficacy (SMD = 0.74), attitude
   (SMD = 0.53), competence (SMD = 0.82) and reduced anxiety (SMD = -0.73).
   VR improved knowledge (SMD = 0.86), self-efficacy (SMD = 0.75) and
   competence (SMD = 0.69). Mannequins showed no significant changes in
   knowledge or competence. Voice simulations improved knowledge (SMD =
   0.96). Comparisons with control groups indicated that SPs significantly
   increased knowledge (SMD = 1.31), competence (SMD = 1.51) and reduced
   anxiety (SMD = -2.01). Role-plays enhanced knowledge (SMD = 1.03)
   compared with inactive controls; VR increased knowledge (SMD = 0.86)
   compared with controls. Mannequins showed no significant differences,
   and voice simulations lacked sufficient data for comprehensive analysis.
   This meta-analysis underscores the value of simulation-based training in
   mental health nursing education, with SPs proving particularly effective
   in enhancing clinical preparedness. Role-plays, VR and voice simulations
   offer supplementary benefits but may require integration with more
   interactive methods for optimal impact. Future research should
   prioritise high-quality randomised controlled trials, standardised
   simulation protocols and long-term follow-up to clarify the sustained
   effects of simulation training on clinical practice.},

Journal = {MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Autism, a developmental disorder affecting social and communication
   skills, differs from most the mental handicap in showing a
   characteristic pattern of poor, intact, and even superior cognitive
   abilities. This study aims to solve the mismatch of the teaching content
   and mental health education for autistic children. Inspired by
   artificial intelligence, an improved neural network matrix factorization
   (NeuMF) model is designed based on the theory of collaborative
   filtering, and time data is added to improve the NeuMF by using the
   K-means clustering algorithm. Several evaluation indexes such as root
   mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are selected to
   assess the performance of the proposed model. Results show that RMSE and
   MAE of the improved NeuMF model are 1.251 and 0.625, respectively, which
   are better than collaborative filtering and traditional neural network
   factorization models. Moreover, the proposed model is used to recommend
   the activities of physical education (PE) for developing the
   intelligence of autistic children. This proves that the optimized model
   has better performance and can be used to recommend online courses for
   autistic users. This dynamic personalized curriculum recommendations
   model can help autistic children recover in a short time.},

Title = {Associations between teacher-student relationship and externalizing
   problem behaviors among Chinese rural adolescent},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Month = {NOV 2},
Abstract = {The primary objective of this study is to present a fresh perspective on
   the correlation between teacher-student relationships and externalizing
   problem behaviors among adolescents. While previous research has
   examined this connection, there is still an insufficient understanding
   of the underlying mechanisms. Moreover, the crucial role of peer
   relationships, mental health, and parental knowledge has been
   overlooked. In this study, a total of 6,919 Chinese rural adolescents
   aged 13-19 years participated by completing an anonymous self-report
   questionnaire. The results show that: (1) teacher-student relationship
   has a protective effect against the development of externalizing problem
   behaviors; (2) peer relationship and mental health both have a mediating
   role in the relationship between teacher-student relationship and
   externalizing problem behaviors; (3) teacher-student relationship can
   indirectly affect externalizing problem behaviors through the chain
   mediation of peer relationship and mental health; (4) parental knowledge
   plays a moderating role between the teacher-student relationship and
   externalizing problem behaviors. As the level of parental knowledge
   increases among rural adolescents, the impact of the teacher-student
   relationship on externalizing problem behaviors becomes more pronounced;
   and (5) the impact of teacher-student relationship on externalizing
   problem behaviors has no significant gender differences. Given the
   study's empirical outcomes, we discuss potential explanations and
   advocate for a comprehensive pedagogical approach to mitigate rural
   adolescent externalizing behaviors. This entails nurturing
   teacher-student relations, fostering inclusive peer environments,
   emphasizing mental health literacy, and synergizing with caregivers for
   a holistic home-school intervention.},

Journal = {CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {114},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The aim of this umbrella review is to summarize evidence on factors that
   influence help-seeking and service utilization for professional mental
   healthcare among young people ages 0-30. The CINAHL, Cochrane,
   Epistemonikos, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science databases
   were searched in December 2023 for systematic reviews in English. The
   search yielded 26 eligible reviews, all of which are medium or high
   quality. Primary study overlap was rare. Using an established framework,
   we organize intrapersonal (n = 37), interpersonal (n = 14),
   institutional (n = 9), community (n = 7), and public policy (n = 6)
   factors. The most frequently reviewed factor at each level is trust of
   professionals (intrapersonal), close others' support for treatment
   (interpersonal), cost (institutional), availability (community), and
   insurance (public policy). Stigma is widely referenced (18 reviews) and
   classified as multi-dimensional. Narrative synthesis reveals
   populationspecific variability (e.g., rural, racial/ethnic minority,
   refugees, immigrants) in the importance of many factors. To develop
   interventions and healthcare systems sensitive to young people's needs,
   we recommend promoting stigma-reduction campaigns, and targeting
   trustworthiness, affordability, anonymity, accessibility, and mental
   health literacy. Identifying commonalities and differences across
   populations and contexts assists in the design of nuanced and efficient
   treatment delivery systems for young people, who are at a critical time
   for their mental health.},

Abstract = {The training undergraduate nursing students receive, both in terms of
   theoretical input and clinical practice, may help to instil a less
   stigmatising perception of mental health. To analyse the perceived
   evolution of attitudes and expected behaviours, a longitudinal repeated
   measures study was conducted in a population of student nurses during
   their undergraduate mental health education. The Mental Illness:
   Clinicians' Attitudes Scale, a Scale for measuring attitudes to the
   mentally ill among future Health workers, and the Reported and Intended
   Behaviour Scale were completed. A mixed linear model was used to assess
   the effect of each factor in the questionnaires before and after the
   various stages of the students' training in mental health. The overall
   effect of each factor was assessed by testing the interaction between
   factor and group, both with and without adjustment with the Social
   Desirability Scale. The results showed that the clinical practice stage,
   due to the proximity to care for people with mental health problems,
   improves attitudes and behaviours towards mental health in students who
   have not had mental health problems, and also in younger students. In
   conclusion, integrated, holistic training during the period of clinical
   practice was associated with positive changes in the attitudes and
   intended behaviour.},

Title = {Harmonizing early intervention strategies: scoping review of clinical
   high risk for psychosis and borderline personality disorder},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Month = {JUN 20},
Abstract = {Aims: To map studies assessing both clinical high risk for psychosis
   (CHR-P) and borderline personality disorder (BPD) in clinical samples,
   focusing on clinical/research/preventive paradigms and proposing
   informed research recommendations. Methods: We conducted a
   PRISMA-ScR/JBI-compliant scoping review (protocol: https://osf.io/8mz7a)
   of primary research studies (cross-sectional/longitudinal designs) using
   valid measures/criteria to assess CHR-P and BPD (threshold/subthreshold)
   in clinical samples, reporting on CHR-P/psychotic symptoms and
   personality disorder(s) in the title/abstract/keywords, identified in
   Web of Science/PubMed/(EBSCO)PsycINFO until 23/08/2023. Results: 33
   studies were included and categorized into four themes reflecting their
   respective clinical/research/preventive paradigm: (i) BPD as a
   comorbidity in CHR-P youth (k = 20), emphasizing early detection and
   intervention in psychosis; (ii) attenuated psychosis syndrome (APS) as a
   comorbidity among BPD inpatients (k = 2), with a focus on hospitalized
   adolescents/young adults admitted for non-psychotic mental disorders;
   (iii) mixed samples (k = 7), including descriptions of early
   intervention services and referral pathways; (iv) transdiagnostic
   approaches (k = 4) highlighting ``clinical high at risk mental state{''}
   (CHARMS) criteria to identify a pluripotent risk state for severe mental
   disorders. Conclusion: The scoping review reveals diverse approaches to
   clinical care for CHR-P and BPD, with no unified treatment strategies.
   Recommendations for future research should focus on: (i) exploring
   referral pathways across early intervention clinics to promote timely
   intervention; (ii) enhancing early detection strategies in innovative
   settings such as emergency departments; (iii) improving mental health
   literacy to facilitate help-seeking behaviors; (iv) analysing comorbid
   disorders as complex systems to better understand and target early
   psychopathology; (v) investigating prospective risk for BPD; (vi)
   developing transdiagnostic interventions; (vii) engaging youth with
   lived experience of comorbidity to gain insight on their subjective
   experience; (viii) understanding caregiver burden to craft
   family-focused interventions; (ix) expanding research in
   underrepresented regions such as Africa and Asia, and; (x) evaluating
   the cost-effectiveness of early interventions to determine scalability
   across different countries.},

Journal = {BMC PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},

Month = {JUN 30},
Abstract = {BackgroundThe Mental Health Support Scale for Adolescents (MHSSA) is a
   criterion-referenced measure of adolescents' supportive intentions
   towards peers with mental health problems, which was developed for use
   in evaluations of adolescent mental health interventions, such as the
   teen Mental Health First Aid (tMHFA) program. The present study aimed to
   examine the validity and reliability of the MHSSA.MethodsA sample of
   3092 school students (Mean \& PLUSMN; SD: 15.9 \& PLUSMN; 0.4 years old)
   and 65 tMHFA Instructors (the adult group with known expertise in tMHFA)
   completed the 12 items of the MHSSA. A sub-sample of 1201 students
   repeated the scale after a 3-4-week interval. Item concordance rates
   with the tMHFA Action Plan across helpful and harmful intentions scales
   were calculated. Scale reliabilities were assessed using agreement
   coefficients from a single test administration and test-retest
   reliability measured by intraclass correlation coefficients. The mean
   differences of MHSSA scores of students and Instructors were compared
   using independent samples t-tests, while convergent validity was tested
   via correlations of the scale with validated measures of confidence in
   providing help, social distance and personal stigma.ResultsThe average
   score of Instructors was significantly higher than that of students. The
   scale was positively associated with confidence in providing help,
   whilst negatively associated with social distance and dimensions of
   personal stigma. All scales of MHSSA had high agreement coefficients
   (all > 0.80) and fair to good test-retest reliability over 3-4
   weeks.ConclusionsThe MHSSA shows evidence of validity and reliability
   for use among adolescents for evaluating the quality of intentions to
   help peers with mental health problems.},

Abstract = {Few studies have dealt with parents search for professional help, or the
   factors related to consultation by sectors of intervention (health,
   mental health, education). In response to that gap, this study seeks to
   document which professionals are consulted during a year in relation
   with child education or behaviour and what individual, family and social
   factors are related to such support. The data result from a telephone
   survey of a representative, weighted sample of 2326 Quebec mothers of
   children between the ages of 6 months and 8 years of age. About one
   mother in three stated that she had consulted at least one professional
   about parenting during the year. Logistic regression analysis shows that
   the mothers who consult most frequently do so concerning an older boy
   who is experiencing emotional or hyperactive problems. Compared to
   mothers who do not consult professionals, the mothers who do consult
   display various psychosocial issues, including single parenting, a weak
   sense of parental skills, and increased parental stress; they also
   report more frequent recourse to coercive conduct with their child. Path
   analyses, for their part, reveal that the mother's characteristics are
   different depending on whether they have consulted a health
   professional, a mental health or education professional. The results
   raise many issues about normalization of the search for help by parents,
   about the training of professionals and their ability to respond to the
   needs of the mothers who consult them.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:There is an urgent need to advance mental
   health (MH) education and/or training in pediatric residency programs,
   yet no consensus on how to achieve this. We created an operational
   framework from ideas provided by a diverse group of stakeholders on how
   to advance MH education.METHODS:Concept-mapping methodology was used,
   which involves brainstorming ideas by completing a focus prompt, sorting
   ideas into groups, and rating them for importance and feasibility.
   Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis grouped ideas
   into clusters. Average importance and feasibility were calculated for
   each statement and cluster and compared statistically in each cluster
   and between subgroups.RESULTS:Ninety-nine ideas were generated. Sorted
   ideas yielded a 7-cluster concept map: (1) modalities for MH training,
   (2) prioritization of MH, (3) systems-based practice, (4) self-awareness
   and/or relationship building, (5) training in clinical assessment of
   patients, (6) training in treatment, and (7) diagnosis-specific skills.
   Two hundred and sixteen participants rated ideas for importance and 209
   for feasibility. Four clusters had a statistically significant
   difference between their importance and feasibility ratings (P < .001).
   Suburban and rural area respondents (versus urban) rated clusters higher
   in importance and feasibility (P < .004), trainees rated all clusters
   higher in feasibility than practicing clinicians, and MH professionals
   rated prioritization of MH higher in feasibility (3.42 vs 2.98; P <
   .001).CONCLUSIONS:This comprehensive set of ideas, especially those
   rated highly in both importance and feasibility, should inform
   curricular and policy initiatives. Differences between importance and
   feasibility may explain why there has been little progress in this
   field.},

Title = {Effectiveness of Neurofeedback-Assisted and Conventional 6-Week
   Web-Based Mindfulness Interventions on Mental Health of Chinese Nursing
   Students: Randomized Controlled Trial},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2025},

Abstract = {Background: Nursing students experience disproportionately high rates of
   mental health challenges, underscoring the urgent need for innovative,
   scalable interventions. Web-based mindfulness programs, and more
   recently, neurofeedback-enhanced approaches, present potentially
   promising avenues for addressing this critical issue. Objective: This
   study aimed to explore the effectiveness of the neurofeedback-assisted
   online mindfulness intervention (NAOM) and the conventional online
   mindfulness intervention (COM) in reducing mental health symptoms among
   Chinese nursing students. Methods: A 3-armed randomized controlled trial
   was conducted among 147 nursing students in Beijing, China, using a
   6-week web-based mindfulness program. Participants received NAOM, COM,
   or general mental health education across 6 weeks. Electroencephalogram
   and validated tools such as the Patient Health Questionnaire and the
   Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire were used to primarily assess
   symptoms of depression and anxiety at baseline, immediately after the
   intervention, and at 1 and 3 months after the intervention. Generalized
   estimating equations were used to evaluate the effects of intervention
   and time. Results: A total of 155 participants enrolled in the study,
   and 147 finished all assessments. Significant reductions in the symptoms
   of depression, anxiety, and fatigue were observed in the NAOM (mean
   difference {[}MD]=-3.330, Cohen d=0.926, P<.001; MD=-3.468, Cohen
   d=1.091, P<.001; MD=-2.620, Cohen d=0.743, P<.001, respectively) and the
   COM (MD=-1.875, Cohen d=0.490, P=.03; MD=-1.750, Cohen d=0.486, P=.02;
   MD=-2.229, Cohen d=0.629, P=.01, respectively) groups compared with the
   control group at postintervention assessment. Moreover, the NAOM group
   showed significantly better effects than the COM group in alleviating
   depressive symptoms (MD=-1.455; Cohen d=0.492; P=.04) and anxiety
   symptoms (MD=-1.718; Cohen d=0.670; P=.04) and improving the level of
   mindfulness (MD=-3.765; Cohen d=1.245; P<.001) at the postintervention
   assessment. However, no significant difference except for the anxiety
   symptoms was observed across the 3 groups at the 1-and 3-month
   follow-ups. Conclusions: This 6-week web-based mindfulness intervention,
   both conventional and neurofeedback-assisted, effectively alleviated
   mental health problems in the short term among nursing students. The
   addition of neurofeedback demonstrated greater short-term benefits;
   however, but these effects were not sustained over the long term. Future
   research should focus on long-term interventions using a more robust
   methodological approach.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the relationship between stress and depression
   among postgraduate students, with a focus on the mediating role of
   research self-efficacy and the moderating role of growth mindset. A
   questionnaire survey was conducted among 2278 graduate students
   nationwide, utilizing the Mindset Scale, Depression-Anxiety-Stress
   Scale, and Research Self-Efficacy Scale. Data were analyzed using SPSS
   27.0 and AMOS 24.0. The results indicate the following: (1) Stress has a
   significant positive relationship with depression, while stress is
   negatively related to research self-efficacy, and research self-efficacy
   is negatively related to depression. (2) Research self-efficacy
   partially mediates the relationship between stress and depression,
   accounting for 35.6\% of the total effect. (3) Growth mindset moderates
   both the relationship between stress and research self-efficacy and the
   relationship between research self-efficacy and depression. These
   findings reveal the mechanisms through which stress affects depression
   among graduate students, underscore the importance of mental health
   education, and provide scientific evidence for universities and
   educational institutions to design targeted prevention and intervention
   measures.},

Abstract = {Nearly 44 million Americans are affected by mental illness every year.
   Many individuals, however, are not diagnosed and/or do not receive
   treatment. The present manuscript reviews the incidence of mental
   illness, the continuum from mental wellness to mental illness, and the
   role of the pharmacy staff in helping individuals manage different
   mental health needs. In particular, there is discussion of stigma of
   mental illness that those with mental health needs experience by those
   around them including health professionals such as pharmacy staff. One
   way to resolve such stigma is through training such as Mental Health
   First Aid (MHFA). The paper reviews key aspects of MHFA, the evidence
   supporting MHFA, and how MHFA relates specifically to pharmacy practice
   and services. A conceptual framework for MHFA and its relationship to
   individual factors, attitudes, behaviors, and outcomes. Lastly, a
   discussion is presented that briefly compares MHFA to other similar
   approaches to helping those in mental health crises, the limits of what
   is known about MHFA, and what future research might explore to better
   understand the outcomes of pharmacy staff providing mental health
   education, support, and referral to care.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveThe objective is to explore the barriers and facilitators
   experienced by mental health care professionals in providing mental
   health services to Omani children and adolescents.MethodsA qualitative
   descriptive study with semi-structured face-to-face interviews was
   conducted on a purposive sample of sixteen mental health professionals
   from a tertiary care psychiatric hospital in Oman. Audio recordings were
   transcribed verbatim, and the anonymized transcripts were processed with
   Delve Tool, a qualitative data analysis software that streamlines
   thematic analysis.ResultsBarriers to access mental health services were-
   institutional system and policy limitations; specialized workforce
   deficiency; lack of systemic interagency coordination; logistical
   barriers, language barriers, resistance to treatment, inefficient
   facility design, and cultural stigma. Facilitators were - integrated
   team-based care; telemedicine and public awareness campaigns; existing
   expertise and integrated services model.ConclusionThis study highlights
   the urgent need for action in ways to expand mental health education,
   and breakdown the stigma that often prevents people from seeking help.
   By integrating care models and ensuring that professionals receive
   ongoing training, the existing gaps can be closed and mental health
   services can be made more effective.},

Abstract = {Children of parents with a mental illness are at significant risk of
   developing a mental illness. This risk may be reduced if appropriate
   interventions are provided that include information and knowledge about
   mental illness. While there are some interventions for children of
   parents with a mental illness, research is lacking about the type of
   mental health information children need and why they need that
   knowledge. This study presents the perspectives of a purposive sample of
   international research experts in the field of parental mental illness
   about the kind of mental health literacy information children with
   parents with a mental illness need. Twenty-three participants completed
   a self-constructed short answer questionnaire about the knowledge needs
   of children of parents with a mental illness. The qualitative data
   indicates that `identifying information', `making sense of parents
   behaviour', `coping better' and `respecting safety' are key knowledge
   needs of children. Given the views presented, these findings suggest
   that health care professionals should advocate for policies that support
   individual-, peer-, and family-focused programs driven by strong
   evaluation and rigorous research. If this is done, children of parents
   with mental illness may experience `myth busting' of incorrect
   information about mental illness.},

Abstract = {Youth mental health crises in the USA increased dramatically during the
   COVID-19 pandemic. Schools are uniquely positioned to address the
   growing mental health needs of youth by connecting them with mental
   health services; however, they are often under-resourced to provide
   these services. This study used community resource mapping to identify
   the existence, distribution, and types of youth mental health crisis
   services available in the Boston area. Semi-structured interviews with
   school and community providers were conducted to examine the
   facilitators and barriers to youth mental health crisis service access.
   Findings show that while 23 programs were identified in Boston, there
   were gaps in terms of service availability by neighborhood, language
   accessibility, and type of crisis services provided. Thematic analysis
   of the qualitative interviews identified attitudinal and structural
   barriers to service utilization, including family stigma related to
   mental health diagnosis and services, resource accessibility and
   COVID-19 impacts, and the need for additional training and support for
   families and school-based staff. Findings demonstrate the need for
   cross-discipline school and community collaboration and culturally
   responsive mental health education and promotion.},

Title = {Feasibility and Acceptability of a Family-Based Telehealth Intervention
   for Families Impacted by the Child Welfare System: Formative Mixed
   Methods Evaluation},
Journal = {JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {8},
Abstract = {Background: Despite elevated rates of trauma exposure, substance misuse,
   mental health problems, and suicide, systems-impacted teens and their
   caregivers have limited access to empirically supported behavioral
   health services. Family-based interventions are the most effective for
   improving mental health, education, substance use, and delinquency
   outcomes, yet the familial and placement disruption that occurs during
   child welfare involvement can interfere with the delivery of
   family-based interventions.
   Objective: To address this gap in access to services, we adapted an
   in-person, empirically supported, family-based affect management
   intervention using a trauma-informed lens to be delivered via telehealth
   to families impacted by the child welfare system (Family Telehealth
   Project). We describe the intervention adaptation process and an open
   trial to evaluate its feasibility, acceptability, and impact.
   Methods: Adaptations to the in-person, family-based affect management
   intervention were conducted iteratively with input from youth,
   caregivers, and systems partners. Through focus groups and collaborative
   meetings with systems partners, a caregiver-only version of the
   intervention was also developed. An open trial of the intervention was
   conducted to assess family perspectives of its acceptability and
   feasibility and inform further refinements prior to a larger-scale
   evaluation. Participants included English-speaking families involved in
   the child welfare system in the past 12 months with teens (aged 12-18
   years). Caregivers were eligible to participate either individually
   (caregivers of origin, kinship caregivers, or foster parents; n=7) or
   with their teen (caregiver of origin only; n=6 dyads). Participants
   completed session feedback forms and surveys at pretreatment,
   posttreatment, and 3-month posttreatment time points. Qualitative exit
   interviews were conducted with a subset of participants (12/19, 63\%) to
   further understand their experiences with the intervention.
   Results: Session attendance was high, and both caregivers and teens
   reported high acceptability of clinicians and sessions on feedback
   forms. Families were comfortable with video technology, with very few
   (<5\%) sessions having reported technology problems. Thematic analysis
   of exit interview transcripts indicated that families used effective
   communication and affect management skills taught during the
   intervention. Regarding challenges and barriers, some caregiver-only
   participants expressed a desire to have their teen also participate in
   the intervention. All interview participants reported that they would
   recommend the intervention to others and perceptions of the intervention
   were overwhelmingly positive. Quantitative surveys revealed differential
   responses to the intervention regarding affect management and
   communication.
   Conclusions: An open trial of the Family Telehealth Project, a
   skills-based telehealth intervention for families impacted by the child
   welfare system, suggests high levels of intervention feasibility and
   acceptability. Participants noted improvements in areas often hindered
   by the impacts of trauma and family separation: communication and affect
   management. Perceptions of the intervention were positive overall for
   both teens and caregivers. The Family Telehealth Project shows promise
   in addressing the gaps in behavioral health access for systems-impacted
   families.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Depression affects around 5\% of adolescents and its
   identification and management is an important part of front-line
   professionals' roles. There are few validated measures of knowledge and
   skills in this area. We describe a multiple-choice question set to test
   nurses' depression knowledge and vignettes to examine case recognition
   skills. METHODS: A 24-item knowledge test and 12 vignettes were
   developed based on relevant literature and expert panel review. Three
   rounds of panel review assessed face and content validity and expert
   agreement of vignette depression status. The measures were piloted with
   26 school nurses. Following amendments, administered to 146 school
   nurses. A depression attitude scale was used concurrently so that
   associations among knowledge, attitudes, and condition recognition could
   be explored. RESULTS: Readability for the knowledge test and vignettes
   was satisfactory. Item difficulty and discrimination indices for most
   knowledge questions were acceptable; overall, participants scored 50\%
   correctly, with less than 5\% unanswered. The panel reached 89\%
   agreement about vignette depression status, and nurse participants'
   judgments of the vignettes achieved 65\% sensitivity and 47\%
   specificity. CONCLUSION: The study produced psychometrically tested
   instruments for measuring depression recognition and knowledge. There
   was evidence for content validity, and limited evidence of convergent
   validity from associations among measures. Some of the items may be
   modified, and a smaller set of vignettes having the best expert
   agreement may be useful in future research.},

Title = {``Me{''} Versus ``Them{''}: How Mental Illness Stigma Influences
   Adolescent Help-Seeking Behaviors for Oneself and Recommendations for
   Peers},
Journal = {STIGMA AND HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {7},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Mental illness stigma is a significant barrier to utilizing mental
   health services for young populations. Few studies have evaluated how
   specific stigma dimensions relate to help-seeking and recommendations
   among adolescents. We examined how the stigma dimensions of labeling,
   stereotypes, and separation/discrimination influenced self-reported
   help-seeking behaviors of adolescents and recommendations for
   hypothetical peers with a mental health problem. Longitudinal data (four
   assessments) from a study evaluating the effectiveness of three
   antistigma interventions (curriculum, contact, materials, vs. control)
   among adolescents were analyzed (n = 396). Help-seeking outcomes
   comprised services in formal (e.g., doctor), informal (e.g., friend), or
   school-based (e.g., school counselor) settings. Generalized estimating
   equations tested associations of labeling, stereotypes, and
   separation/discrimination on help-seeking for a personal problem and
   recommendations for vignette characters described as having bipolar
   depression or social anxiety disorder. Adolescents were more likely to
   make help-seeking recommendations for peers with mental health problems
   than they were to seek help for a problem of their own. Labeling was a
   strong predictor of self-reported help-seeking and recommendations.
   Mental health literacy, an indicator for low negative stereotypes, was
   related to increased recommendations but not self-reported help-seeking.
   Positive stigma action and awareness-high cognizance of stigma and how
   to engage in proactive behaviors toward treating and destigmatizing
   mental illness-increased help-seeking in formal and informal settings
   for oneself. Finally, separation/discrimination did not prevent
   self-reported help-seeking, but it did increase peer recommendations in
   certain settings. Stigma did not always influence or interfere with
   help-seeking in the same way when the help-seeker was oneself versus a
   peer.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to compare British, British Pakistani and Native
   Pakistani (from Pakistan) medical students' beliefs about the
   manifestation, causes and cures of schizophrenia, prior to any
   psychiatric training. A total of 305 participants completed a
   questionnaire on general beliefs about people with schizophrenia, causal
   explanations concerning the aetiology of schizophrenia and the role of
   hospitals and society in treating people with schizophrenia. It was
   predicted that compared with the British and British Pakistanis, the
   Pakistanis would have more negative beliefs and attitudes, considering
   people with schizophrenia to be more dangerous and unpredictable; they
   were also expected to use more superstitious beliefs to explain the
   cause of schizophrenia and its symptoms; as well as believe more in
   seeking help from God and faith healers. There was strong evidence to
   suggest that Pakistanis possessed more negative beliefs and attitudes
   about people with schizophrenia, but there was no evidence to indicate
   that Pakistanis believed more in superstitious causal explanations.
   Pakistanis were more likely to consider seeking help from faith healers,
   but not God, compared with British Pakistanis and the British. Results
   confirm previous European-Asian difference in the understanding of the
   cause, manifestation and cure of schizophrenia. The impact of
   traditional and Western cultural influences on British Pakistanis is
   considered. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Adolescents as co-designers: adapting human-centered design to develop
   school-based mental health strategies in northern Ghana},
Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 11},
Abstract = {Background Adolescents in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) face
   significant mental health challenges, yet their perspectives are often
   underrepresented in the design of preventive strategies. Co-design
   approaches, such as human-centered design (HCD), offer a promising way
   to tailor interventions and implementation strategies to adolescents'
   needs and local context. In LMICs, these methods require careful
   adaptation to address resource constraints, limited design literacy, and
   cultural norms. This study documents how HCD was adapted to engage
   adolescents in northern Ghana as co-designers of school-based mental
   health preventive strategies. Methods Guided by the first two phases of
   HCD, we conducted two workshops with 24 students from 12 public senior
   high schools in Tamale, Ghana. Workshop 1 (Inspiration) used structured,
   case-based discussions informed by the Consolidated Framework for
   Implementation Research (CFIR) to explore adolescents' perspectives on
   mental health. Workshop 2 (Ideation) used interactive choice-based
   activities to elicit youth-generated strategies. To align with cognitive
   and sociocultural factors, we incorporated scaffolded facilitation,
   hands-on activities, and peer-led engagement. Qualitative data from
   facilitator notes, artifacts, and audio-confirmed summaries were
   synthesized using structured rapid qualitative analysis. Results
   Adolescents identified key mental health concerns, including stigma,
   peer and family influences, and fears about confidentiality.
   Gender-specific discussions revealed culturally rooted concerns, such as
   peer pressure and substance use among boys and limited support-seeking
   among girls. Adolescents prioritized five school strategies: teacher
   training, curricular integration, mentorship programs, activities that
   promote positive thinking and mindfulness, and entertainment-based
   mental health education. Youth demonstrated a conceptual shift from
   viewing mental health as an individual problem to a shared
   responsibility across schools and communities. Formation of an
   Adolescent Advisory Board reflected youth interest in sustained
   leadership and co-design. Conclusions Contextualized co-design methods
   can meaningfully engage adolescents in LMIC settings and support the
   development of culturally grounded, feasible, and youth-prioritized
   mental health strategies. Structured facilitation enhances both the
   inclusivity and authenticity of adolescent engagement. This study
   contributes to implementation science by presenting a replicable
   co-design framework with policy relevance and providing a foundation for
   multilevel intervention development in resource-constrained educational
   systems.},

Title = {The psychosocial impacts of cybervictimisation and barriers to seeking
   social support: Young people's perspectives},
Journal = {CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {111},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The negative impact of cyberbullying on the mental health of victims is
   well established. However, qualitative research related to the mental
   health impacts of cybervictimisation and how these are experienced by
   young people is scarce. In particular, little is known about young
   people's perceptions of the association between cyberbullying and
   suicidal behaviours. This paper reports findings on the mental health
   impacts of cyberbullying, and barriers to seeking social support, from
   eleven focus groups with 64 young people aged fourteen to seventeen
   (53\% female), across four secondary schools. Thematic analysis
   identified two central themes: The Psychological Nature of Cyberbullying
   (sub-themes include Trapped by the Omni-Presence of Cyber Technology;
   Negative Overthinking; The Impacts of Negative Overthinking on Young
   People's Lives; and Suicide as a Means of Escape) and Barriers to
   Help-Seeking (including sub-themes Needing Help Regarded as Sign of
   Weakness; Young People Unable to Identify and Express Feelings; Lack of
   Confidence in Parents Ability to Provide Support; and Inappropriate
   School Intervention). Cyberbullying was described as more psychological
   in nature and impact than traditional bullying with increased
   deleterious effect on the mental health and wellbeing of victims.
   Victims experience rumination and worry fuelled by the omni-present,
   pervasive, and permanent nature of cyber interactions. Young people's
   inability to seek support maintains and exacerbates victims' distress.
   Participants perceived suicide as a viable escape route for young
   victims defeated and entrapped by cybervictimisation and their own
   negative thoughts. Interventions should address emotional competence and
   mental health literacy in young people, as well as empowering support
   networks including parents, peers, and school personnel, to foster an
   environment that promotes help-seeking.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to determine the efficacy of the
   Peer Education Project (PEP), a school-based, peer-led intervention
   designed to support secondary school students to develop the skills and
   knowledge they need to safeguard their mental health and that of their
   peers. Design/methodology/approach Six schools from across England and
   the Channel Islands took part in an evaluation of the PEP across the
   2016/2017 academic year. In total, 45 trained peer educators from the
   sixth form and 455 Year 7 students completed pre- and
   post-questionnaires assessing their emotional and behavioural
   difficulties, perceived school climate, and knowledge, skills and
   confidence related to mental health. Findings Results indicate that
   participation in the PEP is associated with significant improvement in
   key skills among both peer educators and student trainees, and in
   understanding of key terms and readiness to support others among
   trainees. Most students would recommend participation in the programme
   to other students. Originality/value While peer education has been found
   to be effective in some areas of health promotion, research on the
   effectiveness of peer-led mental health education programmes in schools
   is limited. This study contributes evidence around the efficacy of a new
   peer education programme that can be implemented in secondary schools.},

Title = {Effects of mindfulness, music therapy, and social support on adolescents
   test anxiety},
Journal = {BMC PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 14},
Abstract = {Background Test anxiety is a common form of situational anxiety among
   adolescents, which can seriously affect their academic performance and
   mental health. Guided by Emotion Regulation Theory and Social Support
   Theory, this study explores the mechanism by which mindfulness
   influences adolescent test anxiety, introducing music therapy and social
   support as chained mediators. Method A cross-sectional questionnaire
   survey was conducted among 372 adolescents from a secondary school in
   China. Measurement tools included the Mindfulness Scale, Music Therapy
   Perception Scale, Social Support Scale, and Test Anxiety Scale.
   Correlation analysis was performed using SPSS 26.0, and chained
   mediation analysis was conducted using the PROCESS macro (Model 6).
   Results The results showed that mindfulness had a significant negative
   effect on adolescent test anxiety (beta = -0.349, p < 0.001). Music
   therapy mediated the relationship between mindfulness and test anxiety,
   with an indirect effect of -0.074 (95\% CI {[}-0.109, -0.042]),
   accounting for 12.1\% of the total effect. Social support also served as
   an independent mediator (beta = -0.161, 95\% CI {[}-0.216, -0.112]),
   explaining 26.2\% of the total effect. In addition, music therapy and
   social support jointly played a chained mediating role (beta = -0.029,
   95\% CI {[}-0.049, -0.014]), accounting for 4.8\% of the total effect.
   Conclusion Mindfulness can alleviate adolescent test anxiety both
   directly and indirectly through music therapy and social support. This
   study reveals the potential mechanisms of mindfulness-based
   interventions and provides theoretical and practical implications for
   school-based mental health education. Especially in resource-limited
   settings, promoting mindfulness training and music therapy appears to be
   a feasible and valuable intervention strategy.},

Abstract = {Cyberbullying is a worldwide problem affecting mental health, education,
   safety and general well-being for individuals across the globe. Despite
   the widespread availability of the Internet, research into prevalence
   rates of cyberbullying in Qatar is lacking and legislating for the crime
   has been slow to develop. Recently there have been some positive
   initiatives in the country such as a Cybercrime Prevention Law, the
   development of a National ICI' Strategy, and a website detailing safe
   practice guidelines for Internet usage. HoWever, the implementation and
   usage of these initiatives are still limited and there is a lack of
   awareness of cyberbullying in Qatar. As a result, the risk factors and
   consequences among school-aged children are unknown. The current paper
   presents an evaluation of the legislative and public policy solutions to
   cyberbullying available in Qatar, and outlines the critical challenges
   that could potentially face educators in shaping best practice
   guidelines for the future. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In recent years, children's well-being has become a hot research topic
   that has been increasingly gaining attention in the field of psychiatry,
   social work, psychology, and public health research. The present study
   was meant to explore the existing children's mental health service
   strategies and practices in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The data have been
   carefully collected through open-ended interviews and focus group
   discussions, by capturing the participants' experiences. This study
   counted with the participation of managers of child-serving
   organizations, mental health workers (psychologists, psychiatric nurses,
   social workers, and psychiatrists), orphans, and vulnerable children,
   including their guardians. The findings indicated limited access to
   specialized treatment, inadequate skilled human resources, lack of
   mental health education, and depicted that the local community preferred
   traditional medicine and religious healing practices in order to cure
   mental illnesses. Children's mental health services are at a
   disadvantage and the most neglected health program, needing urgent
   involvement of the local government, non-governmental organizations,

Abstract = {This chapter examines the evidence for the effectiveness of
   interventions aiming to reduce drug-related harm by improving conditions
   for healthy development in the earliest years through to adolescence. Of
   the interventions beginning prior to birth, there is efficacy evidence
   that family home visitation is a feasible strategy for implementation
   with disadvantaged families and can reduce risk factors for early
   developmental deficits and thereby improve childhood development
   outcomes. There is efficacy evidence for strategies such as parent
   education and school preparation through the pre-school age period. Some
   of the strongest evidence for efficacy in reducing developmental
   pathways to drug-related harm comes from interventions delivered through
   the early school years to improve educational environments. Of the
   interventions targeting the high school age period, school drug
   education has been the most commonly evaluated. The evidence suggests
   that short-term reduction in both drug use and progression to frequent
   drug use may be achievable through this strategy, but the prospects for
   longer-term and population-level behaviour change are still unclear. In
   overview, a range of prevention strategies have been developed and
   evaluated. Most of the existing evidence is restricted to efficacy
   studies and there are future challenges to progress evaluation through
   to studies of effectiveness. In general, prevention programmes appear
   more successful where they maintain intervention activities over a
   number of years and incorporate more than one strategy. Much of the
   existing research has been based in North America and evaluates discrete
   programmes. Future research should test effects in other countries, in
   different social contexts and seek to better understand the interrelated
   effects of combining interventions within a community. Developmental
   prevention programmes target different age periods and social settings,
   hence communities have the challenge of coordinating a mixture of
   programmes that address the local conditions that adversely influence
   child and youth development. There are opportunities in this work to
   coordinate prevention activities using funding from different
   jurisdictions ( e. g., crime prevention, health promotion, mental
   health, education, substance abuse prevention).},

Abstract = {Background: Mental illness, often linked to ignorance and superstitions,
   significantly impacts women's mental health, particularly during
   pregnancy-marked by significant physical, emotional, and psychological
   changes. Prenatal mental health screening face challenges like stigma
   and lack of standardized protocols, while family support is essential
   reducing stress and enhancing well-being. Aim: To assess knowledge,
   attitude and help seeking behaviors towards mental ailments among
   pregnant women and their families visiting primary health centers
   (PHCs). Methods: A cross-sectional study conducted at a PHC during
   antenatal checkup days over 1 month recruiting pregnant women and their
   family members aged >= 18 years. A total of 230 participants were
   recruited. Data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire and
   validated scales: Mental Health Knowledge Schedule (MAKS), Community
   Attitudes towards Mental Illness (CAMI-12 item) and Mental Help Seeking
   Attitudes Scale (MHSAS). Descriptive statistics, Chi-square test,
   Student's t-test, one-way ANOVA, Pearson correlation, and linear
   regression were used. A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically
   significant. Results: Most participants lacked awareness of mental
   illness during pregnancy and childbirth. Higher education levels among
   participants correlated with better mental health knowledge.
   Participants with greater knowledge and positive attitudes demonstrated
   increased help-seeking behaviors. Positive correlations were observed
   between mental health knowledge, favorable attitudes, and help-seeking
   behaviors. Conclusion: Poor knowledge and unfavorable attitude toward
   mental illness impact help seeking behaviour, among pregnant women and
   their families, compromising maternal and child health. Intervention to
   enhance knowledge, and promoting perinatal mental health services are

Title = {Simulated Patient Role-Plays with Consumers with Lived Experience of
   Mental Illness Post-Mental Health First Aid Training: Interrater and
   Test Re-Test Reliability of an Observed Behavioral Assessment Rubric},
Journal = {PHARMACY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) training teaches participants how to
   assist people experiencing mental health problems and crises. Observed
   behavioral assessments, post-training, are lacking, and the literature
   largely focuses on self-reported measurement of behaviors and
   confidence. This study explores the reliability of an observed
   behavioral assessment rubric used to assess pharmacy students during
   simulated patient (SP) role-play assessments with mental health
   consumers. Post-MHFA training, pharmacy students (n = 528) participated
   in SP role-play assessments (n = 96) of six mental health cases enacted
   by consumers with lived experience of mental illness. Each assessment
   was marked by the tutor, participating student, and consumer (three
   raters). Non-parametric tests were used to compare raters' means scores
   and pass/fail categories. Interrater reliability analyses were conducted
   for overall scores, as well as pass/fail categories using intra-class
   correlation coefficient (ICC) and Fleiss' Kappa, respectively. Test
   re-test reliability analyses were conducted using Pearson's correlation.
   For interrater reliability analyses, the intra-class correlation
   coefficient varied from poor-to-good to moderate-to-excellent for
   individual cases but was moderate-to-excellent for combined cases (0.70;
   CI 0.58-0.80). Fleiss' Kappa varied across cases but was fair-to-good
   for combined cases (0.57, p < 0.001). For test re-test reliability
   analyses, Pearson's correlation was strong for individual and combined
   cases (0.87; p < 0.001). Recommended modifications to the rubric,
   including the addition of barrier items, scoring guides, and specific
   examples, as well as the creation of new case-specific rubric versions,
   may improve reliability. The rubric can be used to facilitate the
   measurement of actual, observed behaviors post-MHFA training in pharmacy
   and other health care curricula.},

Abstract = {Screen-based simulation is an effective educational strategy that can
   enhance health care students' engagement with content and critical
   thinking across various topics, including mental health. To create
   relevant and realistic simulations, best-practice guidelines recommend
   the involvement of experts in the development process. We collaborated
   with persons with lived experience and community partners to cocreate a
   mental health-focused screen-based simulation. Cocreating meant
   establishing a nonhierarchical partnership, with shared decision-making
   from start to finish.In this article, we present 8 principles developed
   to guide our cocreation with persons with lived experience:
   person-centeredness, trauma-informed approaches and ethical guidance,
   supportive environment, two-way partnership, mutual respect, choice and
   flexibility, open communication, and room to grow. These principles
   provide practical guidance for educators seeking to engage the expertise
   of persons who have been historically disadvantaged in society. By
   sharing these principles, we strive to contribute to a more equitable
   process in simulation development and promote meaningful, respectful,
   and safer collaborations.},

Abstract = {Aim To examine public health nurses' education, training, and
   professional support needs in perinatal mental health. Background Public
   health nurses have a key role in supporting maternal mental health
   including screening, support, referral, and decreasing stigmatization.
   Design A cross-sectional survey. Methods Data were collected from a
   convenience sample of Irish public health nurses (N = 105) from December
   2016-February 2018. The anonymous postal survey consisted of the
   Perinatal Mental Health Questionnaire, Mental Illness: Clinician's
   Attitudes scale and Perinatal Mental Health Learning Needs
   questionnaire. Results Public health nurses reported good levels of
   knowledge (77.2\%) and confidence (83.8\%) in recognising women
   experiencing stress, anxiety and depression. They indicated less
   confidence in caring (50.5\%) for women. The average score for the
   Mental Illness: Clinician's Attitudes scale was 35.9 (SD 5.9),
   suggesting positive attitudes towards women with significant mental
   illness. Conclusion Public health nurses require educational
   opportunities to explore expressions of psychological distress across
   cultures and their own personal attitudes to mental health, systems of
   clinical supervision, and support pathways. Impact Generating new
   knowledge on the importance of incorporating an attitude component in
   perinatal mental health education for public health nurses.},

Title = {Mental Health of Nursing Students: A Bibliometric Review Based on
   CiteSpace Visual Analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NURSING MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {2025},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Background: The mental health of nursing students directly affects their
   future performance, quality of patient care, and personal development.
   Therefore, an in-depth understanding of research in this area can assist
   in implementing effective measures to improve the mental health of
   nursing students.Aim: This study used bibliometric analyses to identify
   and analyze articles, authors, journals, and research institutes
   investigating nursing students' mental health in terms of thematic
   structure and topic evolution, aiming to provide direction and guidance
   for future research.Methods: In this retrospective bibliometric
   analysis, data were downloaded from the Web of Science Core Collection
   on August 15, 2024. Subsequently, CiteSpace software was employed to
   analyze the annual number of publications and citations, explore
   relationships between authors, institutions, countries, and keywords,
   and summarize research hotspots and frontiers in the field of nursing
   students' mental health.Results: Articles published from database
   inception to August 15, 2024, were screened, leading to the retrieval of
   3803 relevant articles. The United States of America was the leading
   country in terms of research output on the mental health of nursing
   students, with 982 (25.79\%) published articles, while the United States
   Department of Health and Human Services provided the most funding.
   Furthermore, Happell, B was the most productive author in this field,
   with 80 published papers. Lastly, Nurse Education Today was the most
   prolific journal in nursing education.Conclusion: The main recent
   research trends include the psychological profile of nursing students,
   intervention strategies for improving the mental health of nursing
   students, and the influence of educational methods, clinical experience,
   and humanistic care on the mental health of nursing students. These
   trends imply that researchers should develop targeted training programs,
   apply information technology, and implement personalized teaching to
   enhance the psychological resilience of the nursing student population.
   Moreover, higher education institutions should provide nursing students
   with more comprehensive and effective mental health support by
   maintaining mental health files, strengthening mental health education,
   providing psychological counseling services, and establishing social
   support systems.},

   Recent Graduates' Readiness to Practice},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {77},
Number = {7},
Abstract = {Objective. To assess mental health education in the undergraduate
   pharmacy curricula in the United Kingdom and gauge how well prepared
   graduates are to manage mental health patients.
   Method. The authors conducted semi-structured telephone interviews with
   pharmacy educators and administered an electronic self-administered
   survey instrument to pharmacy graduates.
   Results. The mental health conditions of depression, schizophrenia,
   bipolar disorder, and Parkinson disease were taught, in detail, by all
   schools, but more specialized areas of mental health (eg, personality
   disorder, autism) were generally not taught. Just 5 of 19 schools
   attempted to teach the broader social aspects of mental health. A third
   of the schools provided experiential learning opportunities. Graduates
   and recently registered pharmacists stated that undergraduate education
   had prepared them adequately with regard to knowledge on conditions and
   treatment options, but that they were not as well prepared to talk with
   mental health patients and deal with practical drug management-related
   issues.
   Conclusion. The mental health portion of the undergraduate pharmacy
   curricula in colleges and schools of pharmacy in the United Kingdom is
   largely theoretical, and pharmacy students have little exposure to
   mental health patients. Graduates identified an inability to effectively
   communicate with these patients and manage common drug
   management-related issues.},

Title = {Moulding student mental health in Singapore's Character and Citizenship
   Education: projected pedagogic identities},
Journal = {PEDAGOGY CULTURE AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {33},
Number = {1},
Pages = {305-328},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {This paper examines the official pedagogic discourse communicating the
   explicit inclusion of Mental Health (MH) education in Singapore's
   revised 2021 Character and Citizenship (CCE2021) curriculum within
   Singapore's state-driven educational context of decentralised
   centralism. By adapting Basil Bernstein's theoretical work on pedagogic
   discourse - using William Tyler's typology of Bernstein's `Pedagogic
   Codes' and `Official Pedagogic Identities' - our findings reveal how MH
   in CCE2021 projects different, simultaneous student identities. These
   include retrospective identities of students as resilient,
   community-minded citizens; prospective identities of students as
   vulnerable cyber users requiring explicit guidance for their
   future-readiness; de-centred therapeutic identities of students as
   reflective, self-actualising students requiring psychological safety;
   and de-centred market identities of students as trained advocates and
   community first responders. Together, they generate a tension where
   therapeutic identities are positioned as prerequisite to the other
   identities, subsuming individual well-being within community well-being,
   and conflating the intrinsic good of personal resilience with
   instrumental notions of future-readiness. This expresses a paradox where
   state-student social relations are both transformed and continued, as
   concerns of student confidentiality and efficacy of help-seeking efforts
   persist. Overall, we contend the educational reform of MH in CCE2021
   accommodates rather than reconciles progressive concerns of youth mental
   health with neoliberal state imperatives.},

   and priorities of fourth year pharmacy students for mental health
   education under the following categories: (1) Content to be included.
   (2) What knowledge, skills and attitudes students wish to develop. (3)
   The teaching and learning approaches associated with developing these
   knowledge, skills and attitudes.MethodAn exploratory case study design
   was conducted in 2024 within an elective `Education and Training' module
   for undergraduate pharmacy students in Ireland. Eighteen students
   participated in the study and engaged in three different focus groups.
   The study was designed with student partners who supported the
   facilitation of focus groups and analysis of the data. Data analysis was
   conducted using thematic analysis on Nvivo software with a student
   partner. Final themes were agreed with the wider research
   team.ResultsFour main themes emerged from thematic analysis of focus
   group transcripts: (1) the pharmacist and pharmacy as a safe space, (2)
   adaptable communication skills, (3) integration of physical and mental
   health challenges across curricula, and (4) seeking authenticity in
   teaching and learning approaches. Students also gave insights into what
   makes a contact-based learning experience worthwhile for them, and
   expressed a desire for integration of patient and public involvement
   into education in order to create a more authentic learning
   experience.ConclusionPharmacy students find value in authentic learning
   methods, and appreciate when patients and patient groups are involved in
   education. Additionally, they see each other as an important learning
   resource and value small group work. These learning methods have been
   integrated into our mental health module in the form of patient
   speakers, simulation practice, and small group work activities.},

Abstract = {BackgroundPsychoeducation is a common element in psychological
   interventions for youth depression and anxiety, but evidence about its
   use with youth perinatally is limited.AimsThis review aims to understand
   outcomes and mechanisms of psychoeducation for the indicated prevention
   and treatment of perinatal depression and anxiety in youth.MethodFor
   this review, we synthesised published quantitative and qualitative
   evidence. Seven databases (ASSIA, Medline, PubMed, PsycINFO,
   PsycArticles, Scopus and Web of Science) were searched for studies
   published before 10 August 2021. We also had consultations with a youth
   advisory group (N = 12).ResultsIn total, 20 studies met the inclusion
   criteria. Seven quantitative studies examined multicomponent
   interventions that included psychoeducation, and one study evaluated
   psychoeducation as a standalone intervention for postnatal depression.
   Multicomponent interventions showed significant effects on postnatal
   depression in two out of six studies, as well as being effective at
   reducing prenatal anxiety in one study. Standalone psychoeducation for
   postnatal depression was also effective in one study. Evidence from 12
   qualitative studies, corroborated by commentaries from the youth
   advisory group, suggested that psychoeducation could increase knowledge
   about symptoms, generate awareness of relevant services and enhance
   coping.ConclusionsPsychoeducation may be an important foundational
   ingredient of interventions for perinatal depression and, potentially,
   anxiety in adolescents and young adults through stimulating help-seeking
   and self-care.},

Title = {Drafting the Aboriginal and Islander Mental Health Initiative for Youth
   (AIMhi-Y) App: Results of a formative mixed methods study},
Journal = {INTERNET INTERVENTIONS-THE APPLICATION OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN
   MENTAL AND BEHAVIOURAL HEALTH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {21},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background: Culturally responsive, strengths-based early-intervention
   mental health treatment programs are considered most appropriate to
   influence the high rates of psychological distress and suicide
   experienced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth. Few early
   intervention services effectively bridge the socio-cultural and
   geographic challenges of providing sufficient and culturally relevant
   services in rural and remote Australia. Mental Health apps provide an
   opportunity to bridge current gaps in service access if co-designed with
   Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth to meet their needs.
   Aims: This paper reports the results of the formative stage of the
   AIMhi-Y App development process which engaged Aboriginal and Torres
   Strait Islander youth in the co-design of the new culturally informed
   AIMhi-Y App.
   Methods: Using a participatory design research approach, a series of
   co-design workshops were held across three sites with five groups of
   young people. Workshops explored concepts, understanding, language,
   acceptability of electronic mental health tools (e-mental health) and
   identified important characteristics of the presented applications and
   websites, chosen for relevance to this group. An additional peer
   supported online survey explored use of technology, help seeking and
   e-mental health design elements which contribute to acceptability.
   Results: Forty-five, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth, aged
   10-18 years, from three sites in the Northern Territory (NT) were
   involved in the workshops (n = 29). Although experiencing psychological
   distress, participants faced barriers to help seeking. Apps were
   perceived as a potential solution to overcome barriers by increasing
   mental health literacy, providing anonymity if desired, and linking
   young people with further help. Preferred app characteristics included a
   strength-based approach, mental health information, relatable content
   and a fun, appealing, easy to use interface which encouraged app
   progression. Findings informed the new AIMhi-Y App draft, which is a
   strengths-based early intervention wellbeing app for Aboriginal and
   Torres Strait Islander youth.
   Conclusions: Research findings highlight the need, feasibility and
   potential of these types of tools, from the perspective of Aboriginal
   and Torres Strait Islander youth.},

Title = {A co-designed website (FindWays) to improve mental health literacy of
   parents of children with mental health problems: Protocol for a pilot
   randomised controlled trial},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 21},
Abstract = {Background Mental health problems, such as behavioural and emotional
   problems, are prevalent in children. These problems can have long
   lasting, detrimental effects on the child, their parents and society.
   Most children with a mental health problem do not receive professional
   help. Those that do get help can face long wait times. While waiting,
   parents want to learn how they can help their child. To address this
   need, we co-designed a new website to help parents find ways of helping
   their child's mental health problem while waiting to get specialist
   help.
   Objectives To assess the acceptability and feasibility of a new
   co-designed website, FindWays, through a pilot randomised controlled
   trial. The protocol is registered with ISRCTN (ISRCTN64605513).
   Methods This study will recruit up to 60 parents of children aged
   two-twelve years old referred to a paediatrician for behavioural and/or
   emotional problems. Participants will be randomly allocated by computer
   generated number sequence to either the intervention or control group.
   Intervention group participants will receive access to the FindWays
   website to help them manage their child's mental health problem while
   they wait to see the paediatrician. Acceptability and feasibility will
   be assessed over the 4-month intervention through mixed methods
   including: recruitment, adherence, retention, net promoter score
   (quantitative measures) and semi-structured interviews to gain an
   in-depth understanding of parents' experience and potential adverse
   effects (qualitative measure). Secondary outcomes measured by parent
   survey at 4-months post randomisation include child mental health,
   parent mental health, impact of the child's mental health problem on
   their functioning and family, and health service use and associated
   costs.
   Results Recruitment commenced June 2022 with publication expected in
   October 2023.
   ConclusionThis study will provide novel data on the acceptability and
   feasibility of a new website co-designed with parents to help them find
   ways of managing their child's behaviour and emotions.},

Abstract = {BackgroundEarly intervention gives young people the best chance to
   recover from eating disorders (EDs). An important focus of early
   intervention is shortening the time between a person first developing
   symptoms and starting treatment (duration of untreated eating disorder;
   DUED). Patient-related factors (e.g. poor mental health literacy and
   help-seeking difficulties) are strongly associated with DUED. The aims
   of our study are to co-design and test the feasibility of FREED-Mobile
   (FREED-M), an online intervention tool for young people with early-stage
   EDs. This tool aims to improve knowledge about EDs, increase motivation
   to seek treatment and teach early steps towards change or recovery, thus
   reducing DUED.MethodsWe will carry out a randomised controlled
   feasibility trial comparing the FREED-M tool with a control intervention
   where individuals are sign-posted to an ED charity website. The
   objectives of the proposed trial are to establish/estimate: (a)
   attrition rates at follow-up (primary feasibility outcome); (b)
   participant recruitment; (c) intervention uptake, completion rates and
   acceptability; (d) intervention effect sizes and standard deviations for
   outcomes to inform the sample size calculation for a large-scale
   randomised controlled trial (RCT); (e) stakeholder views on the
   intervention.We aim to recruit 116 participants (young people, aged
   16-25, with first episode ED) from primary care, schools and
   universities, ED services and social media. Online assessments will be
   carried out at baseline, end of intervention and follow-up (weeks 0, 4
   and 12 post-randomisation, respectively). Outcomes will include
   motivation and readiness to change, attitudes and intentions towards
   help-seeking, ED symptoms, mood and social functioning, and
   health-related quality of life. Additionally, we will carry out a
   qualitative evaluation of participants' views of the intervention and

   (e.g. sample size, primary outcomes) of a future large-scale RCT to
   assess the effectiveness of the FREED-M intervention. If effective, this

Title = {The Hodgepodge Reality: A Qualitative Systematic Review of the
   Challenges and Barriers in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Care
   Systems},

Abstract = {The literature to date has documented the presence of challenges and
   barriers in mental health systems and services for children and
   adolescents worldwide. However, studies addressing this reality often do
   so in a fragmented, residual, incomplete, or generalized way, therefore
   hindering a comprehensive understanding of this complex phenomenon. The
   aim of this qualitative systematic review is to analyze the barriers and
   challenges affecting global mental health care for children and
   adolescents. Searches were made in the Web of Science, Scopus, and
   PubMed databases between 2018 and 2022 using terms connected with mental
   health, childhood, adolescence, and health systems. The search resulted
   in the extraction of 9075 articles, of which 51 were considered eligible
   for inclusion and complied with quality indicators. A number of closely
   related structural, financial, attitudinal, and treatment barriers that
   limited the quality of life and well-being of children and adolescents
   with mental health needs were found. These barriers included inadequate
   public policies, operational deficiencies, insufficient insurance
   coverage, privatization of services, stigma, lack of mental health
   literacy, lack of training, overburdened care, dehumanization of care,
   and lack of community and integrated resources. The analysis of these
   barriers displays that this treatment gap reflects the historical
   injustice towards mental illness and the disregard for real needs in
   these crucial stages, perpetuating a systematic lack of protection for
   the mental health of children and adolescents. The complexity of the
   disorders and the absence of public resources have resulted in a
   hodgepodge of mental health services for children and adolescents that
   fails to provide the continuing specialist health care they need.},

Title = {Rethinking mental health provision in the secure estate for children and
   young people: a framework for integrated care (SECURE STAIRS)},
Journal = {SAFER COMMUNITIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4},
Pages = {193-201},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to outline the challenges to
   achieving positive outcomes for young people within the secure estate in
   England, and introduces a psychologically informed framework, SECURE
   STAIRS (SS), aimed at improving outcomes.
   Design/methodology/approach The paper argues that there is a need for a
   fundamental shift in the way care and intervention for young people
   within the secure estate is delivered. It gives an overview of current
   challenges and needs and summarises the theoretical concepts and
   evidence base which can guide practice and form the foundations of the
   SS framework.
   Findings The framework recommends that intervention shift from focussing
   primarily on individual assessment and treatment to a greater emphasis
   on supporting the work of the wider system of care. Recommendations
   include promoting trauma-informed care, a focus on the system dynamics
   within institutions and how these impact on the care young people
   receive, and on the collaborative development with residential staff and
   young people of formulation-led care plans that include a focus on
   issues of sustainability after leaving the secure estate.
   Practical implications These include the establishment of discrete
   residential groupings with truly integrated and trauma-informed work
   across residential, mental health, education and criminal justice
   agencies. This involves addressing governance issues around shared
   record keeping, and challenges to sustainability and the accompanying
   need for local implementation plans for each establishment alongside
   central support at a strategic level.
   Originality/value This paper describes a new and innovative way of
   working within secure settings to ensure children and young people's
   needs are better met.},

Title = {Family Talk versus usual services in improving child and family
   psychosocial functioning in families with parental mental illness: a
   randomised controlled trial and cost analysis},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Month = {MAR 28},
Abstract = {Background Parental mental illness (PMI) is common and places children
   at high risk of developing psychological disorders. Family Talk (FT) is
   a well-known, whole-family, 7-session intervention designed to reduce
   the risk of transgenerational psychopathology. However, very few
   larger-scale evaluations of FT (across only a limited number of
   settings) have been conducted to date while there have been no cost
   analyses. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and costs of
   delivering FT in improving child and family psychosocial functioning in
   families with PMI within routine mental health settings. Methods A total
   of 83 families with PMI, with children aged 5-18 years, were randomly
   assigned on a 2:1 ratio to receive either the FT intervention (n=55
   families) or usual services (n=28 families) across 10 adult, child and
   primary care mental health sites in Ireland. Parental disorders included
   anxiety/depression (57\%), Bipolar Disorder (20\%), Borderline
   Personality Disorder (12\%), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (8\%) and
   psychosis (2\%). Detailed assessments with parents were conducted at
   baseline and 6-month follow up. Results FT led to significant
   improvements in family functioning and child behaviour at 6-month follow
   up when compared to usual services, with medium effect sizes indicated.
   Parent participants with lower mental health literacy at baseline also
   showed significant post-intervention improvements. Those parents with
   less severe mental illness at baseline, and families with more partner
   and economic supports, reported additional significant post-intervention
   improvements in child depression/anxiety and parental mental health
   symptoms. The cost of FT amounted to euro761.50 per family, although
   this decreased to euro415.31 when recurring costs only were included.
   Conclusion The findings from this study, which was conducted within the
   context of a national programme to introduce family-focused practice in
   Ireland, demonstrate that FT is a low-cost intervention that improved
   child and family psychosocial functioning across different mental health
   disorders within routine adult, child and primary care mental health
   services. The findings contribute to the growing evidence base for FT,
   and provide a robust basis to inform practice and policy development for
   families with parental mental illness both in Ireland and elsewhere.

Title = {Contemplating Help-Seeking in Perinatal Psychological Distress-A
   Meta-Ethnography},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {18},
Number = {10},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Perinatal psychological distress (PPD) may cause delays in help-seeking
   in the perinatal period, which is crucial for families with small
   children. Help-seeking theories focus on rational processes of behavior
   wherein `help-seeking' is viewed as a decision-making process, in which
   action is preceded by recognizing a problem. We identified the phase
   prior to actual help-seeking actions as a life situation and a
   phenomenon through which to gain a deeper understanding from women's own
   perspectives. The aim of this study was to integrate and synthesize
   knowledge of women's experiences of contemplating seeking help for PPD.
   We chose interpretative meta-ethnography by Noblit and Hare (1988) and
   implemented eMERGe guidelines in reporting. The search was performed
   systematically, and the 14 included studies were evaluated with Critical
   Appraisal Skills Programme checklist (CASP). We identified seven themes
   and a metaphor in a lines-of-argument synthesis, showing that
   contemplating help-seeking is a multidimensional phenomenon. We did not
   observe a straightforward and linear process (as previous research
   suggests) but instead a complex process of contemplating help-seeking. A
   clinical implication is that service providers should work with outreach
   and develop their tools to connect with mothers with PPD. Another
   suggestion is to improve training in mental health literacy prior to or
   during pregnancy.},

Title = {Online Mental Health Animations for Young People: Qualitative Empirical
   Thematic Analysis and Knowledge Transfer},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 9},
Abstract = {Background: Mental ill-health is one of the most significant health and
   social issues affecting young people globally. To address the mental
   health crisis, a number of cross-sectoral research and action priorities
   have been identified. These include improving mental health literacy,
   translating research findings into accessible public health outputs, and
   the use of digital technologies. There are, however, few examples of
   public health-oriented knowledge transfer activities involving
   collaborations between researchers, the Arts, and online platforms in
   the field of youth mental health.
   Objective: The primary aim of this project was to translate qualitative
   research findings into a series of online public mental health
   animations targeting young people between the ages of 16 and 25 years. A
   further aim was to track online social media engagement and viewing data
   for the animations for a period of 12 months.
   Methods: Qualitative data were collected from a sample of 17 youth in
   Ireland, aged 18-21 years, as part of the longitudinal population-based
   Adolescent Brain Development study. Interviews explored the life
   histories and the emotional and mental health of participants. The
   narrative analysis revealed 5 thematic findings relating to young
   people's emotional and mental health. Through a collaboration between
   research, the Arts, and the online sector, the empirical thematic
   findings were translated into 5 public health animations. The animations
   were hosted and promoted on 3 social media platforms of the Irish youth
   health website called SpunOut. Viewing data, collected over a 12-month
   period, were analyzed to determine the reach of the animations.
   Results: Narrative thematic analysis identified anxiety, depression,
   feeling different, loneliness, and being bullied as common experiences
   for young people. These thematic findings formed the basis of the
   animations. During the 12 months following the launch of the animations,
   they were viewed 15,848 times. A majority of views occurred during the
   period of the social media ad campaign at a cost of (sic)0.035
   (approximately US \$0.042) per view. Animations on feeling different and
   being bullied accounted for the majority of views.
   Conclusions: This project demonstrates that online animations provide an
   accessible means of translating empirical research findings into
   meaningful public health outputs. They offer a cost-effective way to
   provide targeted online information about mental health, coping, and
   help-seeking to young people. Cross-sectoral collaboration is required
   to leverage the knowledge and expertise required to maximize the quality
   and potential reach of any knowledge transfer activities. A high level
   of engagement is possible by targeting non-help-seeking young people on
   their native social media platforms. Paid promotion is, therefore, an
   important consideration when budgeting for online knowledge translation
   and dissemination activities in health research.},

   clinical outcomes of Asian adolescents with anorexia nervosa (AN)
   treated with FBT.
   Method This retrospective consecutive cohort study of 147 Asian

   duration was 7.7 (SD = 6.1) months. The two groups' baseline
   characteristics were not significantly different. Weight restoration
   rates in the FBT group were significantly higher than the TAU group at
   6-, 12-, and 24-month time points. A linear mixed model showed the mean
   \%mBMI was significantly higher at 0, 6, 12, and 24 months in the FBT
   group. The median time to weight restoration for patients on FBT was
   shorter (FBT: 7.0 months, TAU: 19.0 months; 95\% CI {[}14.5, 23.5]
   chi(2) = 15.84, p < .001). Within the FBT group, those that completed >=
   9 FBT sessions had significantly higher rates of weight restoration at
   12 months. Across all participants, those with a lower starting \%mBMI
   were less likely to achieve weight restoration by 12 months.
   Conclusion FBT can be effectively implemented in a multidisciplinary
   eating disorder program managing Asian adolescents with AN with improved
   rates of weight restoration. Further research is needed to understand
   the predictors and moderators of remission using FBT in Asian
   adolescents with AN.},

Title = {An Exploratory Case Study of the Types of Resources Black Boys Use to
   Support Their Mental Health},
Journal = {HEALTHCARE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Black adolescent boys experience mental health challenges because of
   their exposure to a greater frequency and severity of psychosocial
   stressors. This study used a sample of Black boys at a high school in
   southeastern Michigan as a case study to understand the types of
   resources Black boys might use to support their mental health. After
   conducting a rigorous analysis of the study data using a rapid and an
   accelerated data reduction technique, four themes helped us answer the
   question: What kinds of mental health support resources are Black boys
   using? Four themes emerged from our analysis: online resources,
   community and trusted individuals, self-reliance, and additional needs.
   This case study is a springboard for further work to tailor a mental
   health education and support intervention, such as the YBMen Project,
   for Black boys and for building additional support amid the multiple
   crises occurring that impact their mental health and safety. Findings
   have implications for future research, practice, and policy to improve
   the mental health of Black boys in high school.},

Title = {Health Improvement and Educational Attainment in Secondary Schools:
   Complementary or Competing Priorities? Exploratory Analyses From the
   School Health Research Network in Wales},
Journal = {HEALTH EDUCATION \& BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {45},
Number = {4},
Pages = {635-644},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background. Implementing health improvement is often perceived as
   diverting resource away from schools' core business, reflecting an
   assumption of a zero-sum game between health and education. There is
   some evidence that health behaviors may affect young people's
   educational outcomes. However, associations between implementation of
   school health improvement and educational outcomes remains
   underinvestigated. Methods. The study linked school-level data on free
   school meal (FSM) entitlement, educational outcomes, and school
   attendance, obtained from government websites, with data from the School
   Environment Questionnaire (SEQ) on health improvement activity collected
   in Wales (2015/2016). Spearman's rank correlation coefficients and
   linear regression models tested the extent of association between health
   improvement activity and attendance and educational outcomes. Results.
   SEQ data were provided by 100/115 network schools (87\%), of whom data
   on educational performance were obtained from 97. The percentage of
   pupils entitled to FSM predicted most of the between-school variance in
   achievement and attendance. Linear regression models demonstrated
   significant positive associations of all measures of health improvement
   activity with attainment at Key Stage (KS) 3, apart from mental health
   education in the curriculum and organizational commitment to health.
   Student and parent involvement in planning health activities were
   associated with improved school attendance. There were no significant
   associations between health improvement and KS4 attainment. Conclusion.
   Implementing health improvement activity does not have a detrimental
   effect on schools' educational performance. There is tentative evidence
   of the reverse, with better educational outcomes in schools with more
   extensive health improvement policies and practices. Further research
   should investigate processes by which this occurs and variations by
   socioeconomic status.},

Title = {What are the barriers, facilitators and interventions targeting
   help-seeking behaviours for common mental health problems in
   adolescents? A systematic review},
Journal = {BMC PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},

Month = {JUN 11},
Abstract = {Background Increasing rates of mental health problems among adolescents
   are of concern. Teens who are most in need of mental health attention
   are reluctant to seek help. A better understanding of the help-seeking
   in this population is needed to overcome this gap. Methods Five
   databases were searched to identify the principal barriers, facilitators
   and interventions targeting help-seeking for common mental health
   problems in adolescents aged 10-19 years. The search was performed in
   June 2018 and updated in April 2019. Two independent screening processes
   were made using the eligibility criteria. Quality assessment of each
   study was performed, and findings summarised using a narrative
   synthesis. Results Ninety studies meet the inclusion criteria for this
   review for barrier and facilitators (n = 54) and interventions (n = 36).
   Stigma and negative beliefs towards mental health services and
   professionals were the most cited barriers. Facilitators included
   previous positive experience with health services and mental health
   literacy. Most interventions were based on psychoeducation, which
   focused on general mental health knowledge, suicide and self-harm,
   stigma and depression. Other types of interventions included the use of
   multimedia and online tools, peer training and outreach initiatives.
   Overall, the quality of studies was low to medium and there was no
   general agreement regarding help-seeking definition and measurements.
   Conclusion Most of the interventions took place in an educational
   setting however, it is important to consider adolescents outside the
   educational system. Encouraging help-seeking should come with the
   increased availability of mental health support for all adolescents in
   need, but this is still a major challenge for Child and Adolescent
   Mental Health Services. There is also a need to develop shared
   definitions, theoretical frameworks and higher methodological standards
   in research regarding help-seeking behaviours in adolescents. This will
   allow more consistency and generalisability of findings, improving the
   development of help-seeking interventions and ensuring timely access to
   mental health treatments.},

Title = {`` I don't care about my mental health because I have a physical

   behaviours of people with disabilities in Bangladesh},
Journal = {ACTA PSYCHOLOGICA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {251},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In Bangladesh, people living with disabilities are one of the most
   vulnerable groups, as they receive little or no assistance. They face
   numerous challenges regarding financial, social, and access to basic
   education and healthcare, which contribute to experiences of distress
   and mental health issues. However, there is limited research on the
   mental health needs of people with disabilities and the accessibility of
   mental health services in Bangladesh. This qualitative study addresses
   this gap by examining the mental healthcare-seeking behaviours of people
   with disabilities and challenges in care-seeking pathways and
   recommendations for devising an inclusive system in existing mental
   health services through key informant interviews and focus group
   discussions with 55 participants from four stakeholder groups. Findings
   highlight that limited mental health, literacy, stigma, and financial
   and logistical challenges, such as inaccessible transportation and
   distant facilities, hinder access to care. System-level barriers,
   including a lack of specialists and inadequate community-based services,
   further exacerbate the issue. Stakeholders recommended strengthening
   social support systems by providing disability identity cards,
   allowances, and access to inclusive education and employment
   opportunities. They also emphasized the need for awareness campaigns,
   better transportation options, and training for healthcare workers.
   Policymakers are urged to design culturally relevant needs-based
   interventions to improve mental healthcare pathways for people with
   disabilities while promoting multisectoral collaboration.},

Year = {2017},
Volume = {69},
Number = {3},
Pages = {218-225},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Objective: Mental health care is a demanding profession with high rates
   of stress and burnout. Given the implications of untreated illness, it
   is essential that mental health professionals feel able to seek help
   from appropriate service providers when required. This study
   investigated perceived barriers to disclosure and help-seeking within
   this population. Methods: A sample of 98 Australian mental health
   professionals and students (clinicians in training) completed an online
   survey assessing help-seeking intentions and past behaviour, barriers to
   accessing care for mental ill health, and concerns regarding disclosure
   of mental health problems. Results: Results indicated that while the
   majority of participants (89\%) would seek help if they were distressed,
   57\% acknowledged that there had been a time when they would have
   benefited from seeking help but had not done so. Reported barriers to
   seeking help included wanting to solve the problem on their own, fear
   about colleagues finding out, and the potential for negative
   consequences relating to the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation
   Agency's mandatory reporting requirement. Conclusions: The findings
   provide initial evidence that despite good mental health literacy, and
   personal experience with mental illness, significant barriers exist for
   mental health professionals seeking help for mental health conditions.
   This is a significant area requiring further attention. Future research
   to better understand the perceived barriers and association between
   attitudes toward mental illness and help-seeking in this population is
   required. Education around mandatory reporting requirements may help to
   improve help-seeking behaviour.},

   system building is by engaging youth as members of CSMH teams. Method:
   The current study describes the structure, process and impact of a
   school-based Youth Leadership Academy (YLA) that integrated youth
   leaders into CSMH teams with state, district, and school leaders. The
   YLA offered student leaders opportunities to (1) receive training and
   mentorship to enhance their capacities to serve as leaders on CSMH
   teams, (2) provide input on CSMH priorities and (3) set MTSS goals to
   advance emotional well-being in schools. This study summarizes
   youth-driven multi-tiered systems of support (MTSS) goals and action
   plans by youth participants and the impact of youth participation in the
   YLA on indicators of positive youth development. Results: Youth most
   often contributed to planning and/or implementation of Tier 1-Universal
   Mental Health supports related to mental health literacy and school
   climate. Pre-post surveys revealed YLA participation was associated with
   statistically significant increases in youth reports of core social and
   emotional learning skills, positive identity, and contribution.
   Conclusions: Schools can replicate the YLA structure to enhance MTSS and
   foster youth leader skill development.},

Title = {Brief admission by self-referral for adolescents who self-harm:
   discourses on involvement and responsibility among parents and other

Journal = {CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY AND MENTAL HEALTH},

Abstract = {BackgroundBrief Admission by self-referral (BA) was implemented in 2018
   in Swedish child and adolescent psychiatric (CAP) inpatient care. This
   intervention empowers adolescents to self-admit at their own request for
   brief periods to prevent self-harm and suicidal crisis. As BA enhances
   healthcare user autonomy, it is a timely intervention to consider with
   the emerging human rights discourse and rising imperatives for
   person-centered care in psychiatry. The present study explores talk
   about adolescents access to BA specifically in terms of involvement and
   responsibilities of parents and other significant adults in
   CAP.MethodsIn this qualitative study, we interviewed 26 significant
   adults (the majority being biological parents) of children with access
   to BA. Interviews were semi-structured, asking broadly about
   participants' experiences with BA. We used reflexive thematic analysis
   from a social constructionist framework to explore how participants'
   narratives drew on existing psychiatric discourses.ResultsWe constructed
   four themes around narratives of involvement and responsibilities in BA
   specifically and CAP generally: there's no need to be involved in BA,
   selflessly supporting child involvement, being insufficiently involved,
   and being left to shoulder everything. These themes illustrate a sliding
   scale from perceiving little responsibility nor need for involvement, to
   perceiving shared responsibility for children's well-being but limited
   personal rights, to being under-involved and even perceptions of being
   left with sole responsibility as CAP refused to provide
   care.ConclusionsParticipants' narratives could generally be mapped onto
   rights-based discourse, emphasizing that adolescents should have access
   to BA as it helped them care for themselves. As participants took
   various positions regarding the responsibility of parents versus CAP to
   protect and help adolescents, the risk of perpetually downplaying the
   needs of parents and other significant adults became apparent, along
   with the pitfalls of neoliberal healthcare management and
   responsibilization of child mental health. CAP ought to systematically
   inform both adolescents and significant adults about BA, strengthening
   mental health literacy among the target population. It also ought to be
   emphasized that supporting significant others is considered part of the
   purpose with BA.},

Title = {Progression of externalizing disorders into anxiety disorders:
   Longitudinal transitions in the first three decades of life},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANXIETY DISORDERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background: There is a notable comorbidity between externalizing
   disorders and anxiety disorders, which may be explained by the
   co-occurrence of two prevalent early-onset disorders, by shared
   vulnerability and risk factors, or as evidence that one disorder group
   might be causally related to the other. Aim: To investigate the
   longitudinal trajectories of externalizing disorders, their interplay
   with anxiety disorders, and putative predictors for symptom progression
   in youth. Methods: 1053 adolescents (14-17 years) from the general
   population were assessed at baseline and prospectively at 2, 4, and
   10-year follow-up using a standardized interview of mental disorders
   (DIA-X/M-CIDI) to assess ``early{''} (oppositional-defiant disorder,
   conduct disorder, ADHD) and ``late{''} (antisocial behavior, substance
   use disorders) externalizing disorders as well as anxiety disorders.
   Longitudinal associations and predictors for symptom progression were
   examined using Kaplan-Meier-analyses. Results: Lifetime prevalence of
   early externalizing disorders were 9.1\% and 6.4\% among those with and
   without any anxiety disorder. A late externalizing disorder was reported
   by 50.3\% of those with an early externalizing disorder and in 26.6\% of
   those with any anxiety disorder. Both early (HR: 1.5, 95\%CI: 1.0-2.3)
   and late externalizing disorders (HR: 2.1, 95\%CI: 1.7-2.6) were
   associated with incident anxiety disorders. Higher parental rejection,
   lower volitional inhibition, and higher volitional avoidance predicted
   incident anxiety disorders among those with early externalizing
   disorders. Discussion: Early externalizing disorders likely follow a
   homotypic continuity (to late externalizing disorders) and/or a
   heterotypic continuity to anxiety disorders, and thus appear as a useful
   target for prevention and early intervention.},

Abstract = {Objective: Gender differences in the association between depression and
   smoking has received inconsistent support among youth in national
   samples in the United States and other Countries. However, the
   examination of depression and smoking among South African male and
   female youth has not been sufficiently studied. This paper examines
   gender differences in the association between depression, racially
   classified social group (RCSG) status, social amenities, and grade level
   with smoking among South African youth in Cape Town.
   Design: Six-hundred twenty students completed a questionnaire on
   socio-demographic characteristics, smoking, and depression. Separate
   logistic regression procedures were conducted by gender to assess
   significant variations in correlates of ever smoker versus never smoker
   status and Current smoker versus nonsmoker status. Variables included in
   the models were Beck Depression Inventory scores, RCSG, social
   amenities, and grade level.
   Results: Primary analyses revealed that among girls, mild and severe
   depression were significant predictors of ever smoking status. In
   addition, girls who suffered from mild, moderate, and severe forms of
   depression were more likely to be current smokers than nonsmokers. Among
   boys, depression was not a significant predictor of smoking status.
   Conclusions: The results Support the need to incorporate mental health
   education strategies into smoking intervention programs, especially
   among school girls in Cape Town, South Africa.},

Title = {Longitudinal Relationship Between Bullying Victimization and Depression
   Among Left-Behind Children: Roles of Negative Thoughts and
   Self-Compassion},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {BackgroundLeft-behind children (LBC) in China have aroused widespread
   concern in society and the academic field because they have a high risk
   of psychological problems. For left-behind children, depression is the
   most serious problem. Bullying victimization has been evidenced as one
   of the most common causes of children's depression. However, less is
   known about its longitudinal association and the process for how
   bullying victimization influences depression among left-behind children.
   Thus, the presentation aims to explore the mechanisms underlying by
   considering the roles of left-behind children's negative thoughts and
   self-compassion. MethodsThe 3-wave longitudinal data were collected from
   a sample of 605 aged 8-11 from central China. We used the Olweus bully
   and victimization questionnaire, the children's automatic thoughts
   scale, the depression scale, and the self-compassion scale.
   ResultsBullying victimization positively predicted the depression level
   of left-behind children. Negative thoughts and self-compassion mediate
   the relationship between bullying victimization and depression. In the
   mechanism of bullying victimization on depression exists gender
   differences among left-behind children. ConclusionThe present study
   suggested the association between bullying victimization and left-behind
   children's depression and revealed the internal mechanism of negative
   thoughts and self-compassion. These findings provide a new perspective
   for left-behind children's mental health education and intervention.},

Abstract = {PurposeThe purpose of this study explores the perspective of key
   informants (educators, preceptors and former students) of the Kintampo
   Project, on the perceived effectiveness, gains and challenges in
   delivering this large-scale training innovation in Ghana. The problem of
   mental health care neglect in Ghana is gradually improving. The Kintampo
   Project which trained mental health workers in Ghana has played a
   critical role in increasing access to mental health care.
   Design/methodology/approachThis qualitative study explored participants'
   perspectives on the Kintampo Project in three broad areas: perceived
   effectiveness, gains and challenges. In all, 17 interviews were
   conducted with former students, preceptors and educators from the
   project. The interviews were digitally audio-recorded, transcribed,
   coded and analysed using deductive and thematic methods. FindingsThe
   participants perceived the project to have been successful in increasing
   the number of mental health workers in Ghana. The project provided a
   route for career progression for those involved. However, the Kintampo
   Project faced accreditation issues, low recognition, improper
   integration and remuneration of trained staff in the Ghana Health
   Service. This study points to the fact that the sustainability of mental
   health training in Ghana can be obstructed, because of this career path
   being less attractive. Further research is needed to explore how best to
   achieve sustainability of similar mental health innovations.
   Originality/valueThis paper shares the views of participants in the
   Kintampo Project.},

Title = {The Association of School Climate, Depression Literacy, and Mental

Journal = {JOURNAL OF SCHOOL HEALTH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {87},

Abstract = {BACKGROUNDAlthough school climate is linked with youth educational,
   socioemotional, behavioral, and health outcomes, there has been limited
   research on the association between school climate and mental health
   education efforts. We explored whether school climate was associated
   with students' depression literacy and mental health stigma beliefs.
   METHODSData were combined from 2 studies: the Maryland Safe Supportive
   Schools Project and a randomized controlled trial of the Adolescent
   Depression Awareness Program. Five high schools participated in both
   studies, allowing examination of depression literacy and stigma measures
   from 500 9th and 10th graders. Multilevel models examined the
   relationship between school-level school climate characteristics and
   student-level depression literacy and mental health stigma scores.
   RESULTSOverall school climate was positively associated with depression
   literacy (odds ratio {[}OR]=2.78, p<.001) and negatively associated with
   stigma (Est.=-3.822, p=.001). Subscales of engagement (OR=5.30, p<.001)
   and environment were positively associated with depression literacy
   (OR=2.01, p<.001) and negatively associated with stigma (Est.=-6.610,
   p<.001), (Est.=-2.742, p<.001).
   CONCLUSIONSPositive school climate was associated with greater odds of
   depression literacy and endorsement of fewer stigmatizing beliefs among
   students. Our findings raise awareness regarding aspects of the school
   environment that may facilitate or inhibit students' recognition of
   depression and subsequent treatment-seeking.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the question of mental health, in particular the
   manner in which it finds its way into education. Increased attention to
   mental health in education should be welcomed, but often the focus is on
   `problem-solving', which in turn confines the `solution' within the
   spectrum of preventive and corrective intervention. Often it is the term
   `mental health' itself that leads us to think of it, by analogy to
   physical health, as a kind of goal to be achieved, a recovery and
   recuperation-that is, something to be effectively aided and fixed. But I
   suggest that if there is any way that education can attend to children's
   mental health, it is rather by holding itself back from problem-solving.
   Then, other than considering the `problem' as an object of inquiry or
   introspection, attention can be turned towards the contextuality of
   human experience and what I shall call its fundamentally wounded
   condition. Hence, a shifting in the conception of the problem. I take
   the film Shoplifters as a starting point-that is, as a site where we can
   attend to the particularities of reality and the specificities of
   experience. Towards the end, it will become clearer how film can direct
   us to an alternative way to attend to mental health in education.},

Abstract = {This review synthesises current research on the prevalence and
   determinants of depressive and anxiety symptoms among medical students.
   It highlights significant mental health challenges faced by this group,
   emphasising the influence of various factors such as academic pressures,
   personality traits, and reluctance to seek professional help. The
   analysis also delves into the roles of gender and geographical
   variation, revealing how these factors contribute to differing rates of
   mental health issues among medical students globally. The findings
   reveal a concerning prevalence of depression and anxiety, with variation
   observed across different regions and genders, indicating the influence
   of cultural and societal norms on mental health. This review underscores
   the urgent need for enhanced mental health support and intervention
   strategies within medical education systems. The importance of
   incorporating psychological support programmes and mental health
   education into curricula is highlighted. By addressing these issues,
   there is a potential to significantly improve the well-being and
   academic success of medical students, ultimately contributing to their
   overall mental health and resilience in their future professional lives.
   The paper advocates for a multifaceted approach in tackling these
   challenges, suggesting that medical institutions should not only focus
   on academic excellence but also prioritise the mental health of their
   students, ensuring a more supportive and nurturing educational
   environment.},

Journal = {SOCIAL PROBLEMS},

Volume = {72},
Number = {1},
Pages = {41-55},

Abstract = {Despite growing research dedicated to investigating the mental health of
   Black boys, few directly examine experiences with their perceptions and
   understanding of mental health conditions such as depression. This study
   uses data from a social media-based intervention for Black males, the
   Young Black Men, Masculinities, and Mental Health project. In a focus
   group with 8th-grade Black boys, facilitators asked open-ended questions
   about perceptions of mental health and depression, views of manhood, and
   experiences with social support. Findings revealed this group of Black
   boys - while well versed in many of the causes, symptoms, and treatments
   for mental health challenges and depression - preferred to address
   mental health needs on their own and through informal familial support.
   It also revealed the boys wrestled with the complex ways in which their
   racial identity would affect their experiences with mental health. The
   findings speak to the importance of mental health education for Black
   boys and the need for further research incorporating Black boys' voices
   in their perceptions, experiences, and understandings of mental health.
   Finally, the study connects Black boys' perspectives with many of the
   perspectives of their racially diverse peers.},

Journal = {CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {113},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The aim of this article is to consider critically the relationship
   between professional and public understandings of Family Support. It is
   based on research comprising baseline and follow-up population surveys
   carried out with 1000 respondents in each phase to establish levels of
   public awareness of the Parenting, Prevention and Family Support
   services provided by the Child and Family Agency in the Republic of
   Ireland (McGregor \& Nic Gabhainn, 2016; McGregor \& Nic Gabhainn,
   2018). In the article, we draw on three main conceptual areas: Family
   Support, Public Awareness and Help-seeking. The findings either reflect
   some of the conceptual ambiguity in the academic field or illustrate
   major gaps between the theoretical and the actual. Thus, we found that,
   adults rely on informal supports in dealing with challenges and issues
   they face and that universal services are the next line of support, if
   informal sources are not enough, both of which reflect the literature.
   However, the findings show that the public do not see Family Support in
   terms of resource centers, specialist parenting programmes or other
   formal services. Rather, Family Support is more commonly associated with
   Child Protection. The findings and our analyses challenge us to provide
   better accounts of what Family Support is in order to ensure
   service-use, in particular in the context of preventing and / or
   intervening early to address the issues families face. Such accounts
   require more and better engagement with children, young people, parents
   and wider family members, and reflection by academics and researchers on
   the provenance of our own constructions of Family Support.},

Title = {Post-disaster mental health servicing in Pacific Island communities: An
   integrative review},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {38},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background: The aim of this review was to explore post-disaster mental
   healthcare in Pacific Island countries by describing: i) the mental
   health impacts following disaster; ii) general and post-disaster mental
   healthcare services; and iii) strategies to enhance general and
   post-disaster mental healthcare throughout Pacific Island communities.
   Methods: A systematic approach was undertaken to search the literature.
   Articles describing mental health in the ethnogeographic regions of
   Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia were included. Both thematic
   analyses and critical appraisal were undertaken to identify prominent
   themes and evaluate the quality of each article.
   Results: Of the 14 articles, seven (50\%) were classified as Primary
   Data Articles and seven were Secondary Data Articles. Seven studies
   focused on individual island nations and four (29\%) focused on the
   Pacific Island region as a whole. Three articles had a global focus with
   reference to Pacific Island countries (21\%). Six (43\%) of the articles
   discussed post-disaster mental health impacts and eight (57\%)
   identified the current services available to address mental illness in
   Pacific Island communities. Four articles (29\%) proposed future
   strategies to improve mental healthcare in disaster-prone countries of
   the Pacific.
   Conclusion: The review identified that post-disaster mental healthcare
   services are impeded by underdeveloped infrastructure, a scarcity of
   mental health practitioners and limited funding. Strategies are
   necessary to develop: i) services to address post-disaster mental health
   for children and other vulnerable sub-groups; ii) approaches to enhance
   mental health literacy in Pacific Island communities; iii) methods to
   decentralise mental health services, and iv) the presence of
   quantifiable data describing the incidence of post-disaster mental
   illness in the Pacific.},

Abstract = {Background Suicide is considered as one of the major public health
   concerns, which can be prevented with cost-effective and timely
   intervention. In Bangladesh, very few studies assessed the suicidal
   behavior of rural community people. Thus, this Bangladesh Community
   Mental Health Study (BD ComMen Study) attempted to understand the
   current situation of suicidality in Bangladeshi rural community people
   considering three-time frames: lifetime, past year, and past month.
   Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in a rural community in
   Bangladesh between May 17 and 31, 2022, using a cluster sampling
   technique. Information on socio-demographics, COVID-19-related factors,
   depression, anxiety, insomnia, and suicidal behaviors was collected. The
   Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test and logistic regression were used
   to analyze the data.
   Results During their lifetime, 33.1\% of the rural community people had
   suicidal thoughts, whereas 5.5\% made a plan for suicide and 1.8\%
   attempted suicide. The prevalence of past-year suicidal ideation was
   3.9\%, whereas 1.4\% had a suicide plan. In addition, 0.6\% had
   past-month suicidal thoughts, although none of them had planned or
   attempted suicide. The factors associated with suicidal behaviors
   included males, lower age, lower educational grade, low-earning jobs,
   living in a government-provided house, family history of mental health
   and suicide, and suffering from anxiety and insomnia.
   Conclusions Suicidal behaviors among the rural community people are of
   great concern as most of the rural people in Bangladesh do not have
   enough mental health literacy for treatment-seeking due to a high level
   of mental health-related stigma. Thus, this study would likely help to
   initiate further studies and stimulate suicide prevention programs,
   because most suicide can be prevented.},

Abstract = {China accounts for 17\% of the global disease burden attributable to
   mental, neurological and substance use disorders. As a country
   undergoing profound societal change, China faces growing challenges to
   reduce the disease burden caused by psychiatric disorders. In this
   review, we aim to present an overview of progress in neuroscience
   research and clinical services for psychiatric disorders in China during
   the past three decades, analysing contributing factors and potential
   challenges to the field development. We first review studies in the
   epidemiological, genetic and neuroimaging fields as examples to
   illustrate a growing contribution of studies from China to the
   neuroscience research. Next, we introduce large-scale, open-access
   imaging genetic cohorts and recently initiated brain banks in China as
   platforms to study healthy brain functions and brain disorders. Then, we
   show progress in clinical services, including an integration of hospital
   and community-based healthcare systems and early intervention schemes.
   We finally discuss opportunities and existing challenges: achievements
   in research and clinical services are indispensable to the growing
   funding investment and continued engagement in international
   collaborations. The unique aspect of traditional Chinese medicine may
   provide insights to develop a novel treatment for psychiatric disorders.
   Yet obstacles still remain to promote research quality and to provide
   ubiquitous clinical services to vulnerable populations. Taken together,
   we expect to see a sustained advancement in psychiatric research and
   healthcare system in China. These achievements will contribute to the
   global efforts to realize good physical, mental and social well-being
   for all individuals.},

Abstract = {Men are less likely to seek help for their mental health than women, but
   less is known about the specific patterns of help-seeking in adolescent
   boys and young men. This is concerning as adolescent boys and young men
   have high suicide rates but a low take-up of services. It is therefore
   of particular importance that the access needs of this group are
   understood. This review sought to identify the barriers and facilitators
   faced by adolescent boys and young men in help-seeking for affective
   mental health disorders. A search of the PubMed, APA PsycInfo, and
   Cochrane databases identified 3961 articles, of which 12 met the
   inclusion criteria. Six of the studies were qualitative, five were
   quantitative and one used mixed methods. Two authors independently
   extracted data and assessed the quality of the articles. Five key themes
   were identified, including the impact of social norms, with the
   subthemes of conformity to masculine norms and self-stigma, limited
   availability of information about mental health, and `male-friendly'
   mental health literacy campaigns. Other themes referred to the
   help-seeking preferences of adolescent boys and young men, in terms of
   informal or formal and online or offline help-seeking. Some of the
   factors were well-researched (e.g., conformity to masculine norms as a
   barrier) whereas other factors (e.g., self-compassion as a facilitator)
   were less researched. These barriers and facilitators need to be
   considered in the development of future strategies to improve the
   help-seeking behaviour of adolescent boys and young men.},

Abstract = {Aim The current study aimed to investigate beliefs about help-seeking,
   treatment options and expected outcomes for people with alcohol abuse,
   dementia, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and schizophrenia,
   using a vignette-based approach, among a sample of nursing and medical
   students. Methods This was a cross-sectional online study among medical
   and nursing students (n = 1002) who were randomly assigned 1 of 5
   vignettes. Questions were asked about whom could best help the person in
   the vignette, the likely helpfulness of a broad range of interventions,
   and the likely outcome for the person in the vignette with and without
   appropriate help. Results A total of 45.1\% of students recommended
   seeing a psychiatrist, which was the most common source of help reported
   for all 5 vignettes. Help-seeking preferences were significantly
   associated with age, academic year and vignette type. Respondents rated
   seeing a psychiatrist as the most helpful intervention (92.4\%) and
   dealing with the problem on their own as the most harmful (68.1\%).
   Then, 81.5\% of students indicated that the condition of the person in
   the vignette would worsen if appropriate help was not sought. Conclusion
   Medical and nursing students most commonly recommended seeking help from
   a psychiatrist for mental health-related problems, where help-seeking
   preferences were associated with various age, academic year and vignette
   type. As these students will be the future medical and nursing
   workforce, they need to be equipped with the skills and ability to
   recognize signs and symptoms of mental illness, to aid timely and
   appropriate treatment for people with mental illness.},

Abstract = {Worldwide, growing concern with young people's mental health is spurring
   service reform efforts. Such reform requires a full understanding of the
   experiences of young people and their carers when seeking mental health
   help. To generate such an understanding, we conducted a meta-synthesis
   of qualitative literature on the perspectives of youths and their carers
   on navigating mental health systems. Five electronic databases were
   searched (Medline, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, HealthSTAR). Studies were
   included if they explored the experiences of pathways to mental health
   services of persons aged 11-30 years and/or their carers; were published
   in English or French; and used qualitative methodology. Quality
   appraisal was conducted using the CASP tool. The synthesis of 31
   included studies yielded three themes-initiating contact with mental
   health services; characteristics of services' response; and youths' and
   carers' appraisal of services. Themes about initiating contact included
   mental health literacy, structural barriers, and social support. Service
   response-related themes included complex pathways, waitlists,
   eligibility, and fragmented care. In terms of service appraisal,
   positive encounters featured providers who were accessible and perceived
   as caring. Negative appraisals resulted from feeling misunderstood and
   excluded and being ill-informed about treatment. Across diagnoses and
   settings, youths and carers had difficult experiences accessing mental
   healthcare. While individual, social, and healthcare factors shaping
   pathways to care varied, systemic complexities were a common inhibitor.
   This synthesis informs recommendations for improving mental health
   services and youths' pathways to them. It underlines the need for
   grounding reform in youths' and carers' perspectives and needs.},

Title = {A research approach for co-designing education with healthcare consumers},

Abstract = {Context Community and consumer involvement in health professions
   education (HPE) is of growing interest among researchers and educators,
   particularly in preparing health care graduates to effectively learn
   from, and collaborate with, people with lived experience of health
   issues. However, to date there has been limited direction on
   methodological approaches to engage health care consumers in the
   research and co-design of HPE.
   Approach In this paper, we describe the background to our work with
   health care consumers including the five core principles for successful
   co-design (inclusive; respectful; participative; iterative; outcomes
   focused) and how they can be applied as a research approach in HPE. We
   introduce the use of arts and humanities-based teaching methodologies
   including engagement, meaning-making and translational education
   strategies to illustrate how this research approach has been applied to
   reframe mental health education and practice in Australia. Furthermore,
   we share some reflective insights on the opportunities and challenges
   inherent in using a co-design research approach in HPE.
   Conclusions For the consumer voice to be embedded across HPE, there
   needs to be a collective commitment to curriculum redesign. This paper
   advances our understandings of the educational research potential of
   working with health care consumers to co-design rich and authentic
   learning experiences in HPE. Co-design research approaches that partner
   with and legitimise health care consumers as experts by experience may
   better align education and health professional practice with consumers'
   actual needs, an important first step in transforming hierarchical
   health care relationships towards more humanistic models of care.},

Title = {The use of games in the classroom to promote mental health knowledge and
   healthy attitudes in adolescents: a systematic review},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {16},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Background: Many adolescents face significant mental health challenges,
   including anxiety, depression, and substance-related and addictive
   disorders, with a growing need for school-based preventive strategies.
   Traditional classroom interventions often struggle to engage
   adolescents, prompting the exploration of game-based approaches to
   improve mental health knowledge and foster healthier attitudes.
   Objective: This systematic review evaluates the effectiveness of
   game-based interventions implemented in classroom settings to enhance
   mental health knowledge and promote positive attitudes among
   adolescents. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted across
   Medline, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and SCOPUS, yielding 1,152 articles.
   After screening, 17 studies were included, most using cluster randomized
   controlled trial designs. These interventions addressed topics of mental
   health such as substance-related and addictive disorders, anxiety, and
   depression, employing playful activities like video games, virtual
   reality simulations, quizzes, and collaborative tasks. Results: The
   interventions showed positive effects on knowledge acquisition and
   attitude change, with high satisfaction reported by participants. Those
   programs targeting alcohol and tobacco use were particularly effective
   in improving knowledge and attitudes. However, the quality of evidence
   varied, and long-term effects were not widely assessed due to a lack of
   follow-up in most studies. Some interventions had a limited impact on
   self-efficacy and behavior change. Conclusions: Game-based classroom
   interventions show promise in promoting mental health literacy and
   healthier attitudes among adolescents. While short-term outcomes are
   encouraging, more rigorous studies with extended follow-up periods are
   necessary to understand their long-term effectiveness. Future
   interventions should focus on practical skill development and
   personalization to maximize impact. Systematic review registration:

Abstract = {People who have experienced mental health problems often encounter
   stigmatisation, mainly by professional mental health care providers.
   Therefore, involvement of experts by experience in courses taught at a
   higher education institution that provides training for future
   healthcare professionals aims at destigmatising mental illnesses. Peer
   trainers have a lived mental health problems experience who take on the
   role of trainers to present the latest mental health care trends and
   theories and introduce recovery elements into the educational process.
   The data on which the article is based were gathered over a period of
   three years from focus groups involving 2nd year students of the
   bachelor's degree programme of `Clinical Social Worker'. The results
   obtained clearly show the destigmatising effect of this type of
   teaching: what has proven to be crucial in this regard was, on the one
   hand, the experience of former patients, and on the other hand, a
   counterweight to the often-one-sided information prevalent in
   professional literature on mental health available in the Czech
   Republic. The teaching reinforced the students' ability to work in a
   multidisciplinary team together with a peer support worker and also
   undermined any prejudice they may have had towards people with mental
   health problems.},

Title = {Improving women's health during internatal periods: Developing an
   evidenced-based approach to addressing maternal depression in pediatric
   settings},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {15},
Number = {6},
Pages = {692-703},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The internatal period, the time between births of successive children,
   has become a focal point for risk assessment and health promotion in
   women's healthcare. This period represents a time when women are at high
   risk for a depressive disorder. The pediatric venue offers a unique
   opportunity for the identification and management of depression in the
   internatal period, as mothers who do not attend their own medical
   appointments are likely to accompany their child to pediatric visits.
   This paper discusses the role pediatric providers can undertake to
   improve women's health in the internatal period through the detection
   and management of maternal depression at well-child visits. Successful
   models of the management of depression in other primary care settings
   are explored for their potential for implementation in the pediatric
   venue. A specific model developed and implemented as part of a 3-year
   project is presented to highlight the feasibility of an evidenced-based
   approach to the management of maternal depression in the pediatric
   setting. We present evidence demonstrating that pediatric providers can
   successfully identify postpartum women with depression, monitor symptoms
   and treatment adherence, and communicate results to a woman's healthcare
   provider. Yet more investigation is needed to create preventive
   interventions for maternal depression that integrate evidenced-based
   practice standards for the treatment of depression in primary care
   venues into pediatric settings. Future programs and policies targeting
   maternal depression in the pediatric environment should address patient
   mental health literacy and stigma, the training and education of
   pediatric providers, and issues of privacy and reimbursement.},

Title = {Mental health and psychosocial interventions to limit the adverse
   psychological effects of disasters and emergencies in China: a scoping
   review},
Journal = {LANCET REGIONAL HEALTH-WESTERN PACIFIC},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {45},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Exposure to disasters and public health emergencies negatively affects
   mental health. Research documenting the psychosocial responses to these
   calamities in China increased dramatically after the 2008 Wenchuan
   earthquake. However, there is no comprehensive assessment of the
   available literature on China's mental health and psychosocial support
   (MHPSS) responses to these events. This scoping review systematically
   maps existing published research and grey literature sources regarding
   MHPSS to disasters and emergencies in China. We examined relevant
   literature in English and Chinese from six databases and official
   websites from Jan 1, 2000, to Aug 13, 2021, and included 77 full-text
   records in this review. The main types of interventions reported
   included a) stepped care intervention models, b) individual structured
   psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy, c) mental health education, d)
   psychological counselling, and e) government-based policy interventions.
   Most interventions were evaluated using quantitative methods that
   assessed the treatment of common mental disorders. The review found that
   rapid national mobilization, emphasis on resilience-strengthening
   interventions, and the widespread use of step-care models were essential
   components of reducing the adverse psychosocial effects of disasters.
   The review also identified remaining gaps, including a) a lack of
   integration of disaster-related services with the pre-existing health
   care system, b) inadequate supervision of MHPSS providers, and c)
   limited monitoring and evaluation of the services provided. These
   results show where additional research is needed in China to improve
   mental health services. It also provides a framework that other
   countries can adapt when developing and evaluating MHPSS policies and
   plans in response to disasters.},

Title = {Reciprocal relationship between interpersonal communication and

   years: Three-wave cross-lagged panel model},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {334},

Abstract = {Background: Depression among children has been a growing public health
   concern. It is generally recognized that individuals with depression are
   likely to have interpersonal malfunctioning. However, there remains a
   limited scientific understanding of the reciprocal relationship between
   interpersonal communication and depressive symptoms among rural Chinese
   children in a longitudinal approach. Methods: Therefore, guided by the
   interpersonal model of depression and the developmental cascade model,
   the present study conducted a cross-lagged panel analysis study to
   explore the bidirectional relationship between interpersonal
   communication and depressive symptoms across three waves among 2188
   elementary school students in rural areas of one county of Gansu
   Province, China. We also examined the mediating effect of resilience and
   sex differences of the models.Results: Our results showed that
   depressive symptoms negatively predicted interpersonal communication
   from T1 to T2 and T2 to T3. Interpersonal communication negatively
   predicted depressive symptoms from T1 to T2, but not T2 to T3.
   Furthermore, resilience showed significant partial mediating effects in
   the reciprocal relationship between interpersonal communication and
   depressive symptoms. In terms of sex differences, the significant
   relationship between depressive symptoms at T1 and interpersonal
   communication at T2 was found to be sig-nificant among male students and
   marginally significant among female students. The full mediating effect
   of resilience at T1 was found only among male students, whereas
   resilience at T2 functioned as a full mediator between depressive
   symptoms at T2 and interpersonal communication at T3 only among female
   students. Limitations: First, the present sample consisted of only third
   and fourth grade (i.e., in T1) students from one county in rural China.
   Second, the present study examined depressive symptoms instead of
   depression as a clinical diagnosis. Third, the third wave of the data
   was collected during COVID-19. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could
   unexpectedly pose on child mental health.Conclusions: The finding
   underlined the importance of providing comprehensive depression
   prevention and intervention from fostering children's inner resilience
   and promoting their ability to navigate interpersonal resources.},

   opportunities for early identification, prevention, and intervention. As
   part of a public health approach, integrating digital mental health
   tools into these settings can support broad access, enhance mental
   health literacy, and promote help-seeking behaviors among all students.
   When co-designed with youth and embedded within existing care systems,
   thesetools offer a scalable, proactive solution to support well-being
   across diverse school-aged populations. Objective: This protocol
   describes the design and implementation of a stepped-wedge clinical
   trial to evaluate the Connected for Wellness mobile app, a youth-and
   caregiver-facing digital mental health intervention. Developed using
   participatory informatics and human-centered design principles, the app
   provides culturally relevant content in English and Spanish. Features
   include self-guided wellness activities, well-being screeners,
   psychoeducational videos, and localized service directories. Machine
   learning algorithms personalize content recommendations based on user
   inputs and behavioral patterns. Methods: This trial uses a stepped-wedge
   cluster randomized design across 20 community-based sites (10 high
   schoolsand 10 primary care clinics) in 2 counties in California. These
   counties were selected for their high proportions of underserved youth
   populations. All youth aged 13 to 22 years and their caregivers will be
   invited to access the app. Sites are randomized into 2 implementation
   waves. The app is introduced site-wide as a universal public health
   intervention supported by on-site navigators and peer ambassadors. The
   primary outcomesare derived from a cascade-of-care framework, including
   identification of mental health need, referral to services, initiation
   of services, and engagement (defined as >= 3 treatment visits). Data
   will be collected via anonymous in-app analytics, monthly World Health
   Organization-Five Well-Being Index assessments, and deidentified
   electronic health and administrative records. Generalized linear mixed
   models will be used to evaluate differences in cascade outcomes between
   pre-and postimplementation phases while accounting for clustering and
   site-level variability. Results: As of May 2025, the mobile app has been
   finalized, institutional review board approvals have been secured, and
   all study sites have been recruited. Participant recruitment is
   projected to begin in August 2025. Data collection and initial analyses
   will begin in early 2026, with preliminary findings expected by October
   2026. Conclusions: This study tests a novel digital health intervention
   integrated into trusted care systems. If effective, the Connected for
   Wellness mobile app may serve as a scalable strategy to reduce
   disparities in mental health care access and engagement for youth across
   the United States. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT06122688;

Abstract = {Objective: To determine the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic
   and lockdowns on the mental health status, training, perceptions of the
   physiotherapy profession, and career plans of French physiotherapy
   students.Design: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted,
   representing the first and only survey of its kind, using a national
   online survey.Subjects: A total of 2678 French physiotherapy stu-dents
   participated in the study.Methods: Mental health status was assessed
   using the validated French versions of established depres-sion, anxiety,
   and insomnia scales.Results: The survey revealed that female sex, age
   below 21 years, living alone, and having a psychiatric history or
   COVID-19 risk factors were associated with more severe symptoms of
   depression, anxiety, and insomnia in the surveyed students. In addition,
   stress, anxiety, and depression induced by the COVID-19 crisis were
   linked to apprehension about continuing practical training in
   physiotherapy. These factors also affected students' perceptions of the
   profession and the initially envisioned mode of practice, particularly
   among fifth-year students (odds ratio (OR) = 2.25, 95\% confidence
   interval (95\% CI) = (1.69, 2.99), p < 0.001). Notably, the pandemic
   significantly reduced the desire of these students to pursue a career as
   physiotherapists (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.41 (1.06, 1.86)).Conclusion:
   French physiotherapy students, especially those in their fifth year,
   have experienced signi-ficant impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic,
   affecting their mental health, education, perceptions of the
   physiotherapy profession, and career plans.},

Abstract = {BackgroundMeaningful involvement of young People with Lived Experience
   (PWLE) in co-designing youth mental health interventions has been much
   emphasized globally. However, there is a scarcity of evidence on
   involving PWLE of mental health problems in designing, implementing and
   evaluating mental health interventions, especially in Low- and
   Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). The aim of the current study was to
   understand the perspectives of young PWLE from two South Asian
   countries, Pakistan and India, regarding ``Active Ingredients{''} (AIs)
   for youth mental health (i.e., components or processes of mental health
   intervention(s) that make a difference to mental health outcomes), as
   part of the Wellcome Trust AI Commission.MethodsFor this exploratory
   qualitative study, we conducted 30 qualitative interviews via Zoom with
   young PWLE from Pakistan (n = 19, 14 females and 5 males) and India (n =
   11, 8 females and 3 males) to explore their views about different AIs
   for youth anxiety and depression in South Asia. The qualitative data was
   analysed using a thematic analysis approach that moved through the
   phases of familiarization, generation of codes, searching,
   identification and review of themes and selection of illustrative
   quotes.ResultsThe results show that family and religion are integral to
   promoting positive youth mental health in the South Asian context. The
   AIs perceived to be most relevant for Pakistani and Indian young people
   were (i) improving social relationships; (ii) managing emotions; and
   (iii) relaxation techniques. Participants highlighted the need to
   explore the role of family support, personal space,
   spirituality/religion, schools, mental health literacy and stigma as
   potential AIs of mental health for young people in South Asia. The need
   for ease of access to mental health support and minimizing barriers to
   engagement with mental health services were highlighted as important
   contextual factors. Our findings highlight the need for culturally
   responsive youth mental health strategies that incorporate their
   preferred intervention components and address key challenges including
   stigma faced by South Asian youth.ConclusionsThe current study
   highlights specific intervention components and contextual
   considerations that are important to Indian and Pakistani young PWLE
   when designing and delivering mental health interventions. Our findings
   underscore the need to work with young PWLE and consider their context,
   culture, and resources when developing or evaluating mental health
   interventions. Given our sample likely represents a relatively
   advantaged group, future studies can use targeted sampling strategies to
   capture perspectives of young people from lower socio-economic strata.},

Abstract = {Aims: Wellbeing literacy is the intentional use of wellbeing relevant
   vocabulary, knowledge and language skills to maintain or improve the
   wellbeing of oneself, others and the world. In this study, we
   operationalize the human aspects of the concept of wellbeing literacy
   and empirically test its relationship with wellbeing and illbeing. We
   also assess its incremental variance in wellbeing and illbeing, after
   controlling for existing and well-established predictors of these
   constructs within education settings. Methods: We developed and
   empirically tested the Wellbeing literacy 6-item (Well-Lit 6) scale to
   assess the concept of wellbeing literacy in the education context. The
   scale was developed based on a working definition of wellbeing literacy,
   in combination with the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting
   Authority (ACARA)'s definition of literacy. The Well-Lit 6 was
   administered via a cross-sectional survey to three Australian samples
   that comprise different elements of Australian education systems:
   students (N = 1392), parents (N = 584) and school staff (N = 317).
   Results: Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) suggested the six items of
   the Well-Lit 6 form an independent construct, empirically
   distinguishable from other wellbeing-related constructs (e.g., general
   wellbeing, resilience, and emotion regulation). Convergent analyses
   showed wellbeing literacy was positively related to wellbeing and
   negatively related to illbeing. Incremental validity analyses showed
   wellbeing literacy predicted variance in wellbeing and illbeing after
   controlling for participant demographics, resilience, and emotion
   regulation, showing initial evidence of incremental validity.
   Conclusions: Our results provide preliminary evidence that wellbeing
   literacy is a distinct construct from wellbeing and illbeing, and it
   also demonstrates significant unique variance in these constructs over
   and above resilience and emotion regulation. The Well-Lit 6 is a useful
   provisional measure of wellbeing literacy, although we suggest a
   fruitful avenue for future research is to develop a more comprehensive
   scale of wellbeing literacy that denotes specific facets of
   communication, allowing a fuller exploration wellbeing literacy, its
   components, and their antecedents and consequences. We offer further
   recommendations for future research and discuss limitations with our
   approach.},

Abstract = {Aim:
   Studying what factors and behaviours to work on may be a key to develop
   the effective prevention of future mental disorder in both high-risk and
   general young subjects. This study aimed to investigate whether twins
   are more vulnerable to mental health problems including psychotic-like
   experiences (PLEs) than singletons and what factors on lifestyle and
   social environment are associated with poor mental health.
   Methods:
   Subjects comprised 341 Japanese high-school students (173 males and 168
   females) including 62 twins. We examined PLEs, general psychological
   distress, length and regularity of sleep, domestic violence, being
   bullied and other environmental factors using questionnaires including
   the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). The variables were
   compared between twins and singletons. Whether variables on lifestyle
   and social environment affect PLEs and GHQ-12 scores were studied by
   logistic regression.
   Results:
   Significant difference was observed in PLEs and GHQ-12 between twins and
   singletons. Experiencing PLEs was negatively associated with being a
   twin (OR = 0.293, 95\% CI = 0.101-0.847) and length of sleep (OR =
   0.685, 95\% CI = 0.519-0.903). GHQ-12 > 4 was significantly associated
   with irregular sleep schedule (OR = 3.042, 95\% CI = 1.818-5.090), being
   bullied (OR = 3.677, 95\% CI = 1.317-10.266) and having no people to
   confide in (OR = 2.615, 95\% CI = 1.249-5.475).
   Conclusion:
   Poor mental health status including experiencing PLEs might be less
   frequent in twins than in singletons. Problems in sleep length, its
   schedule and human relationships were significantly associated with
   mental health in high-school students as we hypothesized. Early
   identification programmes and mental health education focused on these
   factors may be helpful.},

Title = {Exploring the benefits and challenges of being a consumer educator in
   nursing education: A scoping review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC AND MENTAL HEALTH NURSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {30},
Number = {4},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Accessible Summary What is known on the subject The mental health needs
   of individuals are increasing following the COVID-19 pandemic, with a
   need to focus on the education of nurses to be equipped to respond.
   Stigma around mental health still exists for nursing students, with the
   implementation of mental health education by an individual with lived
   experience having a known positive effect on stigmatizing
   attitudes.Research on consumer involvement in nursing education
   identifies that the consumer role is often varied and casual, with no
   existing review on the consumer experience.What the paper adds to
   existing knowledge The study emphasizes the importance of consumer
   involvement in nursing education. Alongside the literature focussing on
   the student benefits, this review highlights both the benefits of being
   an educator, and the challenges of being an educator from the consumer's
   perspective. Implications for practice The knowledge around the consumer
   perspective mapped in this review has the potential to impact and
   transform education protocols for consumer involvement in education.
   This can maximize on the meaningful contribution that lived experience
   has within mental health nursing education. This review enforces the
   need for an awareness of the challenges consumers face in their role as
   an educator, and highlights the need for further understanding of how to
   overcome these challenges. There is also an opportunity to capitalize on
   the benefits identified by consumers in their role within nursing
   education and sharing their lived experience. IntroductionWhile the
   mental health needs of populations are increasing, the targeted training
   of mental health professionals, specifically nurses, is required. Stigma
   surrounding mental health from nursing students exists, highlighting
   educational gaps. To address this, the involvement of consumers in
   undergraduate education has resulted in a positive effect on the
   stigmatizing attitudes of nursing students. There is still a limited
   understanding, however, of the consumers experience in this process.
   AimTo explore the experiences of individuals living with mental illness
   in educating nursing students. MethodsThe Joanna Brigg's Institute's
   (JBI) methodology for scoping reviews was used to search CINAHL,
   Medline, PsychInfo, Web of Science and Scopus including grey literature.
   The eligibility criteria for participants included individuals (a)
   diagnosed with a mental illness; (b) over 18 years of age; and (c) who
   participated in the educating of nursing students surrounding mental
   health in any context. Articles were only considered that were in the
   English language, and no time constraint was enforced during the search
   strategy for article selection. The search yielded 2640 results, of
   which 26 articles were included. ResultsResults found two prominent
   categories, including both benefits and challenges of being the educator
   from the consumer perspective. The benefits included: (a) the person
   behind the diagnosis; (b) reciprocal relationships; (c) positive effects
   on well-being; (d) unique contribution; and (e) purpose in storytelling.
   Challenges identified included: (a) vulnerability; (b) voyeuristic; (c)
   lack of preparation; (d) negative effects on well-being; (e) support;
   (f) not a real consumer; (g) variation of involvement; and (h)
   acknowledging consumer perspective.
   DiscussionAs consumer-led education for mental health nursing curriculum
   becomes mandated, amplifying the voice of the consumer in nursing
   education is crucial. While the benefits and challenges voiced by
   consumers in their involvement in mental health nursing education have
   been outlined here, further knowledge focussed on the consumer's
   experience as an educator outside the classroom setting, and in clinical
   practicum, alongside consumer involvement in specialized mental health
   education sessions, could aid in transforming consumer involvement.
   Implications for practiceThis review offers an incentive for nurse
   educators to capitalize on the benefits of educating for consumers to
   promote a meaningful contribution, while also practicing with an
   awareness of voiced challenges.},

Title = {Consumer-led Mental Health Education for Pharmacy Students},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {74},
Number = {9},
Abstract = {Objective. To evaluate a consumer-led teaching intervention to reduce
   pharmacy students' stigma towards depression and schizophrenia, and
   improve attitudes toward providing pharmaceutical care for consumers
   with mental illness.
   Design. Third-year bachelor of pharmacy degree students were given a
   series of mental health lectures, undertook supervised weekly placements
   in the community pharmacy setting, and attended a tutorial led by
   trained mental health consumer educators.
   Assessment. A previously validated 26-item survey instrument was
   administered at baseline, 6 weeks postintervention, and 12 months
   postintervention, and 3 focus groups were conducted. Survey instruments
   were completed by 225 students at baseline, 230 students
   postintervention, and 228 students at 12 months. Students' stigma
   decreased (p < 0.05) and their attitudes toward the provision of
   pharmaceutical services to consumers with a mental illness showed
   significant improvements (p < 0.05). These improvements were maintained
   at the 12-month follow-up. Four themes emerged from the focus groups:
   knowledge and experience of mental illness, mental health stigma,
   impacts on attitudes and self-reported behavior, and the role of the
   pharmacist in mental healthcare.
   Conclusions. Consumer-led education for pharmacy students may provide a
   sustainable reduction in stigma and improve attitudes towards providing
   pharmaceutical services to consumers with a mental illness.},

Journal = {CHILDREN-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Universal screening for postpartum mood and anxiety disorders (PMADs)
   has been recommended for all new parents at outpatient postpartum and
   well-child visits. However, parents of newborns admitted to the NICU are
   rarely able to access these services during their infant's prolonged
   hospitalization. The objective of this study was to determine the
   prevalence of mental health screening and treatment programs for parents
   or other primary caregivers in NICUs across the country. In this
   cross-sectional study, US NICU medical directors were invited to
   complete an online survey about current practices in mental health
   education, screening, and treatment for primary caregivers of preterm
   and ill infants in the NICU. Comparative analyses using Fisher's exact
   test were performed to evaluate differences in practices among various
   NICU practice settings. Survey responses were obtained from 75 out of
   700 potential sites (10.7\%). Of participating NICUs, less than half
   routinely provided caregivers with psychoeducation about mental health
   self-care (n = 35, 47\%) or routinely screened caregivers for PPD or
   other mental health disorders (n = 33, 44\%). Nearly one-quarter of the
   NICUs did not provide any PMAD screening (n = 17, 23\%). Despite
   consensus that postpartum psychosocial care is essential, routine mental
   health care of primary caregivers in the NICU remains inadequate.},

Abstract = {The reported study investigated the availability of institution-wide
   mental health support services and action plans for online students to
   address mental health impairments in Nigerian universities. The research
   questions explored how Nigerian online students perceived the mental
   health support services provided by their institutions before, during,
   and after mental health crises. Employing a descriptive phenomenological
   paradigm, semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine online
   students from Nigerian universities. The findings revealed a limited
   understanding of mental health issues among online students.
   Additionally, they highlighted the absence of institutional support
   services or action plans for promoting mental health wellness among
   Nigerian online students. To address these issues, the study recommends
   a pre-admission assessment of students' readiness to succeed in the
   online learning environment, an online learner orientation program, and
   mental health education to raise awareness of mental health impairment
   symptoms. This study contributes to the scarce literature on online
   students' mental health policy and support systems in Nigeria's distance
   education platforms. Also, it provides online education stakeholders
   with insights to inform online students' mental health policy.
   Ultimately, it may foster innovative practices and capacity-building
   programs among the online learning providers in Nigeria.},

   Functioning Among High School Students},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {ObjectiveThe purpose of this study is to explore the characteristics of
   the initial sandplay of high school students with poor family function,
   by studying the initial sandplay of high school students with different
   levels of family function, so as to provide the basics for the
   psychological assessment and intervention of high school students.
   SignificanceTo provide data support for high school students' mental
   health education and sandplay therapy, and to apply sandplay as an
   intervention method to play a healing role in high school mental health
   work. MethodsHigh school students (N = 345) were divided into 11 groups
   and participated in a sandplay experiment for 8 weeks from February to
   March 2021. Each group completed the Chinese version of the Epstein et
   al. Family Assessment Device. Samples with scores of one standard
   deviation below and above the sample mean were placed in the low family
   functioning group (n = 30; 15 girls) or high family functioning group (n
   = 30; 15 girls), respectively. The initial sandplay was evaluated on
   multiple dimensions using an established coding system. ResultsSamples
   with low family functioning used fewer animal figurines in their
   sandplay (t = 2.176, p < 0.05); had more family scenes (chi(2) = 4.356,
   p < 0.05); fewer rural scenes (chi(2) = 4.344, p < 0.05); and fewer
   healing themes (t = -2.336, p < 0.05). In particular, there were fewer
   examples of connected healing themes (chi(2) = 7.500, p < 0.05);
   in-depth healing themes (chi(2) = 5.455, p < 0.05); and more hindered
   trauma themes (chi(2) = 4.812, p < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis
   was conducted using the sandplay characteristics as predictors of group
   membership. Using forward stepwise selection, themes of hindered trauma
   (B = -2.030) and connected healing (B=1.765) were shown to be
   significant predictors of group membership (F = 17.784, P < 0.01, Delta
   R-2 = 0.214). ConclusionStudents who reported high and low family
   functioning showed significant differences in their sandplay
   characteristics. We propose sandplay characteristics can help identify
   low family functioning of adolescents during psychological evaluations.},

Abstract = {Research following Hurricane Katrina highlights significant
   psychological impacts on youth, particularly posttraumatic stress,
   anxiety, and depression. While most children and adolescents demonstrate
   adaptability over time, the specific pathways to resilience remain less
   understood. This study explored longitudinal community data on disaster
   exposure and traumatic stress across the 10-year recovery period after
   Katrina. The dataset included 60,703 screenings of children and
   adolescents from 2005 and 2015 (N = 35,000). Children who met cutoff
   scores for clinically significant symptoms were compared over time. A
   series of logistic regressions were conducted to assess factors
   associated with cutoff scores each year. Results revealed a steady
   decline in posttraumatic stress: 45\% of youth screened positive in 2005
   compared to 23\% in 2015. The most consistent contributors to elevated
   symptoms included loneliness, depression, anger, requests to speak with
   a counselor, and exposure to additional traumas. Other factors-such as
   property loss, relocation, housing displaced individuals, female gender,
   older age, and minority status-also contributed, though less strongly
   and consistently. Findings suggest that immediately after major
   disasters, roughly half of children experience elevated posttraumatic
   stress. By the 5-year mark, rates begin to approximate general
   population concerns (about 25\%), with approximately 10\% continuing to
   experience severe or persistent symptoms requiring clinical
   intervention. These findings underscore the importance of providing
   school-based mental health education on typical stress reactions and
   coping strategies, while targeting intensive clinical services for the
   smaller group with long-term needs. Importantly, youth in this study
   demonstrated remarkable resilience, offering valuable lessons to guide
   responses in future disasters.},

Title = {Mental health needs and accessing specialised healthcare in Mexican
   children with mental disorders: gender- and diagnosis-dependent
   differences},
Journal = {BJPSYCH OPEN},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},

Month = {NOV 23},
Abstract = {BackgroundAccess describes factors that influence the initial contact or
   use of services, emphasising both the characteristics of patients and
   the health resources that influence the use of health services.AimsTo
   compare Mexican boys and girls with mental disorders, with respect to
   primary diagnosis, symptom onset, and seeking and accessing specialised
   mental health services (SMHS).MethodLongitudinal data were collected
   from primary caregiver-reported assessments of 397 child-caretaker dyads
   (child mean age 12.17 years, range 5-18 years, 63\% male) that were
   obtained in two psychiatric hospitals specialising in child mental
   healthcare. Student t-tests and chi 2-tests were applied to compare boys
   and girls regarding their diagnosis and variables associated with the
   seeking of and access to SMHS.ResultsHyperkinetic disorder was the most
   prevalent diagnosis in boys, whereas depressive disorder and anxiety
   disorder were most prevalent in girls. The mean age at symptom onset for
   boys was 7 years, compared with 10 years for girls. Hyperkinetic
   disorder had the earliest symptom onset (mean 5.9 years), followed by
   depressive disorder (mean 9.8 years) and anxiety disorder (mean 12
   years). Delayed access to SMHS was associated with initially seeking
   care from a psychologist, whereas quicker access was associated with
   affiliation with the (now defunct) Popular Insurance, a programme that
   served low-income and uninsured individuals.ConclusionsProgrammes aimed
   at children's mental health education and early intervention should
   consider gender- and diagnosis-related differences in symptom onset and
   trajectory. Access to SMHS might be improved by rapid identification by
   parents, educators, primary-care physicians and psychologists.},

Title = {Psychoeducation for individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis: A
   scoping review},
Journal = {SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {252},
Pages = {148-158},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Psychoeducation is recommended in the treatment of patients with
   schizophrenia and has been shown to improve satisfaction with mental
   health service and treatment adherence, reduce relapse and hospital
   read-mission rates, and enhance functioning and quality of life. Youth
   at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR) may also benefit from
   receiving psychoeducation as part of their treatment. The goal of this
   study was to conduct a scoping review to map out the existing literature
   on psychoeducation for CHR individuals, including content, utilization,
   and benefits, in order to identify areas for future research and
   clinical care. Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic
   search of electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus, and
   Web of Science Core Collection) to identify literature through
   02/25/2022 that provided data or significant commentary about the
   provision of psychoeducation to CHR individuals. After screening titles
   and abstracts, four co-authors assessed full-text articles for
   eligibility. Thirty-three studies were included in the review. Psycho
   -education is recommended in the treatment of CHR individuals, is a
   preferred treatment option among CHR individuals, and many CHR programs
   report offering psychoeducation. However, details about the psycho
   -educational content and method of delivery are notably absent from
   recommendations and reports on the provision of CHR psychoeducation in
   real-world settings. We identified two brief and structured CHR psycho
   -education interventions and one longer-term psychoeducational
   multifamily group model for CHR that show feasibility and promise,
   though they have not yet undergone randomized trials to evaluate
   effectiveness of the psychoeducation. We also identified several
   comprehensive CHR interventions that included an explicit
   psy-choeducation module, though the unique role of the psychoeducational
   component is unknown. Despite being recommended as a critical component
   of treatment for CHR individuals and preferred by CHR individuals, the
   ways in which psychoeducation are being delivered to CHR individuals in
   real-world practice is still largely ambiguous. Rigorous evaluations of
   psychoeducation treatment models are needed, as well as investment from
   clinical programs to facilitate the implementation and dissemination of
   standardized psychoeducation for CHR individuals.},

Title = {The impact of universal mental health screening on stigma in primary
   schools},
Journal = {CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY AND MENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 29},
Abstract = {BackgroundPrimary school students struggling with mental health are less
   likely than high school students to access mental health care, due to
   barriers such as mental health stigma and low mental health literacy
   among children and parents. The near universal reach of schools offers a
   potential avenue to increase access to mental health care through early
   identification. The potential risks of this approach also need to be
   understood. This study monitored the impact of universal screening for
   mental health symptoms on stigma and mental health outcomes for primary
   school students.MethodsAcross 6 primary schools, a cluster randomised
   controlled trial allocated schools to one of two conditions. Conditions
   varied based on the order and frequency of symptom and stigma
   questionnaires. A sample of 798 children (8 to 13 years; Mage = 10.29)
   completed assessments at baseline, 6-week, and 12-week
   follow-ups.ResultsSignificant time-by-group interaction effects were
   present, indicating differing changes in mental health stigma between
   groups. Follow-up analyses of subscales showed significant time-by-group
   interaction effects for concerns around self-stigma and secrecy, but not
   for public stigma. The frequency and presentation order of the
   questionnaires impacted on mental health stigma. Initially, children
   reporting on mental health symptoms before stigma, reported heightened
   stigma, but over time, those receiving more frequent presentations of
   the symptom check experienced an overall stigma reduction, contrasting
   with an increase in the comparison group.ConclusionThe frequency and
   presentation order of mental health symptom assessments impact
   children's reports of mental health stigma, underscoring the importance
   of screening context. Potential screening harms, such as exacerbating
   self-stigma and secrecy, warrant consideration. Addressing
   stigma-related barriers is crucial for enhancing mental health care
   access for children in schools.Trial registration Australian and New

Abstract = {Aim Attempted suicide is one of the most important public health
   problems among preventable causes of mortality in the general
   population. Identifying risk factors for the prevention of suicide is a
   major public health goal. The aim of this study was to determine the
   annual rate of attempted suicide, related risk factors, and
   interventions, among referrals to emergency departments in the Sanliurfa
   province of southeastern Turkey.
   Subjects and methods Data were obtained from all emergency departments
   in the province based on the `Suicide Attempt Registry' standardized
   records for the calendar year 2010. Socio-demographic characteristics,
   aetiology, psychiatric history, psychiatric consultations, and
   interventions were examined. The groups were analysed with the
   chi-square test; the significance level was set at p<0.05.
   Results The annual rate of suicide attempts was 55.39 in 100,000 for the
   calendar year 2010. The rate was 3.47 times higher among women than men,
   and in particular 4.15 times higher for the 15-24 year age group among
   women than in men with the highest incidence of suicide attempts. The
   majority of cases were referred in April and May. Medication or toxic
   agent ingestions comprised 90.3 \% of cases. The main reason for
   attempts was family problems or domestic violence among women, and
   economic hardships among men, and rates of physical and mental problems
   were similar for both sexes. Only 8.8 \% of cases were subsequently
   referred for psychiatric consultation. Among cases with a prior suicide
   attempt history, 44.6 \% had a reported psychiatric disorder
   Conclusion The results of this investigation show that strengthening of
   surveillance and emergency healthcare systems, enhancement of mental
   health literacy, and inter-sector collaboration for development of
   community empowerment programmes are of vital importance for prevention
   of attempted suicide. The low rate of psychiatric referrals for
   subsequent intervention represented a major gap in urgent mental health
   services in the region.},

Title = {The importance and benefits of youth participation in mental health
   settings from the perspective of the headspace Gosford Youth Alliance in
   Australia},
Journal = {CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {46},
Pages = {294-299},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Objectives: Young people's participation in decision making that affects
   them is increasingly recognised and valued as a right. Youth
   participation in mental health settings is fundamental to service design
   and delivery, and is beneficial for the young people as well as the
   organisation. Headspace recognises the many benefits of youth
   participation with its national and local youth participation
   initiatives. In 2013, headspace Gosford in Australia established its
   current youth participation model, called the Youth Alliance (YA),
   consisting of 12 young people. These young people contribute ideas and
   opinions around service design and delivery, and participate in a range
   of activities.
   Method: This paper presents the findings of a focus group conducted with
   the YA immediately following recruitment. All 12 young people
   participated in a two hour focus group which sought to identify the key
   reasons these young people joined the YA, and what they hope to achieve
   in their capacity of VA consultants.
   Results: The two main reasons participants joined the YA are to help
   `overcome barriers to help seeking and ensure young people get the
   support they need' and to build confidence, social skills and make new
   friends'. The barriers to help seeldng identified by the participants
   are consistent with those outlined in the literature.
   Conclusion: Youth participation in youth mental health settings is
   beneficial to young people as well as organisations and the community,
   and it is crucial that strategies are put in place to increase youth
   participation. The ways in which these young people perceive their
   participation as beneficial to themselves as well as the organisation
   and the community is the focus of this paper. Crown Copyright (C) 2014

Title = {Barriers and facilitators associated with the use of mental health
   services among immigrant students in high-income countries: A systematic
   scoping review},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {18},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 29},
Abstract = {BackgroundImmigrant students face various challenges in high-income
   countries that can contribute to the decline of their mental well-being
   upon arrival in their host country. Despite the growing population of
   these students in several high-income countries, there is inadequate
   attention given to their mental health needs and their access to mental
   health services. Thus, this systematic scoping review aimed to identify
   gaps in existing research relating to the barriers and facilitators
   associated with access to and use of mental health services in
   high-income countries. MethodsFollowing the PRISMA-ScR checklist as
   guidance we systematically searched Ovid Medline, APA PsycInfo,
   Education Source, CINAHL, Web of Science databases for peer reviewed
   articles related to barriers and facilitators of mental health service
   use among immigrant students. We conducted a narrative evidence
   synthesis to highlight barriers and facilitators to the use of mental
   health services. ResultsOut of the 2407 articles initially found, 47
   studies met the inclusion criteria and were considered for this review.
   The increasing attention towards the mental health concerns of immigrant
   students and their access to mental health services is evident. However,
   various barriers like stigma, insufficient knowledge, or adherence to
   traditional gender roles (such as masculinity) hinder their utilization
   of these services. On the other hand, factors such as being a woman,
   having a strong sense of cultural adaptation, or possessing adequate
   mental health literacy serve as facilitators for accessing mental health
   services. ConclusionThese students have unique experiences, and their
   needs are often unmet. To improve their mental health and use of mental
   health services, it is important to consider the barriers they face and
   their unique experience in their specific life context and to develop
   tailored prevention and intervention programs.},

Title = {The experiences of family resilience from the view of the adult children

Abstract = {Aims This study explored how adult children perceived family resilience,
   barriers to develop family resilience and how cultural values influence
   their experience of parents with bipolar disorder in Chinese society.
   Design A qualitative design with an interpretive phenomenological
   analysis of data was employed. Methods Twenty adults who had lived with
   parents with bipolar disorder during childhood were recruited from the
   acute psychiatric ward when their parents were admitted to the hospital.
   They described their experiences of perceived family resilience and
   barriers to resilience (October 2013-September 2015). Semi-structured
   interviews were conducted in the hospital meeting room or at a
   convenient location. Findings Six themes were identified in family
   resilience: ill parents try to be good parents, parents' personal
   strengths, parents' positive attitudes towards mental illness,
   flexibility of family role, cohesive relationships between family
   members, and families' social connections. Three themes were identified
   in the barriers to develop family resilience: poor parenting/family
   function, conflict between parents and poor mental health literacy.
   Conclusion Children's views of family resilience could transform their
   suffering from lived experiences with a mentally ill parent to a
   positive growth experience. Family resilience includes well and ill
   parents' efforts and social network's help to maintain family function.
   However, the conflicts between well and ill parents and poor family
   function result in a traumatic growth experience. Impact To enhance a
   positive growth experience, family resilience programs for a parent with
   bipolar disorder aiming to cultivate both the ill and well parents'
   inner strength and their competence of parenting skills with connecting
   their social network to maintain family function is needed. Moreover,
   early stress-reduction intervention needs to be developed for children
   who did not experience family resilience.},

Abstract = {BackgroundMothers of children with a disability are at increased risk of
   poor mental health compared with mothers of typically developing
   children. The aim of the study was to describe the mental health care
   needs and preferences for support of mothers of children and young
   people aged 0-25years with a disability.
   MethodsA cross-sectional study was used, using an online survey with 294
   mothers of children with a disability. Questions were asked about mental
   health, perceived need for support, barriers to accessing mental health
   care, and preferences for support. Descriptive and chi-squared analyses
   were performed.
   ResultsHigh rates of mental ill health were self-identified in the
   previous 12months, with reported clinically significant depression
   (44\%), anxiety (42\%), and suicidality (22\%). Nearly half (48\%) of
   the mothers reported high to very high psychological distress. Although
   75\% of mothers perceived a need for professional support, only 58\%
   attempted to access this. Key barriers to accessing support were
   caregiving duties making it difficult to schedule appointments (45\%)
   and not perceiving the mental health problem as serious enough to
   require help (36\%). Individual counselling was the preferred type of
   support (66\%) followed by professionally guided relaxation (49\%) and
   education about mental health (47\%). Support was considered most
   critical at the time of diagnosis and during medical intervention for
   their child.
   ConclusionsAlthough mental health problems were common and mothers
   perceived the need for professional help, several key barriers were
   preventing mothers from accessing help. Our study suggests that
   improving mothers' knowledge of when and where to seek help (mental
   health literacy) may encourage their access to support. There also needs
   to be more accessible treatment to mothers given the high care demands
   that are placed upon them.},

Title = {Feasibility of Text Messages for Enhancing Therapeutic Engagement Among
   Youth and Caregivers Initiating Outpatient Mental Health Treatment:
   Mixed Methods Study},
Journal = {JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background: Pathways to mental health services for youth are generally
   complex and often involve numerous contact points and lengthy delays.
   When starting treatment, there are a host of barriers that contribute to
   low rates of therapeutic engagement. Automated text messages offer a
   convenient, low-cost option for information sharing and skill building,
   and they can potentially activate positive behaviors in youth and
   caregivers prior to beginning formal therapy. To date, there is little
   evidence for the feasibility of initiating transdiagnostic text messages
   during the early stages of youth and caregiver contact with community
   outpatient mental health services.
   Objective: To develop and test the feasibility of implementing 2 novel
   text messaging campaigns aimed at youth clients and their caregivers
   during the early stages of engaging with outpatient mental health
   services.
   Methods: A multidisciplinary panel of experts developed two 12-message
   interventions with youth and caregivers prior to deployment. Each
   message included a link to an external interactive or multimedia
   resource to extend skill development. Enrollment of youth aged 13 to 18
   years, their caregivers, or both occurred at 2 early treatment
   timepoints. At both time points, text messages were delivered
   automatically 2 times a week for 6 weeks. Analytics and survey data were
   collected in 2 phases, between January and March 2020 and between
   January and May 2021. Enrollment, willingness to persist in using the
   intervention, engagement, satisfaction, perceived value, and impact were
   measured. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize youth and
   caregiver outcomes.
   Results: A total of 41 caregivers and 36 youth consented to participate.
   Follow-up survey response rates were 54\% (22/41) and 44\%, (16/36)
   respectively. Over 1500 text messages were sent throughout the study.
   More than three-quarters (14/16, 88\%) of youth reported that they
   learned something new and noticed a change in themselves due to
   receiving the texts; the same proportion (14/16, 88\%) of youth said
   they would recommend the text messages to others. Youth ranked the first
   text message, related to coping with difficult emotions, as the most
   helpful of the series. Caregivers reported acting differently due to
   receiving the texts. Over two-thirds of caregivers were satisfied with
   the texts (16/22, 73\%) and would recommend them to others (16/22,
   73\%). Caregivers perceived diverse levels of value in the text topics,
   with 9 of the 12 caregiver texts rated by at least one caregiver as the
   most helpful.
   Conclusions: Results are preliminary but show that brief, core
   skill-focused text messages for youth clients and caregivers in
   community outpatient mental health services are feasible. Both youth and
   caregivers reported promising knowledge and behavior change with
   exposure to only 12 messages over 6 weeks. A larger study with
   statistical power to detect changes in both perceived helpfulness and
   engagement is required to confirm the effectiveness of this type of
   transdiagnostic intervention.},

Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {24},

Month = {APR 16},
Abstract = {Background Prevalence of self-harm In England is rising, however contact
   with statutory services remains relatively low. There is growing
   recognition of the potential role voluntary, community and social
   enterprise sector (VCSE) organisations have in the provision of
   self-harm support. We aimed to explore individuals' experiences of using
   these services and the barriers and facilitators to accessing
   support.Methods Qualitative, online interviews with 23 adults (18+) who
   have accessed support from VCSE organisations for self-harm in the
   Yorkshire and the Humber region were undertaken. Interviews were audio
   recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was undertaken
   using NVivo software.Results Participants described how a lack of
   service flexibility and the perception that their individual needs were
   not being heard often made them less likely to engage with both
   statutory and VCSE organisations. The complexity of care pathways made
   it difficult for them to access appropriate support when required, as
   did a lack of awareness of the types of support available. Participants
   described how engagement was improved by services that fostered a sense
   of community. The delivery of peer support played a key role in creating
   this sense of belonging. Education and workplace settings were also
   viewed as key sources of support for individuals, with a lack of mental
   health literacy acting as a barrier to access in these
   environments.Conclusions VCSE organisations can play a crucial role in
   the provision of support for self-harm, however, pathways into these
   services remain complex and links between statutory and non-statutory
   services need to be strengthened. The provision of peer support is
   viewed as a crucial component of effective support in VCSE
   organisations. Further supervision and training should be offered to
   those providing peer support to ensure that their own mental health is
   protected.},

Title = {An intervention to improve the quality of life in children of parents
   with serious mental illness: the Young SMILES feasibility RCT},
Journal = {HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {24},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Background: Quality of life for children and adolescents living with
   serious parental mental illness can be impaired, but evidence-based
   interventions to improve it are scarce.
   Objective: Co-production of a child-centred intervention {[}called Young
   Simplifying Mental Illness plus Life Enhancement Skills (SMILES)] to
   improve the health-related quality of life of children and adolescents
   living with serious parental mental illness, and evaluating its
   acceptability and feasibility for delivery in NHS and community
   settings.
   Design: Qualitative and co-production methods informed the development
   of the intervention (Phase I). A feasibility randomised controlled trial
   was designed to compare Young SMILES with treatment as usual (Phase II).
   Semistructured qualitative interviews were used to explore acceptability
   among children and adolescents living with their parents, who had
   serious mental illness, and their parents. A mixture of semistructured
   qualitative interviews and focus group research was used to examine
   feasibility among Young SMILES facilitators and referrers/non-referrers.
   Setting: Randomisation was conducted after baseline measures were
   collected by the study co-ordinator, ensuring that the blinding of the
   statistician and research team was maintained to reduce detection bias.
   Participants: Phase I: 14 children and adolescents living with serious
   parental mental illness, seven parents and 31 practitioners from social,
   educational and health-related sectors. Phase II: 40 children and
   adolescents living with serious parental mental illness, 33 parents,
   five referrers/non-referrers and 16 Young SMILES facilitators.
   Intervention: Young SMILES was delivered at two sites: (1) Warrington,
   supported by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
   Children (NSPCC), and (2) Newcastle, supported by the NHS and
   Barnardo's. An eight-session weekly group programme was delivered, with
   four to six children and adolescents living with serious parental mental
   illness per age-appropriate group (6-11 and 12-16 years). At week 4, a
   five-session parallel weekly programme was offered to the
   parents/carers. Sessions lasted 2 hours each and focused on improving
   mental health literacy, child-parent communication and children's
   problem-solving skills.
   Main outcome measures: Phase ll children and parents completed
   questionnaires at randomisation and then again at 4 and 6 months post
   randomisation. Quality of life was self-reported by children and
   proxy-reported by parents using the Paediatric Quality of Life
   questionnaire and KIDSCREEN. Semistructured interviews with parents (n =
   14) and children (n = 17) who participated in the Young SMILES groups
   gathered information about their motivation to sign up to the study,
   their experiences of participating in the group sessions, and their
   perceived changes in themselves and their family members following
   intervention. Further interviews with individual referrers (n = 5)
   gathered information about challenges to recruitment and randomisation.
   Two focus groups (n = 16) with practitioners who facilitated the
   intervention explored their views of the format and content of the Young
   SMILES manual and their suggestions for changes.
   Results: A total of 35 families were recruited: 20 were randomly
   allocated to Young SMILES group and 15 to treatment as usual. Of those,
   28 families {[}15/20 (75\%) in the intervention group and 13/15 (87\%)
   in the control group] gave follow-up data at the primary end point (4
   months post baseline). Participating children had high adherence to the
   intervention and high completion rates of the questionnaires. Children
   and adolescents living with their parents, who had serious mental
   illness, and their parents were mainly very positive and enthusiastic
   about Young SMILES, both of whom invoked the benefits of peer support
   and insight into parental difficulties. Although facilitators regarded
   Young SMILES as a meaningful and distinctive intervention having great
   potential, referrers identified several barriers to referring families
   to the study. One harm was reported by a parent, which was dealt with by
   the research team and the NSPCC in accordance with the standard
   operating procedures.
   Limitations: The findings from our feasibility study are not sufficient
   to recommend a fully powered trial of Young SMILES in the near future.
   Although it was feasible to randomise children and adolescents living
   with serious parental mental illness of different ages to standardised,
   time-limited groups in both NHS and non-NHS settings, an intervention
   like Young SMILES is unlikely to address underlying core components of
   the vulnerability that children and adolescents living with serious
   parental mental illness express as a population over time.
   Conclusions: Young SMILES was widely valued as unique in filling a
   recognised gap in need. Outcome measures in future studies of
   interventions for children and adolescents living with serious parental
   mental illness are more likely to capture change in individual risk
   factors for reduced quality of life by considering their unmet need,
   rather than on an aggregate construct of health-related quality of life
   overall, which may not reflect these young people's needs.
   Future work: A public health approach to intervention might be best.
   Most children and adolescents living with serious parental mental
   illness remain well most of the time, so, although their absolute risks
   are low across outcomes (and most will remain resilient most of the
   time), consistent population estimates find their relative risk to be
   high compared with unexposed children. A public health approach to
   intervention needs to be both tailored to the particular needs of
   children and adolescents living with serious parental mental illness and
   agile to these needs so that it can respond to fluctuations over time.},

Title = {Correct recognition and continuum belief of mental disorders in a
   nursing student population},
Journal = {BMC PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Month = {AUG 7},
Abstract = {Background: The current study aimed to explore the correct recognition
   of mental disorders across dementia, alcohol abuse, obsessive compulsive
   disorder (OCD), schizophrenia and depression, along with its correlates
   in a nursing student population. The belief in a continuum of symptoms
   from mental health to mental illness and its relationship with the
   non-identification of mental illness was also explored.
   Methods: Five hundred students from four nursing institutions in
   Singapore participated in this cross-sectional online study. Respondents
   were randomly assigned to a vignette describing one of the five mental
   disorders before being asked to identify what the person in the vignette
   is suffering from. Continuum belief was assessed by rating their
   agreeableness with the following statement: ``Sometimes we all behave
   like X. It is just a question of how severe or obvious this condition
   is{''}.
   Results: OCD had the highest correct recognition rate (86\%), followed
   by depression (85\%), dementia (77\%), alcohol abuse (58\%) and
   schizophrenia (46\%). For continuum belief, the percentage of
   respondents who endorsed symptom continuity were 70\% for depression,
   61\% for OCD, 58\% for alcohol abuse, 56\% for dementia and 46\% for
   schizophrenia. Of concern, we found stronger continuum belief to be
   associated with the non-identification of mental illness after
   controlling for covariates.
   Conclusions: There is a need to improve mental health literacy among
   nursing students. Almost a quarter of the respondents identified
   excessive alcohol drinking as depression, even though there was no
   indication of any mood symptom in the vignette on alcohol abuse. Further
   education and training in schizophrenia may need to be conducted.
   Healthcare trainees should also be made aware on the possible influence
   of belief in symptom continuity on one's tendency to under-attribute
   mental health symptoms as a mental illness.},

Title = {Development of guidelines for tertiary education institutions to assist
   them in supporting students with a mental illness: a Delphi consensus
   study with Australian professionals and consumers},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {1},
Month = {FEB 26},
Abstract = {Background. The age at which most young people are in tertiary education
   is also the age of peak onset for mental illness. Because mental health
   problems can have adverse effects on students' academic performance and
   welfare, institutions require guidance how they can best provide
   support. However, the scientific evidence for how best to do this is
   relatively limited. Therefore a Delphi expert consensus study was
   carried out with professional and consumer experts.
   Methods. A systematic review of websites, books and journal articles was
   conducted to develop a 172 item survey containing strategies that
   institutions might use to support students with a mental illness. Two
   panels of Australian experts (74 professionals and 35 consumers) were
   recruited and independently rated the items over three rounds, with
   strategies reaching consensus on importance written into the guidelines.
   Results. The overall response rate across three rounds was 83\% (80\%
   consumers, 85\% professionals). 155 strategies were endorsed as
   essential or important by at least 80\% of panel members. The endorsed
   strategies provided information on policy, measures to promote support
   services, service provision, accessibility of support services,
   relationships between services, other types of support and issues
   associated with reasonable adjustments. They also provided guidance on
   the procedures the institutions should have for making staff aware of
   issues associated with mental illness, mental illness training, support
   for staff and communicating with a student with a mental illness. They
   also covered student rights and responsibilities, the procedures the
   institutions should have for making students aware of issues associated
   with mental illness, dealing with mental health crises, funding and
   research and evaluation.
   Conclusions. The guidelines provide guidance for tertiary institutions
   to assist them in supporting students with a mental illness. It is hoped
   that they may be used to inform policy and practice in tertiary
   institutions.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To describe the functional difficulties of children with
   special health needs and to demonstrate the shared and unique
   contributions in predicting health outcomes and informing therapeutic
   interventions, policies, and research by using data from the 2005-2006
   National Survey of Children With Special Health Care Needs.
   RESULTS: Children with special health care needs experience an array of
   health conditions and functional difficulties that are interrelated.
   Although health conditions tend not to change, the characteristics of
   functional difficulties are subject to changes over time with age or as
   a result of interventions. Descriptive data highlight common functional
   difficulties across health conditions. Multiple regression analyses
   support both health conditions and functional difficulties predicting
   (1) health services, such as emergency department visits, (2) personal
   limitations such as impairment of daily activities and school absences,
   and (3) family impact, stopping or reducing work. Functional
   difficulties were, however, the stronger predictor for all outcomes
   except school absences.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results support the utility of expanding measures of
   children with special health care needs to include functional
   difficulties in survey research, as well as clinical and public health
   practice. Systematic inclusion of functional difficulties will inform
   policy development, program planning, outcome assessment, and resource
   allocation for this vulnerable population. A focus on functional
   difficulties facilitates stronger coordination of services across
   sectors including physical health, mental health, education, and other
   social services to improve the health and well-being for these children
   and youth. Pediatrics 2012; 129: e714-e722},

Abstract = {Objective: To study the mental health and personality of psychological
   commissioners and provide the timely help and pertinence training the
   healthy psychology and good personality in order to make them competent
   for the job and develop it smoothly in the future. Methods: 4531 persons
   which are included 337 psychological commissioners in grade 2010
   freshmen were investigated by using Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90). 3540
   freshmen which are included 240 psychological commissioners were
   investigated by using Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ). Results:
   In SCL-90, the total score and different factors values of those
   psychological commissioners were markedly lower than the other freshmen.
   In addition to somatization, hostility, the contrasts of the other
   scores are statistical (P<0.05). In EPQ, In E items, the score the
   psychological commissioners got is higher than the other freshmen. While
   in L item, the score is lower (P<0.01). As those psychological
   commissioners' mental health, only the contrast of phobic anxiety is
   statistical between male and female (P<0.01). To the students of
   different majors, those scores have no obvious differences (P>0.05). In
   EPQ, As those psychological commissioners' personality, the score in P
   item that the female got is lower than that the male got, while in E N L
   items, the scores are higher than those the male got. Score in L is
   statistical (P<0.01). Those scores in PENL have no obvious differences
   in different majors (P>0.05). Conclusions: The psychological
   commissioners' mental healthy level is obviously better than other
   students. The personality characteristics of the psychological
   commissioners are suitable for the mental health education. There is no
   big difference of mental health and personality characteristics of
   psychological commissioners among different group members. All these
   results remind us that the choosing standard is very important when we
   choose the psychological commissioners. Furthermore, we should
   strengthen the psychological commissioners training.},

Abstract = {BackgroundMedical students face significant challenges with depression,
   where psychological flexibility and meaning in life serve as protective
   factors that can mitigate the worsening of depressive symptoms. This
   study employs a two-wave panel design to explore the dynamic
   relationships among psychological flexibility, meaning in life, and
   depression in medical students.MethodsThe study utilized panel data from
   two time points, tracking 1,837 medical students over a 12-week
   interval. Measurement tools included a demographic information form, the
   Acceptance and Commitment Therapy Comprehensive Assessment
   Questionnaire, the Meaning in Life Questionnaire, and the Center for
   Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Descriptive analysis,
   correlation analysis, and cross-lagged analysis were conducted on the
   variables.ResultsA relationship was found between higher levels of
   psychological flexibility and lower levels of depression. Autoregressive
   models indicated that all three variables showed significant stability
   over time. Cross-lagged analysis found that higher psychological
   flexibility at Time 1 was associated with lower depression at Time 2,
   but meaning in life was not associated with subsequent depression. In
   contrast, higher depression at Time 1 was associated with lower
   subsequent psychological flexibility and meaning in life. Additionally,
   gender did not have a significant association with these
   variables.ConclusionThis study underscores the unique advantages of
   universities in the mental health education of medical students. It
   recommends enhancing psychological flexibility and meaning in life
   through mindfulness training, emotional regulation courses, and
   professional values education to effectively prevent the onset of
   depression.Clinical trial numberNot applicable.},

Title = {RETRACTED: Research on Mental Health Monitoring Scheme of Migrant
   Children Based on Convolutional Neural Network Based on Deep Learning

Abstract = {In recent years, with the acceleration of urbanization and the
   implementation of compulsory education, the pressure on students' study
   and life has increased, and the phenomenon of psychological and
   behavioral problems has become increasingly prominent. Therefore, the
   school has regarded students' mental health education as the top
   priority in teaching work. Effective expression classification can
   assist psychology researchers to study psychology and other disciplines
   and analyze children's psychological activities and mental states by
   classifying expressions, thereby reducing the occurrence of
   psychological behavior problems. Most of the current mainstream methods
   focus on the exploration of text explicit features and the optimization
   of representation models, and few works pay attention to deeper language
   expressions. Metaphors, as language expressions often used in daily
   life, are closely related to an individual's emotion, cognition, and
   psychological state. This paper studies children's smiling face
   recognition based on deep neural network. In order to obtain a better
   identification effect of mental health problems of children, this paper
   attempts to use multisource data, including consumption data, access
   control data, network logs, and grade data, and proposes a multisource
   data-based mental health problem identification algorithm. The main
   research focus is feature extraction, trying to use one-dimensional
   convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) to mine students' online patterns
   from online behavior sequences, calculate abnormal scores based on
   students' consumption data in the cafeteria, and describe the dietary
   differences among students. At the same time, this paper uses the
   students' psychological state data provided by the psychological center
   as a label to improve the deficiencies caused by the questionnaire. This
   paper uses the training set to train five common classification
   algorithms, evaluates them through the validation set, and selects the
   best classifier as our algorithm and uses it to identify students with
   mental health problems in the test set. The experimental results show
   that precision reaches 0.68, recall reaches 0.56, and F1-measure reaches
   0.67.},

Title = {Inequitable access to mental healthcare for socially excluded
   adolescents},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY},

Volume = {70},

Abstract = {Background: Adolescence is a critical period for mental health and
   social exclusion, a key social determinant of mental health. Early
   intervention approaches are key to mitigating the impact of mental
   ill-health during adolescence, however social exclusion can create
   additional barriers to accessing care.Aim: We aimed to better understand
   help-seeking experiences of adolescents facing co-occurring social
   exclusion and mental ill-health, including sources of support, barriers
   and preferences for service provision.Method: Cross-sectional data were
   analysed, from the 2022 Mission Australia Youth Survey (N = 18,800).
   Adolescents aged 15 to 19 years were recruited from around Australia,
   through schools, community organisations and digital platforms. Indices
   of four domains of social exclusion (housing, finances, relational and
   education/employment) were created using existing Youth Survey
   variables, and supplemented with demographic characteristics,
   psychological distress and help-seeking behaviours (perceived need,
   mental health supports, barriers to access and preferences).
   Relationships between social exclusion domains, mental health concerns
   and help-seeking behaviours were explored using logistic regression
   models.Results: A total of 9,743 young people reported having needed
   mental health support, yet only 58.1\% reportedly sought support (n =
   5,565). Social exclusion domains were associated with different
   help-seeking behaviours: housing challenges with higher help-seeking (OR
   = 1.28; 95\% CI {[}1.15, 1.42]); relational difficulties and
   edu-employment issues with lower (OR = 0.75; 95\% CI {[}0.68, 0.83] and
   OR = 0.82; 95\% CI {[}0.75, 0.89]). Stigma, confidentiality concerns,
   cost and not knowing where to seek help were common barriers to
   help-seeking; those experiencing social exclusion more likely to report
   these. Participants reported a strong preference for face-to-face
   support.Conclusions: This study highlights the additional needs and
   challenges faced by adolescents dealing with both social exclusion and
   mental ill-health. With greater barriers to help-seeking, concerted
   efforts are needed to reduce stigma, improve mental health literacy and
   increase access to trusted information sources. Further initiatives
   should focus on structural factors that socially exclude young people
   and exacerbate inequitable access to mental healthcare.},

Title = {Methamphetamine use awareness, prevalence and socio-demographic risk
   factors among in-school adolescents in Ebonyi state, Nigeria},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN},
Year = {2025},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Methamphetamine (MA) use is on the rise in Nigeria with the dire
   consequences to the adolescent's mental health, education, and society.
   Despite the pervasiveness and accessibility of the drug, relatively
   little research has examined in-school adolescents. Our study explored
   in-school adolescents MA use awareness, sources of information,
   prevalence and socio-demographic risk factors. A cross-sectional
   analytical design was applied, drawing on data from in-school
   adolescents between the ages of 10 and 19 in Ebonyi state. The
   participants were recruited using a multistage sampling procedure, while
   a semi-structured questionnaire was used for data collection.
   Percentages were used to analyze data on MA use awareness, sources of
   information, and prevalence, while multivariable logistic regression
   adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were used to analyze the association between
   socio-demographic risk factors and MA use. The level of significance was
   set at P < 0.05. The results reveal that the majority of in-school
   adolescents have MA use awareness (95.1 \%). Social media,
   {[}Facebook/WhatsApp] were the most prominent sources of information
   (93.2 \%). The lifetime prevalence of MA use was 19.2 \%, past year 19.9
   \%, past month 23.5 \%, and past week 7.8 \%. The adjusted odds ratios
   (aORs) for socio-factors show peer pressure/friends was 3.22 times (P<
   0.05) more likely than others to predict MA use. Demographic factors
   show that on-campus adolescents were 3.7 times, off-campus 4.23 times
   (P< 0.05) more likely than family house to predict MA. Being polygamous
   was 2.28 times, single parent 2.92 times more likely than being
   monogamous to predict MA, (P< 0.05). Being a traditional worshiper was
   9.52 times less likely than being Christian, (P< 0.05), while being
   Muslim had no association with MA use (P< 0.05).These findings highlight
   the potential of adopting a multi-sectorial approach to tackle MA use,
   including social media use intervention, parental monitoring/support,
   therapists for risk behaviour counseling, scale-up school-based
   intervention policy/laws for early use prevention.},

Journal = {EVIDENCE-BASED MENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {20},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Background WHO's mental health gap action programme intervention guide
   (mhGAP-IG) is an evidence-based tool aimed at front-line health workers
   in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Its potential to
   improve global mental health education, especially through digital
   technologies, has been little studied. Problem-based learning (PBL) is
   usually conducted face-to-face, but its remote application could
   facilitate cross-cultural education.
   Objective To evaluate PBL, applied to peer-to-peer global mental health
   e-learning (Aqoon), using mhGAP-IG.
   Methods Twelve pairs of UK and Somaliland medical students completed the
   full programme. Participants self-directedly met online, via the
   low-bandwidth Medicine Africa website, for PBL-style tutorials focused
   on modules of the mhGAP-IG, V.2.0. Preparticipation and
   postparticipation surveys used mixed methods to evaluate Aqoon,
   including the Attitudes Toward Psychiatry (ATP-30) instrument.
   Findings Median ATP-30 scores for Somaliland (82.0 vs 95.0, p=0.003) and
   UK students (82.0 vs 95.0, p=0.011) improved significantly following
   Aqoon. Qualitative feedback showed that participants valued peer
   connectivity and learning about cultural and psychosocial differences in
   their partner's country. Somaliland students were motivated by clinical
   learning and UK students by global health education. Feedback on the PBL
   structure was positive.
   Conclusions Digital PBL represents an innovative method to extend the
   benefits of mhGAP-IG beyond front-line clinical staff, to healthcare
   students in LMICs.
   Clinical implications Educational resource limitations in LMICs may be
   overcome using digital platforms and PBL. Replication with non-medical
   healthcare students is the next step for this model to explore Aqoon's
   relevance to pressing global mental health workforce challenges.},

Abstract = {Parenting quality is important in child development. In the presence of
   HIV poverty and life stress, parenting may be challenged and child
   development affected. This study examines cross-sectional associations
   of situational factors such as poverty, mental health, HIV status,
   living with a biological parent, and stigma with good parenting and
   child outcomes (n = 989; age = 4-13 years) within the Child Community
   Care study (South Africa and Malawi). A parenting measure was created
   from 10 variables comprising 6 child and 4 parent ratings. These were
   highly correlated. Total parenting score was generated on a 10-point
   continuous scale, with a good parenting cut-off then defined as >= 8 out
   of a possible 10. Five factors were associated with good parenting.
   Positively associated with good parenting were being the biological
   parent of the child, parental mental health and dwelling in households
   with multiple adults. Poverty and stigma were negatively associated with
   good parenting. Using multiple mediation analysis, a positive direct
   effect of good parenting was found on child self-esteem, child behaviour
   and educational risks with a partial mediation via child depression and
   trauma. These data highlight possible intervention points. Influences on
   parenting could be seen through being the biological parent, parental
   mental health, poverty and stigma. In these challenging environments,
   health, nutrition, mental health, education and treatment to keep
   parents alive are all clearly identified as potential pathways to ensure
   child well-being.},

Title = {Mental health educational programs in schools: Experiences, needs and

Journal = {ENCEPHALE-REVUE DE PSYCHIATRIE CLINIQUE BIOLOGIQUE ET THERAPEUTIQUE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {45},

Abstract = {Aims. - This study explores the experiences and expectations of young
   adults concerning mental health educational programs in schools. The
   scarcity of these programs leads us to deepen students' perspective in
   order to boost the establishment of such sessions. Indeed, this type of
   prevention plan can improve the access to care and reduce the impact of
   such disorders.
   Methodology. - We have developed a standardized questionnaire to be
   filled online by students between the ages of 18 and 25 years, reached
   using Facebook pages of student associations of universities from
   different regions of France.
   Results. - From the 3rd to the 20th of July 2017, 1852 students filled
   in the questionnaire. In total, 1672 (90\%) of the young adults had not
   experienced mental health educational programs in their school career.
   However, 1652 (90\%) requested that these programs be a part of their
   academic career. The majority of the young adults (n = 590, 56\%) would
   have chosen a psychologist as leader for these programs, preferably (>
   80\%) in a discussion around a difficult imaginary situation, using
   role-playing or a board game. Furthermore, 1067 (57\%) young adults
   reported having felt the need to talk to someone about mental health
   during their school career.
   Conclusion. - This exploratory study highlights the lack of mental
   health educational programs in schools and the need expressed by
   students themselves. It suggests directions to think about how to
   develop these mental health preventive programs, evoking their limits
   and advantages. (C) 2019 L'Encephale, Paris.},

Title = {Attitudes of psychologists and nurses toward suicide and suicide
   prevention in Ghana: A qualitative study},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {49},
Number = {6},
Pages = {691-700},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background: One way of preventing suicide has been increasing awareness
   among health care professionals of their own attitudes and taboos toward
   suicide and its prevention.
   Objective: The purpose of this study was to understand the attitudes of
   health professionals toward suicidal behavior and its prevention in
   Ghana.
   Methods: A total of 17 informants (9 clinical psychologists and 8
   emergency ward nurses) in an urban center were interviewed using a
   semi-structured interview guide. Interpretative Phenomenological
   Analysis (IPA) was used to analyze the data.
   Results: We found that the attitudes of these health workers toward
   suicide and suicide prevention seemed to be transiting between morality
   and mental health. The psychologists generally saw suicide as a mental
   health issue, emphasized a caring and empathic view of suicidal persons
   and approached suicide prevention from a health-service point of view.
   Mental health education and improvements in primary health care were
   reported as practical approaches toward suicide prevention. The nurses
   on the other hand, held a moralistic attitude toward suicide as a crime,
   viewed suicide persons as blameworthy and approached suicide prevention
   from a proscriptive perspective. Informal approaches such as talking to
   people, strengthening the legal code against suicide and threatening
   suicidal persons with the religious consequences of the act were also
   indicated as practical approaches to suicide prevention. Educational
   level, clinical experience with suicidal persons, and religious values,
   are discussed as influencing the differences in attitudes toward suicide
   and suicide prevention between psychologists and nurses.
   Conclusion: Health workers in Ghana need training in suicidology to
   improve both knowledge and skills relevant for suicide prevention. (C)

Title = {Effects of a flexibly delivered group-based acceptance and commitment
   therapy on reducing stress and enhancing psychological wellbeing in
   parents of school-age children during the COVID-19 pandemic: a
   quasi-experimental study},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Month = {DEC 12},
Abstract = {Introduction COVID-19 has increased parental stress and significantly
   impacted the psychological well-being of individuals, especially parents
   of school-age children. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy posits that
   individuals can accept their unchangeable inner experiences (thoughts
   and feelings) while acting in ways aligned with their personal values,
   demonstrating effectiveness in reducing stress and improving
   psychological well-being, especially among parents of children with
   chronic illness. This study aimed to test the effectiveness of a
   group-based ACT, delivered flexibly, in improving stress and
   psychological well-being in parents with school-age children, regardless
   of their children's chronic conditions, within a real-world
   context.Methods This quasi-experimental study recruited parents with
   school-age children, through convenience sampling from the Christian
   Family Service Centre in Hong Kong. The group-based Acceptance and
   Commitment Therapy intervention consisted of five weekly sessions
   delivered via face-to-face meetings and online videoconferencing,
   consistent with participants' preferences and COVID-19 related
   restrictions in Hong Kong. Paired t-tests and Generalized Estimating
   Equations following the intention-to-treat principle were used to
   examine the overall effects and the moderating effects of delivery
   methods.Results The study included 250 parents, with an average age of
   40.90 years, mostly women. The average age of their youngest child was
   7.68 years. In line with COVID-19-related restrictions and participants'
   preferences, 109 parents participated in online sessions, while 141
   attended face-to-face sessions. Results showed significant
   small-to-medium improvements in various outcome variables after the
   intervention, including parental stress (Cohen's d = 0.26), general
   stress (d = 0.18), depressive symptoms (d = 0.18), mental health
   literacy (d = 0.43), subjective wellbeing (d = 0.25), and psychological
   flexibility (d = 0.28). Notably, the online videoconferencing format was
   found to be as effective as the face-to-face format, with similar
   session attendance rates.Conclusion The findings highlight the potential
   of group-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy to alleviate stress and
   improve psychological well-being in parents of school-age children,
   regardless of the delivery method, especially during crises such as the
   COVID-19 pandemic. However, due to limitations in the study design,
   caution is warranted when interpreting the overall effects of
   group-based ACT on parent outcomes and the moderating role of delivery
   methods. Further research is needed to validate these findings and
   explore the nuances of delivery methods in similar real-world
   situations.},

Title = {Working together to improve the mental health of indigenous children: A
   systematic review},
Journal = {CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {104},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Objective: This review analyses the available literature that underpins
   intersectoral service integration processes and tools designed to
   improve mental healthcare for Indigenous children.
   Method: 10 databases and 12 grey literature sources were searched for
   publications in English and published between 1 January 2008 and 31
   December 2017 that evaluated or measured primary health care
   interventions that focussed on the intersectoral integration of
   services, service partnerships, or action across at least two sectors to
   improve children's mental health, and that included Indigenous children
   4-17 years old in one of the five CANNZUS countries (Canada, Australia,
   New Zealand, Norway and/or the United States). The five sectors
   considered were PHC, specialist mental health, education, child
   protection, and juvenile justice. Study characteristics were extracted
   and reported aims, strategies, enablers, and outcomes were identified
   and analysed.
   Results: Eleven studies were included: five were Australian; four
   Canadian; one from the USA; and one from New Zealand. Nine key
   strategies for service integration were: intervention delivery through
   community workers and external workers, interdisciplinary delivery,
   staff and organizational capacity building, engaging community,
   empowering families, individual counselling, adaption of care to
   Indigenous sociocultural specificities, and strengthening culture and
   identity. Six enablers of implementation were: involvement of community,
   access and cost, collaborative multidisciplinary health services, strong
   relationships, cultural sensitivity, and organizational and staff
   capacity. Six outcomes were: health and human services collaboration,
   psychosocial functioning and stress management, health service \&
   organizational empowerment, development and promotion of appropriate
   health policy and protocols, linkage of health services, and community
   and family empowerment.
   Discussion and conclusion: The evidence for intersectoral interventions
   addressing Indigenous child mental health is in the early stages of
   development, but suggests potential for improving health outcomes for
   Indigenous children, their families and communities, as well as the
   satisfaction and utilization of healthcare and community services.
   Further research surrounding cost evaluation, impact on the social
   determinants of health, extent of consumer engagement, and Indigenous
   voice is needed.},

Title = {Australian adolescents' beliefs and help-seeking intentions towards
   peers experiencing symptoms of depression and alcohol misuse},
Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Month = {AUG 16},
Abstract = {Background: Many young people are reluctant to seek professional help
   for mental health problems, preferring to rely on their friends for
   support. It is therefore important to ensure that adolescents can
   identify signs of psychological distress in their peers, talk to them
   about these, and help them access appropriate services when necessary.
   The current study examined adolescents' ability to recognise symptoms of
   depression and alcohol misuse, perceived barriers to help-seeking, and
   their intentions to encourage a peer to seek help from a range of
   informal and formal help sources.
   Method: The current study used baseline data from a randomised
   controlled trial of a school-based intervention that teaches adolescents
   how to overcome barriers to accessing professional help for mental
   health and substance use problems (MAKINGtheLINK). Participants (n =
   2456) were presented with two vignettes portraying depression and
   alcohol misuse, respectively, and were asked to identify the problems
   described. Participants provided data on their past help-seeking
   behaviour, confidence to help a peer, perceived barriers to
   help-seeking, and intentions to encourage a peer to seek help.
   Results: Health professionals were the main source of help that
   participants had relied on for depressive symptoms, followed by friends
   and parents. In contrast, friends were the main source of help that
   participants had relied on for alcohol and other drug problems, followed
   by health professionals and parents. Just over half of the sample
   correctly identified the problems described in the two vignettes,
   although the majority of participants were confident that they could
   talk to a peer and help them seek professional help if needed. Most
   agreed that the vignettes described problems that warranted professional
   help, however approximately half the sample was unsure or considered it
   unlikely that they would seek help if they experienced similar problems.
   For both disorders, participants were most likely to encourage a peer to
   seek help from their family, followed by formal help sources and
   friends.
   Conclusions: While the results point towards a greater willingness to
   approach formal help sources, particularly for depression, peers remain
   an important source of support for young people experiencing mental
   health and substance use problems.},

Journal = {COMPREHENSIVE PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2024},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has wrought a profound impact on
   mental health in Sub- Saharan Africa, exacerbating existing disparities
   and rendering individuals undergoing treatment particularly susceptible.
   This comprehensive critical review delves into the scope, nature, and
   extent of COVID-19 impact on mental health services in Sub- Saharan
   Africa, while concurrently elucidating pivotal lessons and exemplary
   practices learnt from periods of lockdown. Methods: The methodology was
   guided by Jesson \& Laccy's guide on how to conduct critical literature
   reviews. Articles were comprehensively sought through two academic
   databases (PubMed and Google Scholar), complemented by targeted searches
   on the WHO website and official public health websites of relevant
   Sub-Saharan African countries. Results: The investigation reveals a
   surge in mental health challenges, notably marked by a significant
   escalation in anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder.
   Disruptions to care services, financial hardships, and the pervasive
   effects of social isolation further compound this escalation. The
   pre-existing inequalities in access to and quality of care were
   accentuated during this crisis, with marginalized groups encountering
   heightened impediments to essential services. In navigating this
   unprecedented challenge, communities emerged as integral agents in
   establishing supportive networks and implementing culturally sensitive
   interventions. Technology, such as telemedicine and online resources,
   played a pivotal role in bridging access gaps, particularly in remote
   areas. The synthesis of best practices for supporting mental health
   patients during lockdowns encompasses targeted interventions for
   vulnerable groups, including adolescents and pregnant women. Empowering
   communities through economic support and mental health literacy programs
   was identified as crucial. The integration of technology, such as the
   development of robust telemedicine frameworks, virtual training in
   curricula, and the utilization of digital platforms for interventions
   and public messaging, emerged as a cornerstone in addressing access
   disparities. Community engagement and resilience-building strategies
   gained prominence, emphasizing the necessity of collaboration between
   healthcare providers and communities. Promotion of peer support groups,
   home-based care, and the preservation of traditional healing practices
   were underscored as essential components. Conclusion: The study
   underscores the need to adapt and optimize mental health services during
   emergencies. This entails prioritizing mental health within emergency
   response frameworks, exploring alternative service delivery methods, and
   fortifying data collection and research efforts.},

Title = {Emotional and mental health competences in Spanish textbooks in Primary
   Education},
Journal = {REVISTA COMPLUTENSE DE EDUCACION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {31},

Abstract = {Introduction: the development of competencies in compulsory education,
   specifically those concerned with the emotions, constitutes an
   opportunity to include those learnings considered to be essential.
   Textbooks are excellent pedagogical material, which give a glimpse of
   the content which is presented in the classroom. The aim of this work
   was to evaluate the treatment of the competencies in mental and
   emotional health in natural science textbooks in Primary Education in
   Spain. Methodology: the sample was made up of texts for Primary
   Education from the three publishers with the highest distribution in
   Spain. A descriptive analysis was carried out of the competency-related
   contents necessary for the development of the aforementioned
   competencies. Results: results evidence a predominant presence of
   informative and preventive contents, followed by those related to
   personal development. A smaller presence of contents related to the
   environment and social development was also found. This research has
   focused on conceptual contents. In this sense, those related to the
   protection of mental health and to the most frequent problems associated
   with it, as well as its risk factors, have received special attention.
   Attitudinal and procedural contents were approached in a much more
   limited way, despite the fact that some of the texts dealt with empathy,
   self-esteem, conflict resolution and the ability to communicate and to
   establish interpersonal relationships. Discussion and conclusions: the
   absence of contents aimed at promoting stress-management skills,
   assertiveness and the application of self-control strategies evidenced
   insufficiencies to develop mental and emotional heath competences. The
   omission of these contents within the textbooks could potentially
   represent a limitation for the teacher who uses exclusively these
   resources. However, given the ultimate goal of this educational area, it
   should be noted that its health focus stands out positively insofar it
   goes beyond its biological meaning. It would be advisable to design
   complementary materials that approach the procedural and attitudinal
   dimensions required to acquire the cited competences.},

Title = {Early intervention for children and young people with neurodevelopmental
   conditions and intellectual disability: ``The Getting Help{''} offer for
   Northwest England},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN AUTISM},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {10},

Pages = {221-235},
Month = {NOV 20},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to outline what early support
   should be offered to children and young people with neurodevelopmental
   conditions including those who are autistic or have intellectual
   disability. A review of all child and adolescent mental health services
   (CAMHS) services in the Northwest completed by NHS England and
   Improvement (Doyle and Ryan, 2021) found that there was no clear Tier 2
   offer (for mild to moderate mental health issues) for autistic children
   and young people or for those with intellectual disability. Following
   this review, a project group that had developed a model for mental
   health services for autistic children and young people and for those
   with intellectual disability (Wee et al., 2021) was tasked with
   articulating the ``Getting Help{''} offer for children and young people
   with neurodevelopmental conditions, including intellectual disability.
   Design/methodology/approach - A working group was created consisting of
   professionals from mental health, education and local authority and
   lived experience representatives of coproduction partners. A brief
   review of the background literature was also conducted. Six meetings
   were held to create a framework for the ``Getting Help{''} offer and to
   discuss what the offer should be based on professional expertise and
   lived experience. Findings - Recommendations for the Getting Help
   multi-agency offer included pre- and post-assessment support as part of
   a single attention deficit hyperactivity
   disorder/autism/neurodevelopmental pathway, community support for
   children with intellectual disability, access to adapted mental health
   support and the need for early recognition and support for avoidant and
   restrictive food intake disorder. Key themes from working group
   discussions included the reduction in the quality of services
   experienced by children and families due to silo working, which
   increased the risk of falling between multi-agency services and led to
   early signs of neurodevelopmental needs, or mental health issues being
   missed. Another theme was aiming for equity of access and outcomes.
   Originality/value - This work is a response to a coproduced review of
   CAMHS in the Northwest and incorporates the lived experience of young
   people and families. It also adopts a holistic multi-agency
   neurodevelopmental approach rather than focusing on a single diagnosis
   or service.},

Abstract = {BackgroundIn a world confronted with new and connected challenges, novel
   strategies are needed to help children and adults achieve their full
   potential, to predict, prevent and treat disease, and to achieve equity
   in services and outcomes. Australia's Generation Victoria (GenV) cohorts
   are designed for multi-pronged discovery (what could improve outcomes?)
   and intervention research (what actually works, how much and for whom?).
   Here, we describe the key features of its protocol.MethodsGenV is a
   whole-population longitudinal platform open to all approximate to
   150,000 children born within a two-year window and residing in the state
   of Victoria and their parents. GenV is guided by its 6 principles of
   Inclusivity, Collaboration, Sustainability, Enhancement, Systematised
   Processes and Value and enabled by large-scale biobanking, IT and novel
   high-throughput technology infrastructure. Successive recruitment phases
   were designed to maximise GenV's inclusivity: (1) a smaller Advance
   Cohort from December 2020; (2) Newborn recruitment, with presence in 58
   Victorian maternity services supporting face-to-face approach to parents
   of babies born 4 October 2021-3 October 2023; (3) Intensive remote
   recruitment to mid-2024 targeting those missed around birth; and (4)
   Ongoing indefinite enrolment of in-age children and their parents.
   Participants consent to universal (1) data linkage (e.g., state and
   federal physical and mental health, education, social, geospatial,
   ecological); (2) biosamples storage and use (e.g., residual clinical
   pregnancy and newborn screening, GenV-collected perinatal parent/infant
   saliva); (3) phenotypic and biosamples collection waves at child ages 6,
   11 and 16 years, likely in schools and remotely for parents; and (4)
   opportunities for collaborative research integrated into GenV as a
   population registry (e.g., trials, natural experiments, depth
   subcohorts). Many participants supplement universal data with additional
   biosamples (e.g., infant stool, breast milk) and brief digital remote
   `GenV and Me' assessments over the first 5 years. GenV will make all
   research data available, adhering to the principles of Open
   Science.DiscussionLaunched in the COVID-19 pandemic and committed to
   diversity and inclusivity, GenV's parallel consented child and
   pre-midlife cohorts will be positioned to help address today's pressing
   issues such as chronic mental and physical health conditions, inequity,
   public health crises such as pandemics, and climate harm.Trial

Abstract = {BackgroundAutism and ADHD are heritable, co-occurrent, and associated
   with difficulties with executive functioning (cognitive and
   self-regulation skills which enable us to set and work toward goals).
   Executive function difficulties, and their negative impacts across
   cognitive, health and social domains, extend to individuals with
   first-degree relatives who are autistic or have ADHD, even if they do
   not meet thresholds for a clinical diagnosis themselves. Supporting
   executive function development in children with elevated autism traits,
   or a first-degree relative with autism or ADHD, addresses community
   priorities for early support to help achieve the best mental health,
   education and life outcomes.MethodsThis study will evaluate the
   feasibility and acceptability of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of
   a parent-toddler programme entitled ``Supporting Toddlers with a
   connection to autism or ADHD to develop strong Attention, Regulation and
   Thinking skills{''} (START). START is a neurodiversity-affirming
   programme, co-refined through extensive Patient and Public Involvement.
   Sixty parent-child dyads, in Oxford or Southampton (UK), will be
   randomized using Sealed Envelope by a researcher not involved in
   recruitment, delivery or outcome data collection to receive START or
   usual practice, on a 1:1 ratio. Children (20 months old) will be
   assessed using questionnaires completed by the parent (not blind to
   allocation) post-intervention (within 2 weeks of the end of the active
   intervention wave, when children are aged 27-31 months), and using
   parent questionnaires and a battery of executive function measures
   administered by researchers blind to allocation at baseline and
   follow-up (36 months old). START will be delivered in small groups to 30
   parent-child dyads, in community settings.DiscussionWe will assess the
   feasibility of recruiting eligible participants to the study, the
   reliability of measures of implementation fidelity and degree of
   implementation fidelity achieved, the appropriateness of proposed
   outcome and mechanism measures, the acceptability of an RCT of the
   programme, parental adherence to the programme, logistics of programme
   delivery, and the acceptability of START, using mixed-method measures of
   engagement and satisfaction. Results will inform the design and
   implementation of a definitive RCT of START, and yield broader insights
   into the delivery and evaluation of complex early-years interventions in
   community settings.Trial registrationISRCTN registry ISRCTN99820028

   Psychometric Evaluation Among Mothers of Children With Intellectual

Journal = {NURSING RESEARCH AND PRACTICE},

Volume = {2025},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Aim: Mothers of children with intellectual disabilities are particularly
   vulnerable to mental distress due to demanding and exhausting
   caregiving. However, in the Arab world, they are seldom screened for
   depression because of limited diagnostic resources. Addressing the
   urgent need for brief and reliable screening tools, this study evaluated
   the psychometric properties of the Arabic version of the Patient Health
   Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) among 85 Saudi mothers. Design: A
   cross-sectional study. Methods: The construct, convergent, and divergent
   validity of the PHQ-2 was examined through a latent variable model
   (LVM), while its cutoff score was examined through receiver-operating
   characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results: The unidimensional PHQ-2
   (item loadings > 0.7) was positively predicted by stress and negatively
   predicted by high mood and happiness, supporting its convergent and
   divergent validity. The PHQ-2 effectively predicted low mood, poor sleep
   quality, nightmares, high stress, low general physical health, and
   willingness to join a psychological support program (area under the
   curve {[}AUC] range = 0.72-0.84, p values < 0.001). The best balance
   between sensitivity and specificity was achieved at the PHQ-2 threshold
   >= 2.5, while the cutoff >= 3.5 demonstrated a higher positive
   predictive value (PPV) for all outcomes (range = 30.0-78.8 vs.
   23.0-70.8). Conclusions: The PHQ-2 is a brief, valid tool, which at
   cutoffs >= 2.5 and >= 3.5 can reliably detect clinically significant
   depression and related psychological and physical adverse effects.
   Mothers scoring >= 3.5 may require a clinician-based examination for
   depression, and they may benefit from specific mental health literacy
   interventions. However, the results should be interpreted with caution
   given convenience sampling, a small sample size, and elevated distress
   levels in the current population. These limitations highlight the need
   to replicate the study with larger, randomly selected samples from more
   diverse populations. Implications for Practice: Nurses can efficiently
   screen for depression and its mental/physical sequelae, as well as
   monitor response to treatment using only two items. The study provided
   two well-interpreted cutoffs of the PHQ-2, with real-world implications
   for mental health screening in under-resourced settings. Reporting
   Method: The study adhered to STROBE guidelines. Patient or Public
   Contribution: No patient or public contribution.},

Title = {Physical activity and internalization problems in middle school
   students: the chain mediating role of rumination thinking and peer
   acceptance},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {This study explores methods to improve internalizing problems in middle
   school students through physical exercise, aiming to construct a
   mediational model that includes physical exercise, Rumination, peer
   acceptance, and internalizing problems. The model examines the
   interactions and influence pathways among these variables to provide a
   more comprehensive understanding of the mechanism through which physical
   exercise impacts internalizing problems in middle school students. 671
   junior high school students were surveyed by physical exercise scale,
   Rumination scale, peer acceptance scale and internalization question
   scale. SPSS26.0 was used to analyze the data, followed by descriptive
   analysis, reliability analysis, Pearson correlation analysis, Harman
   single factor test and Bootstrap analysis. (1) Physical exercise was
   negatively correlated with internalizing problems (r = - 0.286), but the
   direct path between physical exercise and internalizing problems was not
   statistically significant (beta = - 0.060, p > 0.05, CI {[}- 0.137,
   0.018]); (2) Physical exercise was significantly negatively correlated
   with Rumination (beta = - 0.174, p < 0.001, CI {[}- 0.255, - 0.094]) and
   significantly positively correlated with peer acceptance (beta = 0.357,
   p < 0.001, CI {[}0.286, 0.429]). Rumination was significantly negatively
   correlated with peer acceptance (beta = - 0.128, p < 0.001, CI {[}-
   0.199, - 0.056]) and significantly positively correlated with
   internalizing problems (beta = 0.289, p < 0.001, CI {[}0.222, 0.356]);
   peer acceptance was significantly negatively correlated with
   internalizing problems (beta = - 0.372, p < 0.001, CI {[}- 0.448, -
   0.296]). (3) The total effect of the chain mediation model was - 0.251,
   and the direct effect of physical exercise and internalized problems was
   - 0.059,The total effect accounted for 23.51\%, Rumination and Peer
   acceptance played a mediating role between physical exercise and
   internalized behavior problems, and the total indirect effect size was -
   0.192, The total effect accounted for 76.49\%. The mediating effect
   values of Rumination and Peer acceptance between physical exercise and
   internalized behavior problems were - 0.050 and - 0.133, accounting for
   19.92\% and 52.99\%, respectively. The chain-mediated effect between
   Rumination and Peer acceptance between physical exercise and
   internalized behavior problems was - 0.008, and the chain-mediated
   effect accounted for 3.19\%. Physical exercise is negatively correlated
   with internalization, Rumination is negatively correlated with peer
   acceptance; Rumination and peer acceptance, as mediating variables, not
   only play an independent mediating role between physical exercise and
   junior high school students' internalization problems, but also further
   strengthen their role in junior high school students' internalization
   problems through chain mediation. Although the effect value of chain
   mediation is small, it is worthy of attention, suggesting that there is
   a synergistic effect among the variables. The results of this study
   provide an important reference for the design of school physical
   exercise curriculum. Through reasonable design of physical education
   curriculum, the interest and attraction of physical exercise can be
   increased, and the participation of students can be improved indirectly,
   thus promoting the improvement of internalization problems.
   At the same time, it can be considered to combine physical exercise with
   mental health education, and cultivate students' methods and abilities
   to cope with pressure and negative emotions through physical exercise
   courses, cultivate positive and optimistic attitude, and improve junior
   middle school students' mental toughness and social adaptability.},

Title = {Statistical analysis of mental influencing factors for anxiety and
   depression of rural and urban freshmen},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Month = {DEC 22},
Abstract = {The freshmen stage is a high incidence period for psychological issues.
   With the increasing gap between urban and rural areas in China, the
   mental problems of rural freshmen are more prominent in recent years due
   to the huge contrast of campus life with their growth environment and
   other reasons. The concern for the mental well-being of both rural and
   urban freshman students prompted our comprehensive five-year study
   (2018-2022) on psychological issues in a group of 12,564 first-year
   students from dozens of public universities in Shandong province. The
   investigation employed PPS (probability proportional to size) sampling
   and was conducted near the the end of the first semester. Using the data
   gathered, we analyzed and compared the indicators of psychological
   problems in rural and urban freshmen by Duncan's Multiple Range Test. We
   also conducted a canonical correlation analysis and pathway analysis to
   examine the psychological factors that contribute to anxiety and
   depression in both rural and urban freshmen. According to the findings,
   rural freshmen exhibit significantly higher levels of anxiety and
   depression than their urban counterparts. Inferiority, obsession, and
   internet addiction were identified as the primary influencing factors of
   anxiety and depression in both rural and urban freshmen. Social phobia
   was found to be a significant influencing factor for anxiety in rural
   freshmen, while bigotry was identified as a specific influencing factor
   for urban freshmen. Furthermore, the results of the path analysis
   suggest that anxiety plays a crucial role as a mediating factor between
   the main influencing factors and depression. These results substantially
   extend former research in this area and have important implications for
   the development of effective intervention strategies to address anxiety
   and depression. According to these results, policymakers should assess
   and intervene of anxiety and depression as a whole, and provide mental
   health education according to main effect factors of freshmen from rural
   and urban areas. Detailed policy recommendations are in discussion and
   conclusion.},

Title = {Integrating care for individuals with FASD: results from a
   multi-stakeholder symposium},
Journal = {BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {15},
Month = {OCT 5},
Abstract = {Background: Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) has a significant
   impact on communities and systems such as health, education, justice and
   social services. FASD is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that
   results in permanent disabilities and associated service needs that
   change across affected individuals' lifespans. There is a degree of
   interdependency among medical and non-medical providers across these
   systems that do not frequently meet or plan a coordinated continuum of
   care. Improving overall care integration will increase provider-specific
   and system capacity, satisfaction, quality of life and outcomes.
   Methods: We conducted a consensus generating symposium comprised of 60
   experts from different stakeholder groups: Allied \& Mental Health,
   Education, First Nations \& Metis Health, Advocates, Primary Care,
   Government Health Policy, Regional FASD Coordinators, Social Services,
   and Youth Justice. Research questions addressed barriers and solutions
   to integration across systems and group-specific and system-wide
   research priorities. Solutions and consensus on prioritized lists were
   generated by combining the Electronic Meeting System approach with a
   modified ` Nominal Group Technique'.
   Results: FASD capacity (e.g., training, education, awareness) needs to
   be increased in both medical and non-medical providers. Outcomes and
   integration will be improved by implementing: multidisciplinary primary
   care group practice models, FASD system navigators/advocates, and
   patient centred medical homes. Electronic medical records that are
   accessible to multiple medical and non-medical providers are a key tool
   to enhancing integration and quality. Eligibility criteria for services
   are a main barrier to integration across systems. There is a need for
   culturally and community-specific approaches for First Nations
   communities.
   Conclusions: There is a need to better integrate care for individuals
   and families living with FASD. Primary Care is well positioned to play a
   central and important role in facilitating and supporting increased
   integration. Research is needed to better address best practices (e.g.,
   interventions, supports and programs) and long-term individual and
   family outcomes following a diagnosis of FASD.},

Title = {Perceived need and barriers to adolescent mental health care: agreement
   between adolescents and their parents},
Journal = {EPIDEMIOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRIC SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {29},
Abstract = {Aims. Mental disorders cause high burden in adolescents, but adolescents
   often underutilise potentially beneficial treatments. Perceived need for
   and barriers to care may influence whether adolescents utilise services
   and which treatments they receive. Adolescents and parents are
   stakeholders in adolescent mental health care, but their perceptions
   regarding need for and barriers to care might differ. Understanding
   patterns of adolescent-parent agreement might help identify gaps in
   adolescent mental health care.
   Methods. A nationally representative sample of Australian adolescents
   aged 13-17 and their parents (N = 2310), recruited between 2013-2014,
   were asked about perceived need for four types of adolescent mental
   health care (counselling, medication, information and skill training)
   and barriers to care. Perceived need was categorised as fully met,
   partially met, unmet, or no need. Cohen's kappa was used to assess
   adolescent-parent agreement. Multinomial logistic regressions were used
   to model variables associated with patterns of agreement.
   Results. Almost half (46.5\% (S.E. = 1.21)) of either adolescents or
   parents reported a perceived need for any type of care. For both groups,
   perceived need was greatest for counselling and lowest for medication.
   Identified needs were fully met for a third of adolescents.
   Adolescent-parent agreement on perceived need was fair (kappa = 0.25
   (S.E. = 0.01)), but poor regarding the extent to which needs were met
   (kappa = -0.10 (S.E. = 0.02)). The lack of parental knowledge about
   adolescents' feelings was positively associated with adolescentparent
   agreement that needs were partially met or unmet and disagreement about
   perceived need, compared to agreement that needs were fully met
   (relative risk ratio (RRR) = 1.91 (95\% CI = 1.19-3.04) to RRR = 4.69
   (95\% CI = 2.38-9.28)). Having a probable disorder was positively
   associated with adolescent-parent agreement that needs were partially
   met or unmet (RRR = 2.86 (95\% CI = 1.46-5.61)), and negatively with
   adolescent-parent disagreement on perceived need (RRR = 0.50 (95\% CI =
   0.30-0.82)). Adolescents reported most frequently attitudinal barriers
   to care (e.g. self-reliance: 55.1\% (S.E. = 2.39)); parents most
   frequently reported that their child refused help (38.7\% (S.E. =
   2.69)). Adolescent-parent agreement was poor for attitudinal (kappa =
   -0.03 (S.E. = 0.06)) and slight for structural barriers (kappa = 0.02
   (S.E. = 0.09)).
   Conclusions. There are gaps in the extent to which adolescent mental
   health care is meeting the needs of adolescents and their parents. It
   seems important to align adolescents' and parents' needs at the
   beginning and throughout treatment and to improve communication between
   adolescents and their parents. Both might provide opportunities to
   increase the likelihood that needs will be fully met. Campaigns directed
   towards adolescents and parents need to address different barriers to
   care. For adolescents, attitudinal barriers such as stigma and mental
   health literacy require attention.},

Title = {An updated systematic review of interventions to increase awareness of
   mental health and well-being in athletes, coaches, officials and parents},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {Background: Interventions designed to increase mental health awareness
   in sport have grown substantially in the last 5 years, meaning that
   those involved in policy, research and intervention implementation are
   not fully informed by the latest systematic evaluation of research,
   risking a disservice to healthcare consumers. Hence, our aim was to
   update a 2017 systematic review that determined the effect of
   sport-specific mental health awareness programmes to improve mental
   health knowledge and help-seeking among sports coaches, athletes and
   officials. We extended the review to incorporate parents as a source of
   help-seeking and report the validity of outcome measures and quality of
   research design that occurred since the original review.
   Methods: Sport-specific mental health awareness programmes adopting an
   experimental or quasi-experimental design were included for synthesis.
   Five electronic databases were searched: Psychinfo, Medline (OVID
   interface), Scopus, Cochrane and Cinahl. Each database was searched from
   its year of inception to June 2020. As all of the outcomes measured were
   derived from psychometric scales, we observed statistically significant
   quantitative effects on the basis of p < .05, and a small, medium or
   large effect size as d = .2, .5 or .8, respectively. Risk of bias was
   assessed using the Cochrane and QATSQ tools.
   Results: Twenty-eight articles were included from the 2048 retrieved,
   eighteen additional articles since the original review. Eighteen studies
   targeted athletes, five with coaches, one sport officials (i.e.
   referees), one `at-risk children' and three with parents. One of the
   studies was a combination of athletes, coaches and parents. In terms of
   study outcomes, health referral efficacy was improved in seven studies;
   twelve studies reported an increase in knowledge about mental health
   disorders. Proportionally, higher quality research designs were evident,
   as three of ten studies within the previous review did not demonstrate a
   high risk of bias, whereas thirteen of the eighteen additional studies
   did not display a high risk of bias. However, only one study included a
   behaviour change model in both the programme design and evaluation.
   Conclusions: Our updated systematic review provides evidence of the
   benefits of mental health awareness interventions in sport; these
   benefits are mainly for athletes and show improvements in the
   methodological design of recent studies compared to the first review.
   There was also evidence of the extension of programme delivery to
   parents. In conclusion, researchers, practitioners and policy makers
   should consider methodological guidance and the application of theory
   when developing and evaluating complex interventions.},

Title = {Mental health outcomes, literacy and service provision in low- and

   of the Congo},
Journal = {NPJ MENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH},

Abstract = {In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the prevalence of mental
   health issues could be greater than in other low-income and
   middle-income countries because of major risk factors related to armed
   conflicts and poverty. Given that mental health is an essential
   component of health, it is surprising that no systematic evaluation of
   mental health in the DRC has yet been undertaken. This study aims to
   undertake the first systematic review of mental health literacy and
   service provision in the DRC, to bridge this gap and inform those who
   need to develop an evidence base. This could support policymakers in
   tackling the issues related to limited mental health systems and service
   provision in DRC. Following Cochrane and PRISMA guidelines, a systematic
   (Web of Science, Medline, Public Health, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar)
   search was conducted (January 2000 and August 2023). Combinations of key
   blocks of terms were used in the search such as DRC, war zone, mental
   health, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression,
   sexual violence, war trauma, resilience, mental health systems and
   service provision. We followed additional sources from reference lists
   of included studies. Screening was completed in two stages: title and
   abstract search, and full-text screening for relevance and quality.
   Overall, 50 studies were included in the review; the majority of studies
   (n = 31) were conducted in the Eastern region of the DRC, a region
   devastated by war and sexual violence. Different instruments were used
   to measure participants' mental health such as the Hopkins Symptoms
   Checklist (HSCL-25), The Harvard Trauma Questionnaire, Patient Health
   Questionnaire (PHQ-9); General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), and Positive
   and Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS). Our study found that wartime sexual
   violence and extreme poverty are highly traumatic, and cause multiple,
   long-term mental health difficulties. We found that depression, anxiety,
   and PTSD were the most common problems in the DRC. Psychosocial
   interventions such as group therapy, family support, and socio-economic
   support were effective in reducing anxiety, depression, and PTSD
   symptoms. This systematic review calls attention to the need to support
   sexual violence survivors and many other Congolese people affected by
   traumatic events. This review also highlights the need for validating
   culturally appropriate measures, and the need for well-designed
   controlled intervention studies in low-income settings such as the DRC.
   Better public mental health systems and service provision could help to
   improve community cohesion, human resilience, and mental wellbeing.
   There is also an urgent need to address wider social issues such as
   poverty, stigma, and gender inequality in the DRC.},

Title = {Health Literacy in Web-Based Health Information Environments: Systematic
   Review of Concepts, Definitions, and Operationalization for Measurement},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {20},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC 19},
Abstract = {Background: Health literacy research seems to lack a consensus on what
   aspects to include into literacy in the context of health and on how to
   operationalize these concepts for measurement purposes. In addition to
   health literacy, several other concepts, such as electronic health
   (eHealth) literacy and mental health literacy, have been developed
   across disciplines. This study examines how these different concepts are
   used when studying health-related competencies in Web contexts.
   Objective: This study systematically reviews health literacy concepts
   and definitions and their operationalization in studies focused on
   Web-based health information environments.
   Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in April 2016 in 6
   electronic databases with a limitation to articles in English published
   between January 2011 and April 2016. Altogether, 1289 unique records
   were identified and screened according to the predefined inclusion
   criteria: (1) original, peer-reviewed research articles written in
   English; (2) the topic of the article concerned literacy in the context
   of health; (3) informants of the study were lay people, not health
   professionals or students of the field; and (4) the focus of the study
   was placed on an Web-based information environment. In total, 180 full
   texts were screened, of which 68 were included in the review. The
   studies were analyzed with an emphasis on the used health literacy
   concepts and measures.
   Results: On the basis of the included studies, several concepts are in
   use when studying health-related literacy in Web environments, eHealth
   literacy and health literacy being the most common ones. The reviewed
   studies represent a variety of disciplines, but mostly medical sciences.
   Typically, quantitative research methods are used. On the basis of the
   definitions for health literacy, 3 thematic categories were identified:
   general and skill-based, multidimensional, and domain-specific health
   literacy. Most studies adopted a domain-specific concept, followed by
   the ones that used a general and skill-based concept. Multidimensional
   concepts occurred least frequently. The general health literacy concepts
   were usually operationalized with reading comprehension measures, the
   domain-specific concepts with self-efficacy measures, and
   multidimensional concepts with several types of measures. However,
   inconsistencies in operationalization were identified.
   Conclusions: The results show that in studies conducted in Web-based
   information environments, several different health literacy concepts are
   in use, and there is no clear consensus on the definitions for these
   concepts. Future studies should place emphasis on the conceptual
   development of health literacy in Web contexts to gain better results on
   operationalization for measurement. Researchers are encouraged to
   provide clear operational definitions for the concepts they use to
   ensure transparency in reporting.},

Title = {Young people's help-seeking for mental health problems},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN MENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {4},
Number = {3},
Pages = {218-251},
Abstract = {This paper summarises an ambitious research agenda aiming to uncover the
   factors that affect help-seeking among young people for mental health
   problems. The research set out to consider why young people, and
   particularly young males, do not seek help when they are in
   psychological distress or suicidal; how professional services be made
   more accessible and attractive to young people; the factors that inhibit
   and facilitate help-seeking; and how community gatekeepers can support
   young people to access services to help with personal and emotional
   problems. A range of studies was undertaken in New South Wales,
   Queensland and the ACT, using both qualitative and quantitative
   approaches. Data from a total of 2721 young people aged 14-24 years were
   gathered, as well as information from some of the community gatekeepers
   to young people's mental health care.
   Help-seeking was measured in all the studies using the General Help
   Seeking Questionnaire (Wilson, Deane, Ciarrochi \& Rickwood, 2005),
   which measures future help-seeking intentions and, through supplementary
   questions, can also assess prior help-seeking experience. Many of the
   studies also measured recent help-seeking behaviour using the Actual
   Help Seeking Questionnaire. The types of mental health problems examined
   varied across the studies and included depressive symptoms,
   personal-emotional problems, and suicidal thoughts.
   The help-seeking process was conceptualised using a framework developed
   during the research program. This framework maintains that help-seeking
   is a process of translating the very personal domain of psychological
   distress to the interpersonal domain of seeking help. Factors that were
   expected to facilitate or inhibit this translation process were
   investigated. These included factors that determine awareness of the
   personal domain of psychological distress and that affect the ability to
   articulate or express this personal domain to others, as well as
   willingness to disclose mental health issues to other people.
   The results are reported in terms of: patterns of help-seeking across
   adolescence and young adulthood; the relationship of help-seeking
   intentions to behaviour; barriers to seeking help-lack of emotional
   competence, the help-negation effect related to suicidal thoughts,
   negative attitudes and beliefs about help-seeking and fear of stigma;
   and facilitators of seeking help-emotional competence, positive past
   experience, mental health literacy, and supportive social influences.
   The paper considers the implications of the findings for the development
   of interventions to encourage young people to seek help for their mental
   health problems, and concludes by identifying gaps in the help-seeking
   research and literature and suggesting future directions.},

Title = {Improving Identification and Child-Focused Collaborative Care for
   Children of Parents With a Mental Illness in Tyrol, Austria},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Month = {APR 17},
Abstract = {Background: Children of parents with a mental illness (COPMI) are more
   likely to experience negative long-term adversities. However,
   interventions to support their needs early can significantly enhance
   adjustment and reduce negative outcomes. Approximately one in four
   children currently lives with a parent with mental illness worldwide.
   The lifelong impact for individuals, governments, and broader society is
   likely to be substantial. There are significant workforce barriers to
   the early identification of COPMI and addressing their needs,
   particularly within the adult mental health care system. The current
   study aims to reduce such barriers and to improve identification of
   COPMI in the current health care systems.
   Objectives: The project ``The Village{''} is a multidisciplinary health
   and social care policy intervention and seeks to improve child
   development and well-being outcomes for children of parents with a
   diagnosed mental illness. This will be achieved through the
   co-development, implementation, and evaluation of a practice approach to
   the early identification and collaborative care for COPMI, through
   establishing child-focused support networks. This will be done with open
   innovation science (OIS) approaches engaging the public in Tyrol, a
   geographical region of Austria, throughout 4 years. As part of the
   co-development process, we will work with stakeholders to co-develop the
   practice approaches based on evidence-based approaches and determine the
   most appropriate study design to evaluate those, as well as the
   implementation processes we will undertake.
   Methods: The project is underpinned by theories from different
   disciplines (i.e., public health, psychology, sociology, linguistics,
   economic sciences) as well as drawing on different approaches (i.e.,
   co-development, implementation science, symbolic interactionism, and
   realist evaluation). It is based on the seven content work packages
   (WPs): 1) management, 2) focusing on children and methods to understand
   their ``voice,{''} 3) scoping, 4) co-development, 5) implementation, 6)
   evaluating the practice approaches, and 7) knowledge dissemination.
   ``Scoping{''} will involve exploring the existing evidence, practice,
   and current state of identification and collaborative care in Tyrol,
   Austria. ``Co-development{''} involves the co-design of practice
   approaches to identify and support children in partnership with key
   stakeholders and service providers working in Tyrol. The
   ``implementation{''} of practice approaches will be based on the results
   of the co-development phase and will involve working with organizations
   to develop support strategies that draw on known organizational drivers
   from the field of implementation science to support the rollout of the
   practice approaches. In ``Evaluation{''} we will follow principles of a
   realist approach; this includes developing program theories and logic
   models for the practice approaches. Those will set out the outcomes
   hypothesized to achieve and the processes that are expected to lead to
   those changes. This will refer to changes in children, parents, and
   practitioners. We expect that the main focus will be on measuring child
   quality of life and mental health outcomes, and outcomes that are on the
   path to those (such as social support needs, resilience, mental health
   literacy, stigma, and help-seeking behavior) as well as costs. The
   ``child voice{''} WP focuses on children's perceptions and needs as the
   importance of ``assent{''} and support of children to develop their own
   ``voice{''} in health care is increasingly recognized within child
   health research. The ``dissemination{''} step focuses on reaching a
   broad public audience of different stakeholders, researchers, and
   families involved.
   Discussion: The research project aims to directly improve identification
   and support of vulnerable children across selected regions in Tyrol,
   Austria, and by doing so, improve the health and well-being of future
   generations, through breaking the cycle of intergenerational transfer of
   adverse childhood experiences.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {BackgroundMedical students suffer more pressure due to various reasons
   and their mental health problems get more attention. Resilience is a
   positive psychological perspective to explore the medical students'
   mental health and coping style problems. This study focuses on the
   medical students in school and uses the method of latent category
   analysis (LCA) to analyze the classification characteristics of their
   resilience. Therefore, the study aims to help psychological educators in
   medical colleges to develop positive mental health education strategies
   for medical students. ObjectiveTo explore the potential categories of
   resilience of medical students and the relationship between these
   categories and mental health and coping style. MethodsA total of 1,457
   medical students from four medical colleges in Anhui Province were
   selected as the research subjects by a convenience sampling method. A
   general information questionnaire, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale
   (CD-RISC), Kessler 10 and the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire
   (SCSQ) were used to investigate; SPSS 25.0 and Mplus 7 software were
   used for basic analysis and latent category exploration. Expected
   resultsThe medical students were divided into three potential categories
   of mental resilience: the low resilience group, moderate resilience
   self-improvement group and high resilience tough group. The optimism
   dimension level of the three categories was low. There were
   statistically significant differences in the distribution of resilience
   among medical students, such as gender, source of students, and paternal
   and maternal education level. There were significant differences in the
   mental health, positive coping style and negative coping style scores
   among the three categories. Female medical students with low parental
   education levels have a lower level of resilience. Logistic regression
   analysis showed that a lower maternal education level was a risk factor
   for resilience level, and a high positive coping style score and gender
   were protective factors for resilience level. DiscussionThere are group
   differences in the resilience of medical students, which suggests that
   school health workers should formulate targeted intervention programs
   for different types of students to improve their resilience and mental
   health, and further more, this study reminds mental health workers in
   colleges and universities to pay more attention to the mental health
   status of female medical students whose parents are less educated.},

Title = {Mobilizing Health Promotion Through Canada's Student Mental Health
   Network: Concurrent, Mixed Methods Process Evaluation},
Journal = {JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {9},
Abstract = {Background: Mental health issues among Canadian postsecondary students
   are prevalent. In tandem, an increased acknowledgment of the need for
   upstream mental health support has been highlighted. While the majority
   of institutions offer some form of mental health promotion, research
   suggests students are failing to access support due to barriers
   including lack awareness, geographical and financial barriers, and lack
   of relevance in offerings. Canada's Student Mental Health Network is a
   web-based knowledge mobilization initiative designed to fill these gaps.
   With content created and curated ``for-students, by-students{''} and
   reviewed by subject matter experts, the Network serves as a one-stop
   shop for evidence-based, mental health support for postsecondary
   students. Objective: The goal of this research was to conduct the first
   component of a comprehensive program evaluation of the Network. This
   paper details a formative, process evaluation after approximately 1 year
   of operations, with the goal of assessing acceptability and feasibility.
   Methods: Using a concurrent mixed methods study design, quantitative and
   qualitative data were simultaneously collected from students in order to
   evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of the Network as a mental
   health promotion resource. Quantitative data were automatically
   collected through Google Analytics via the website over the course of
   the first year of operations. Data collected included the number of
   users accessing the website, user engagement, and user ``stickiness.{''}
   Quantitative data were used to evaluate both accessibility and
   feasibility. Qualitative data were collected via individual, digital
   interviews conducted with a modest sample of students (n=8) across areas
   and levels of study. Qualitative data derived more detailed insights
   into user experience and website attributes, as well as feedback on
   content delivery, providing evidence used to evaluate feasibility.
   Results: A total of 1200 users globally accessed the Network within the
   first year of operations, with Canadian users accounting for nearly 90\%
   of total website traffic. An overall 66\% engagement rate was observed,
   with the average user visiting 7 pages per session. Further support for
   the acceptability of the Network is demonstrated in the Canada-wide
   reach of the content development and review team. Evidence for the
   feasibility of the Network was observed through website use statistics
   indicating the most frequently viewed pages aligned with our goals:
   providing mental health education and increasing awareness of available
   resources. Qualitative feedback provided additional context surrounding
   the feasibility of the space, including positive feedback on the
   esthetics, relevance, usability, inclusion, and accessibility. Areas for
   content expansion and improvements to accessibility were also
   identified. Conclusions: The results of this study provide evidence in
   support of the feasibility and acceptability of the Network a web-based
   knowledge mobilization initiative in support of postsecondary students'
   mental health and well-being. Future research will pursue a summative,
   impact assessment to evaluate utility.},

Title = {The trajectory of caregiver burden and the predictive role of sense of
   coherence among primary caregivers of colorectal cancer patients: a
   longitudinal study},
Journal = {BMC NURSING},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 26},
Abstract = {BackgroundPatients undergoing postoperative chemotherapy for colorectal
   cancer often have long-term and complex care needs, which places a
   significant physical and psychological burden on their primary
   caregivers. Sense of coherence (SOC) may help alleviate this burden by
   fostering correct perceptions and a positive mindset. This study aimed
   to analyze the trajectory of caregiver burden and the predictive role of
   SOC among primary caregivers of CRC patients. MethodsA longitudinal
   survey was conducted from November 2021 to November 2022 in the oncology
   departments of three Class A tertiary hospitals in Suzhou. The survey
   was collected at four time points: before the first chemotherapy, after
   the first chemotherapy, in the middle of the chemotherapy, and after the
   last chemotherapy. The Sense of Coherence scale and the Zarit Caregiver
   Burden Interview were used. Growth Mixture Modeling classified potential
   trajectories of caregiver burden, and logistic regression assessed the
   influence of SOC on these. Results204 primary caregivers of CRC patients
   completed the survey. The overall caregiver burden showed an initial
   increase and subsequent decrease, being most severe at T2 and least
   severe at T4. Caregiver burden trajectories were categorized into low
   and high caregiving burden groups (P < 0.01). SOC was moderate (65.52
   +/- 14.75) and was negatively associated with the trajectory of
   caregiver burden (OR = 0.955, 95\% CI: 0.927-0.985). Factors
   significantly linked to the high-burden group included having one child,
   low education, being the patient's child, having other family members to
   care for, lacking alternative caregivers, and caregiving >= 12 h daily
   (all P < 0.01). ConclusionA lower SOC can exacerbate the primary
   caregiver burden. Healthcare professionals should pay special attention
   to primary caregivers who have low education, have one child, are the
   children of patients, are responsible for caring for other family
   members, and lack alternative caregivers. Timely interventions should be
   initiated to provide appropriate support, such as mental health
   education, SOC training, cognitive therapy, and other interventions.
   These efforts aim to enhance SOC levels and reduce the caregiver burden,
   thereby promoting the overall well-being of primary caregivers. Clinical

Title = {Development and Pilot-Testing of an Optimized Conversational Agent or
   ``Chatbot{''} for Peruvian Adolescents Living With HIV to Facilitate
   Mental Health Screening, Education, Self-Help, and Linkage to Care:
   Protocol for a Mixed Methods, Community-Engaged Study},
Journal = {JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {13},
Abstract = {Background: Adolescents living with HIV are disproportionally affected
   by depression, which worsens antiretroviral therapy adherence, increases
   viral load, and doubles the risk of mortality. Because most adolescents
   living with HIV live in low- and middle -income countries, few receive
   depression treatment due to a lack of mental health services and
   specialists in low -resource settings. Chatbot technology, used
   increasingly in health service delivery, is a promising approach for
   delivering low -intensity depression care to adolescents living with HIV
   in resource -constrained settings. Objective: The goal of this study is
   to develop and pilot -test for the feasibility and acceptability of a
   prototype, optimized conversational agent (chatbot) to provide mental
   health education, self-help skills, and care linkage for adolescents
   living with HIV. Methods: Chatbot development comprises 3 phases
   conducted over 2 years. In the first phase (year 1), formative research
   will be conducted to understand the views, opinions, and preferences of
   up to 48 youths aged 10-19 years (6 focus groups of up to 8 adolescents
   living with HIV per group), their caregivers (5 in-depth interviews),
   and HIV program personnel (5 in-depth interviews) regarding depression
   among adolescents living with HIV. We will also investigate the
   perceived acceptability of a mental health chatbot, including barriers
   and facilitators to accessing and using a chatbot for depression care by
   adolescents living with HIV. In the second phase (year 1), we will
   iteratively program a chatbot using the SmartBot360 software with
   successive versions (0.1, 0.2, and 0.3), meeting regularly with a Youth
   Advisory Board comprised of adolescents living with HIV who will guide
   and inform the chatbot development and content to arrive at a prototype
   version (version 1.0) for pilot -testing. In the third phase (year 2),
   we will pilot -test the prototype chatbot among 50 adolescents living
   with HIV na \& iuml;ve to its development. Participants will interact
   with the chatbot for up to 2 weeks, and data will be collected on the
   acceptability of the chatbot-delivered depression education and
   self-help strategies, depression knowledge changes, and intention to
   seek care linkage. Results: The study was awarded in April 2022,
   received institutional review board approval in November 2022, received
   funding in December 2022, and commenced recruitment in March 2023. By
   the completion of study phases 1 and 2, we expect our chatbot to
   incorporate key needs and preferences gathered from focus groups and
   interviews to develop the chatbot. By the completion of study phase 3,
   we will have assessed the feasibility and acceptability of the prototype
   chatbot. Study phase 3 began in April 2024. Final results are expected
   by January 2025 and published thereafter. Conclusions: The study will
   produce a prototype mental health chatbot developed with and for
   adolescents living with HIV that will be ready for efficacy testing in a
   subsequent, larger study. International Registered Report Identifier

   Previous studies have shown that social support may be a factor in
   alleviating smartphone addiction. However, its specific mechanism needs
   further exploration. The purpose of this study is to examine the chain
   mediating effects of negative emotions and self-control on the
   relationship between social support and smartphone addiction. MethodsA
   cross-sectional survey was conducted from January 2022 to April 2023 in
   Sichuan Province, China, with 5,188 respondents aged 15 years or older.
   Spearman's correlation analysis was used to determine correlations
   between social support, negative emotions, self-control, and smartphone
   addiction. We construct a Structural Equation Model (SEM) to explore the
   pathways of smartphone addiction across different age groups.
   ResultsSocial support, negative emotions, self-control, and smartphone
   addiction were found to be significantly related (p < 0.01).In the
   population aged 15-44, a complete SEM pathway analysis was achieved,
   while for the population aged 45-64, a simplified version of the pathway
   analysis was obtained. Among the population aged 65 and above, multiple
   pathways were found to be nonsignificant. For the full sample, social
   support not only exhibited a negative correlation with smartphone
   addiction (beta = -0.410; 95\% CI: -0.534 to -0.320) but also influenced
   smartphone addiction through three specific pathways: via negative
   emotions (beta = -0.041; 95\% CI: -0.066 to -0.021), via self-control
   (beta = -0.087; 95\% CI: -0.119 to -0.063), and via a sequential effect
   of negative emotions and self-control (beta = -0.047; 95\% CI: -0.062 to
   -0.036). The 15-44 age group demonstrated similar pathways to the full
   sample, whereas the 45-64 age group lost the pathway mediated solely by
   negative emotions. ConclusionsOur study shows that high social support
   reduces smartphone addiction by diminishing negative emotions and
   improving self-control.The effect is more pronounced in the 15-44 age
   group.We suggest strengthening the social support system through more
   activities and urge relevant departments to improve the mental health
   education, enhance self-control training, and promote mental well-being
   to help avoid smartphone addiction. Trial registrationClinical trial

Title = {Meet Mohammed: using simulation and technology to support learning},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH TRAINING EDUCATION AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Pages = {66-75},
Abstract = {Purpose - Clinical placements within healthcare are fundamental to
   student development and higher education institutions need to ensure
   that students' learning within practice is supported. There is an
   increasing evidence base to suggest that simulation may help to bridge
   this gap. The purpose of this paper is to describe how a cohort of 85
   first-year mental health students undertook a simulation project, in
   which they followed the admission of a virtual patient (in the form of
   an avatar) called Mohammed, to an acute inpatient ward. This simulation
   project was a two-week experience for student nurses, whereby they
   engaged with a virtual service user and worked in teams and as
   individuals to support his recovery. This project allowed students to
   practice their clinical skills and communication skills within a safe
   and supportive environment.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper is an evaluation of a two-week
   experience for student nurses where they were supported to engage with a
   virtual service user. It was designed to provide students with exposure
   to decision making, critical thinking and the application of clinical
   reasoning in a simulated working environment. Students were able to
   practice their clinical and communication skills within a safe and
   supportive environment. Student understanding was measured before the
   project began, on completion to measure any changes and again when the
   student had had returned to practice to see if they had maintained their
   skills.
   Findings - Several emergent themes were identified: first, students
   acknowledged a greater level of learning during activities which they
   considered most challenging and in some cases the least enjoyable. This
   raises questions about the management of emotions in unfamiliar learning
   situations and of student expectations around the ``Gamification{''} of
   learning. Students wanted increased interaction with the avatar and
   there is potential to continue to develop this project in terms of
   measuring application of knowledge and student performance by using
   innovative assessment and engagement strategies.
   Practical implications - This project provides a platform for the active
   contribution of service users, carers and specialist teams. It allows
   educational input to closely align to practice needs, for lecturers to
   support and feedback on practice experiences and it opens up flexible
   and remote working for students. With an understanding of the principles
   and practice behind it, this project could be adapted for other practice
   and managerial learning events. Some examples include:
   multi-disciplinary team-building activities, to form part of an
   assessment or interview process, or integrated within a provider's own
   polices and opportunities for practice learning, such as preceptorship.
   Originality/value - This paper explores opportunities for creative
   engagement in learning with service users, practice teams and students
   and it highlights the need for an evidence base around simulation for
   mental health nurse education.},

Title = {Asset-based community development approaches to resilience among
   refugees and recent migrant communities in Australia: a scoping review},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MIGRATION HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Pages = {77-96},
Month = {AUG 4},
Abstract = {Purpose - Resilience is an increasingly important concept that
   contributes to sustainability and wellbeing of a community. Asset-based
   community development (ABCD) may offer promising approaches to boosting
   community resilience in Australia, especially within marginalised
   groups.
   Design/methodology/approach - A scoping review was conducted to
   conceptualise existing literature on ABCD approaches to building
   resilience. Research databases were searched with relevant details.
   Findings - Thirty-three sources were identified as meeting the inclusion
   criteria and were reviewed in terms of six themes: integration and
   identity, health, mental health, education, employment and community
   planning. Issues identified by the literature within these themes can be
   alleviated through asset-based approaches. Implications for planning of
   asset-based programs and policy change are discussed in light of the
   findings.
   Practical implications - The results of this study provide several
   implications for practise, policy recommendations and future research
   into this area. Results suggest that increasing capacity around
   asset-based coping mechanisms, such as support networks through
   religious and cultural groups, would promote community development and
   foster resilience. Furthermore, policy on refugees in multiple areas,
   such as psychological service provision and employment, should be
   redesigned in a way that acknowledges their complex and diverse needs
   and facilitates their integration into the community. Though multiple
   ways to achieve this goal have been explored in literature, a sustained
   and broader approach is necessary to see widespread change. Further
   research and funding are required to explore and implement appropriate
   responses. Based on the findings and discussion above, the authors make
   the following policy recommendations. Service providers need to be aware
   of and incorporate culturally appropriate programs in the areas of
   mental health assessment and intervention, education and employment. The
   trauma-informed approach should be used when dealing with refugee groups
   and other groups who have faced hardships. Government policy should
   focus on improving community engagement to create and strengthen social
   networks, which are vital in boosting integration into the community and
   increasing health education and access to services. Government should
   focus on asset-based approaches in designing education and employment
   integration programs to promote social belonging and community
   engagement, and thus, community resilience, which will consequently have
   beneficial individual and group outcomes. The current governmental
   policy surrounding refugees should be overhauled with the goal of
   successful refugee integration in mind, such as incorporating the
   ability for refugees to access vital services such as employment and
   skills transferability programs. Due to current policy, these services
   are inaccessible to a large portion of refugees, hindering their
   integration. Government needs to create specific guidelines for the
   provision of psychological services to refugees to improve the quality
   of mental health services available to this group.

   the relevant existing literature by the project team. The process was
   rigorous, and no content of the analysis has been published previously
