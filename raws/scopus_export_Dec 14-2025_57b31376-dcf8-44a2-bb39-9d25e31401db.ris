AB  - Agitation in healthcare, particularly in psychiatric settings, is a prevalent and escalating global concern. Despite its significance, healthcare students often feel underprepared to manage agitation, citing fear, stigma, and limited clinical exposure. Traditional teaching methods, such as lectures or simulations, are resource-intensive and offer limited opportunities for repeated practice in low-risk environments. Virtual reality (VR) offers a promising alternative, providing immersive, standardised, and repeatable training for high-stress clinical scenarios. In response, the education team at [redacted for peer review], developed the Managing AGgression using Immersive Content (MAGIC) programme. This three-hour blended learning workshop, a mandatory component of the psychiatry curriculum for medical and nursing students, integrates didactic teaching, role-play, and the Virtual Reality in Agitation Management (VRAM) activity. Through experiential learning, MAGIC aims to enhance healthcare students’ confidence, empathy, mental health literacy, and competence in managing agitation in psychiatric healthcare settings. Using a pre- and post-test quasi-experimental design, we evaluated the programme’s effectiveness among 152 medical and nursing students. Results demonstrated significant improvements in mental health literacy, self-perceived proficiency, and confidence in managing agitated patients; there was also a marked reduction in stigma towards individuals with mental health conditions. In addition, participants responded positively to all aspects of the VRAM software, underscoring its usability and educational value. These findings highlight the potential of integrating immersive VR technology with traditional pedagogical methods to transform healthcare education by fostering deeper engagement, enhancing clinical competence, and ultimately improving patient outcomes. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Art-based practices have been expected and incorporated into adolescent mental health education, enhanced by their potential to promote positive psychosocial development and foster resilience. Elite athletes, while encountering similar challenges as adolescents—such as reluctance to seek psychological support—occupy a distinctive position due to their capacity to exert substantial influence on youth. This paper presents the development and conceptualization of a novel, elite athlete-led mental health education framework that employs artistic expression as a core modality. We showed and explained the 'Yowai-wa-Tsuyoi Project' ('Weakness is Strength'), an initiative undertaken in Japan that seeks to harness the personal narratives of elite athletes to effect positive change in adolescents' mental health literacy. By collaborating with the Japan Rugby Players Association and mental health experts, the project integrates art-based interventions to stimulate dialogue on mental health, stress, and overall well-being. By sharing their lived experiences, athletes facilitate art-driven activities wherein students are encouraged to express and reflect upon their mental health experiences. This interdisciplinary initiative aspires to enhance adolescents’ understanding of mental health through relatable athlete role models, foster emotional articulation via artistic media, and nurture empathy and collective support for mental well-being. The integration of sports, education, and art in this approach illustrates a potentially transformative model for engaging adolescents in critical discourse surrounding mental health and well-being. Furthermore, it underscores the importance of creating educational environments that embrace vulnerability, expression, and dialogue, thus providing students with the tools and space to address their mental health in a supportive context. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Purpose: To summarize the effect of mental health first aid (MHFA) on paramedics and medical nursing students and provide direction to future training and research. Methods: Seven databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, China Knowledge, Wanfang, and China Biomedical Literature Database, were searched for relevant studies from database establishment up to January 31, 2023. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the quality of randomized controlled trials, qualitative studies, and single-armed trials on the basis of the literature evaluation criteria developed by the JBI Center for Evidence-Based Healthcare in Australia. Mixed-sex studies were assessed by using the mixed-methods assessment tool (MMAT 2018). Results: The review identified 11 studies that met the criteria, most of which reported on the effects of MHFA training in terms of mental health literacy (referred to as MHL), MHFA intentions and confidence, stigma, and changes in social distance. A few studies analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of MHFA training courses, motivation to complete MHFA, barriers and facilitators to MHFA training, and participants' perceptions of implementing MHFA training. Conclusions: The MHFA curriculum is practical for healthcare workers and medical nursing students. In the future, a standardized training program based on the population characteristics of healthcare workers and medical nursing students must be developed to standardize the measurement of outcome indicators to reflect the effectiveness of implementing the MHFA training curriculum.

AB  - Background: Effective parenting can mediate the negative impact of complex humanitarian emergencies (CHEs) on child mental health, however many caregivers struggle to parent effectively in these settings. Parenting interventions have robust evidence in many settings, however research supporting their use in CHEs is limited. We describe the development of a caregiver group intervention delivered by non-specialist staff to support child mental health in CHEs. Methods: A multi-phase, multi-method approach was employed: Phase 1: semi-structured interviews, analysed inductively, with specialist mental health staff in CHEs on needs and challenges in providing mental healthcare to children and caregivers. Phase 2: initial intervention development informed by Phase 1 and evidence-based theoretical approaches and psychological therapies. Phase 3: expert review of draft intervention. Phase 4: semi-structured interviews, analysed inductively, with non-specialist staff in Papua New Guinea (PNG) to evaluate relevance, comprehensibility, and applicability of the intervention. Phase 5: cultural adaptation of the intervention prior to implementation in Northern Iraq. Different operational partners and research sites were employed at different phases of development to increase diversity of inputs and support the overall vision of an intervention that addressed common mental health difficulties and underlying factors to support children and caregivers across CHEs. Results: Mental health staff in CHEs identified a significant need for interventions to support parenting and address child mental health needs. A caregiver group intervention was developed consisting of six two-hour sessions, delivered weekly by non-specialist staff, and targeting parent knowledge and skills and parent stress. Expert consultation identified aspects of the intervention to emphasise or simplify, resulting in a refined intervention with ensured clinical quality. Non-specialist staff in PNG confirmed the intervention relevance to a vulnerable population in a humanitarian setting, and the manual was determined suitable for non-specialist facilitators. Mental health literacy, stigma and cultural views (masculinity, family privacy) were identified as challenges to address. A multi-stage method of cultural adaptation in Iraq ensured the clinical and cultural accuracy, relevance, and acceptability of the intervention. Initial adaptations to the language and metaphors used in the intervention resulted in high cultural appropriateness during pilot testing. Prioritising the recruitment and engagement of male caregivers is critical. Conclusions: A caregiver intervention to support child mental health in CHEs is available. It’s development using multi-method, co-design processes will ensure its relevance and acceptability to target populations. Further research to evaluate the effectiveness and long-term effectiveness of the intervention is warranted. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Background: With the rapid development of the internet, smartphones have become an indispensable part of our lives. However, prolonged, excessive and uncontrolled use may lead to the hidden danger of smartphone addiction, posing a threat to users’ physical and mental health. Previous studies have shown that social support may be a factor in alleviating smartphone addiction. However, its specific mechanism needs further exploration. The purpose of this study is to examine the chain mediating effects of negative emotions and self-control on the relationship between social support and smartphone addiction. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from January 2022 to April 2023 in Sichuan Province, China, with 5,188 respondents aged 15 years or older. Spearman’s correlation analysis was used to determine correlations between social support, negative emotions, self-control, and smartphone addiction. We construct a Structural Equation Model (SEM) to explore the pathways of smartphone addiction across different age groups. Results: Social support, negative emotions, self-control, and smartphone addiction were found to be significantly related (p < 0.01).In the population aged 15–44, a complete SEM pathway analysis was achieved, while for the population aged 45–64, a simplified version of the pathway analysis was obtained. Among the population aged 65 and above, multiple pathways were found to be nonsignificant. For the full sample, social support not only exhibited a negative correlation with smartphone addiction (β = -0.410; 95% CI: -0.534 to -0.320) but also influenced smartphone addiction through three specific pathways: via negative emotions (β = -0.041; 95% CI: -0.066 to -0.021), via self-control (β = -0.087; 95% CI: -0.119 to -0.063), and via a sequential effect of negative emotions and self-control (β = -0.047; 95% CI: -0.062 to -0.036). The 15–44 age group demonstrated similar pathways to the full sample, whereas the 45–64 age group lost the pathway mediated solely by negative emotions. Conclusions: Our study shows that high social support reduces smartphone addiction by diminishing negative emotions and improving self-control.The effect is more pronounced in the 15–44 age group.We suggest strengthening the social support system through more activities and urge relevant departments to improve the mental health education, enhance self-control training, and promote mental well-being to help avoid smartphone addiction.

AB  - Background: In Burkina Faso, nearly half of the population is under 15 years old, and one in four adolescents experience depression. This underscores the critical need to enhance mental health literacy among adolescents and youth, empowering them to manage their mental well-being effectively. Comic books offer an engaging approach to health education, yet their effectiveness in addressing mental health remains largely untested. Our study aims to fill this gap by evaluating the effectiveness of comic books in enhancing mental health literacy among adolescents and young adults aged 10–24 years. Methods: We will recruit 2,007 participants aged 10–24, stratify them by age, and randomly assign them to three groups (1:1:1): a comic book intervention group (Intervention 1), a text-only flyer group (Intervention 2), and a control group with no intervention. The primary outcome will be mental health literacy and secondary outcomes will include anxiety, depression, and intentions to cope. Discussion: We hypothesize that the comic book intervention and flyer intervention will prove more effective in improving mental health literacy than the control group. We further hypothesize that for younger adolescents (10–14), the comic book will be more effective at increasing mental health literacy than the flyer. Conversely, we hypothesize that the flyer will be more effective in increasing mental health literacy for older adolescents (15–24). Our study will provide evidence on novel interventions designed to enhance mental health literacy among adolescents and young adults in low-resource settings.

AB  - Background: In a world confronted with new and connected challenges, novel strategies are needed to help children and adults achieve their full potential, to predict, prevent and treat disease, and to achieve equity in services and outcomes. Australia’s Generation Victoria (GenV) cohorts are designed for multi-pronged discovery (what could improve outcomes?) and intervention research (what actually works, how much and for whom?). Here, we describe the key features of its protocol. Methods: GenV is a whole-population longitudinal platform open to all ≈150,000 children born within a two-year window and residing in the state of Victoria and their parents. GenV is guided by its 6 principles of Inclusivity, Collaboration, Sustainability, Enhancement, Systematised Processes and Value and enabled by large-scale biobanking, IT and novel high-throughput technology infrastructure. Successive recruitment phases were designed to maximise GenV’s inclusivity: (1) a smaller Advance Cohort from December 2020; (2) Newborn recruitment, with presence in 58 Victorian maternity services supporting face-to-face approach to parents of babies born 4 October 2021–3 October 2023; (3) Intensive remote recruitment to mid-2024 targeting those missed around birth; and (4) Ongoing indefinite enrolment of in-age children and their parents. Participants consent to universal (1) data linkage (e.g., state and federal physical and mental health, education, social, geospatial, ecological); (2) biosamples storage and use (e.g., residual clinical pregnancy and newborn screening, GenV-collected perinatal parent/infant saliva); (3) phenotypic and biosamples collection waves at child ages 6, 11 and 16 years, likely in schools and remotely for parents; and (4) opportunities for collaborative research integrated into GenV as a population registry (e.g., trials, natural experiments, depth subcohorts). Many participants supplement universal data with additional biosamples (e.g., infant stool, breast milk) and brief digital remote ‘GenV and Me’ assessments over the first 5 years. GenV will make all research data available, adhering to the principles of Open Science. Discussion: Launched in the COVID-19 pandemic and committed to diversity and inclusivity, GenV’s parallel consented child and pre-midlife cohorts will be positioned to help address today’s pressing issues such as chronic mental and physical health conditions, inequity, public health crises such as pandemics, and climate harm.

AB  - Background: Stigma is recognised as one of the most significant barriers to treatment for people with mental health conditions. However, limited studies are available in low-resource settings. Objectives: To assess the magnitude of internalised stigma and associated factors among people with mental health conditions attending tertiary outpatient psychiatric services in Ethiopia. Methods: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 306 consecutively selected outpatient attendees of mental health services. Stigma was assessed using an interviewer administered instrument, the Internalised Stigma of Mental Illness Scale (ISMI) previously adapted for use in the Ethiopian setting. Data were collected using standard tools for medication adherence, social support, quality of life and self-esteem. Clinical information was extracted from medical record. Binary logistic regression analysis was carried out to assess factors associated with internalised stigma. Odds ratios along with 95% confidence intervals were estimated to measure the strength of the association. Results: The magnitude of internalised stigma among participants was 36.6% [95% CI: (31.2%,42.3%)]. Having anxiety disorder [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.22; 95% confidence interval (CI): (0.07,0.66)], having other milder forms of psychiatric disorders [AOR = 0.19; 95% CI: (0.05,0.78)], a history of suicide attempt [AOR = 1.99; 95% CI: (1.02,3.87)], low self-esteem [AOR = 7.52; 95% CI: (3.58,15.78)] and poor quality of life [AOR = 2.06; 95% CI: (1.06,4.02)] were associated with internalised stigma among participants. Conclusion: Internalised stigma remains a significant challenge among mental health service users in Ethiopia. Interventions that target individuals with psychotic, bipolar and depressive disorders with a history of suicide, low self-esteem and poor quality of life should be implemented to reduce internalised stigma among people with mental health conditions. Efforts should also target external factors, such as improving mental health literacy and challenging negative stereotypes. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Methamphetamine (MA) use is on the rise in Nigeria with the dire consequences to the adolescent's mental health, education, and society. Despite the pervasiveness and accessibility of the drug, relatively little research has examined in-school adolescents. Our study explored in-school adolescents MA use awareness, sources of information, prevalence and socio-demographic risk factors. A cross-sectional analytical design was applied, drawing on data from in-school adolescents between the ages of 10 and 19 in Ebonyi state. The participants were recruited using a multistage sampling procedure, while a semi-structured questionnaire was used for data collection. Percentages were used to analyze data on MA use awareness, sources of information, and prevalence, while multivariable logistic regression adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were used to analyze the association between socio-demographic risk factors and MA use. The level of significance was set at P < 0.05. The results reveal that the majority of in-school adolescents have MA use awareness (95.1 %). Social media, [Facebook/WhatsApp] were the most prominent sources of information (93.2 %). The lifetime prevalence of MA use was 19.2 %, past year 19.9 %, past month 23.5 %, and past week 7.8 %. The adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for socio-factors show peer pressure/friends was 3.22 times (P≤0.05) more likely than others to predict MA use. Demographic factors show that on-campus adolescents were 3.7 times, off-campus 4.23 times (P≤0.05) more likely than family house to predict MA. Being polygamous was 2.28 times, single parent 2.92 times more likely than being monogamous to predict MA, (P≤0.05). Being a traditional worshiper was 9.52 times less likely than being Christian, (P≤0.05), while being Muslim had no association with MA use (P≤0.05).These findings highlight the potential of adopting a multi-sectorial approach to tackle MA use, including social media use intervention, parental monitoring/support, therapists for risk behaviour counseling, scale-up school-based intervention policy/laws for early use prevention. © 2025

AB  - International students face elevated risk for mental health problems and suicide, yet encounter multiple barriers to accessing timely and culturally responsive treatments. Key challenges include high rates of psychological distress, low mental health literacy, and reduced help-seeking, often compounded by perceived burdensomeness, a lack of belonging, and difficulties with emotion regulation. Bud is a self-guided, co-designed mobile app developed to address these challenges through an accessible digital intervention. This paper outlines a protocol for a randomized controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness, acceptability, engagement, and safety of Bud among international students enrolled at Australian tertiary institutions. The trial also includes an internal pilot phase to ensure the feasibility of the trial procedures, with benchmarks for recruitment, retention, and engagement. A community sample of 302 participants will be randomly assigned to either the intervention group (Bud app) or the active control group (online mental health fact sheets) for four weeks. Assessments will be completed online at baseline, two weeks, and four weeks post-baseline. The primary outcome is psychological distress, with secondary outcomes including help-seeking intentions, perceived burdensomeness and belonging, emotion regulation, mental health literacy, and suicidal ideation. Acceptability and engagement will be assessed using self-report and objective measures. Interviews will be conducted with a subset of 20 participants to explore their views on Bud further. This trial will provide the first evaluation of a suicide prevention tool specifically for international students. If effective, Bud could offer a scalable and culturally relevant solution to improve student mental health and reduce service access barriers. Trial registration ACTRN12625000584437. © 2025 .

AB  - This study addresses the mental health challenges faced by students majoring in sports education and explores more effective strategies for mental health education. Using Internet of Things (IoT) data mining, relevant datasets are collected and categorized. A Random Forest (RF) model is then trained and optimized through a genetic algorithm, resulting in the Genetic Algorithm–Random Forest (GA-RF) psychological state perception model. The model is evaluated against multiple classification approaches. In the depression dichotomy experiment, the GA-RF model achieves superior results, with an optimized accuracy and an F1 score of 0.81, outperforming other algorithms in psychological state perception. By applying this model, routine data from students’ daily activities can be analyzed to provide timely insights into their mental health. These insights support adjustments to teaching content and offer schools an evidence-based approach to improving instruction. Overall, the GA-RF model enhances data mining and prediction of students’ psychological states, making it a valuable tool for advancing mental health education in sports education programs. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Objective Mental health literacy (MHL) research in young people has expanded significantly, demonstrating its importance for prevention and early intervention. However, MHL research has primarily focused on school contexts, overlooking young people who may be disengaged from school, many of whom face heightened risk and structural disadvantage. This narrow focus creates a critical gap in understanding MHL across diverse cohorts of young people, some of whom may need MHL interventions but remain underrepresented in current research. Method This scoping review mapped the scope and characteristics of empirical research on MHL in young people beyond school-exclusive contexts to identify where, how, and with whom MHL has been studied outside school contexts. A comprehensive search of seven electronic databases and hand searching identified 31 empirical studies for inclusion. Results Several studies examined MHL among young people in non-school contexts and recruited young people from diverse settings. MHL levels and intervention outcomes varied across these contexts. Findings also highlighted a preference for informal support and the potential of digital tools to enhance MHL. While school-based research continues to dominate the field, these studies indicate progress toward broader inclusion of diverse cohorts of young people. Nevertheless, recruitment methods often relied heavily on gatekeepers, and several vulnerable cohorts remain underrepresented in existing research. Conclusion The review underscores the critical need for inclusive, context-sensitive, and equity-driven approaches to investigating MHL among young people. Future research should prioritise participatory methods and diverse settings beyond school context to ensure MHL initiatives effectively reach and support all young people. © © 2025.

AB  - Background: Adolescent mental health (MH) is increasingly recognized as a critical component of sustainable development (SD); however, awareness and utilization of MH services among adolescents remain limited in many communities. This study aims to examine adolescents’ awareness of mental health issues and their perceptions of its role in sustainable development. Methods: A cross-sectional survey design was employed to collect data from adolescents in six senior high schools located in the Eastern Region of Ghana. A total of 424 adolescents were sampled using both stratified and simple random sampling techniques. A self-developed questionnaire was utilized, and data were analyzed using IBM SPSS version 24. Results: Adolescents reported high recognition of common MH issues (≈ 90% for depression/anxiety/stress) but lower recognition of schizophrenia (74%) and bipolar disorder (78%). A majority were unaware of adolescent-specific MH services (69%). No significant gender difference was observed in MH–SD perceptions after accounting for unequal variances (p = 0.10). Conclusion: There is a need for targeted mental health education and policy interventions to enhance awareness, improve accessibility, and integrate mental health services within sustainable development frameworks and educational curricula. Addressing these gaps is essential for advancing adolescent well-being and promoting long-term social and economic progress. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Objective: Mental health challenges among adolescents have become a critical public health concern, particularly given the increasing prevalence of suicidal behaviours in this age group. While the relationships between mental health literacy, social support, and suicide risk have been studied globally, there is limited evidence from culturally specific contexts, particularly in less urbanized regions of Iran such as Khoy city. This study aimed to investigate mental health literacy) ability to understand and manage their own and others’ mental health (and its relationship with suicidal tendencies, mediated by social support, among students. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in 2024 in Khoy city, West-Azerbaijan, Iran. The study included 605 high-school students from six selected schools, who were selected through two-step random sampling.Mental Health Literacy, social support and suicide tendency questionnaires along with demographic information were used for data gathering. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS AMOS Statistics 24 software. A structural equation modeling was employed to evaluate the relationships between the study variables and to test the conceptual framework. Results: The structural model results revealed significant direct and indirect associations among the variables. Mental Health Literacy (MHL) positively influenced the social support (β = 0.135, P = 0.03), while socioeconomic status (SES) also had a positive effect (β = 0.203, P < 0.001). Social support was found to negatively affect suicide tendency (β = -0.823, P < 0.001). Although MHL did not directly impact suicide tendency, it had a significant negative indirect effect through social support (β = -0.112, P = 0.04). SES also indirectly reduced suicide tendency (β = -0.167, P < 0.001). Living with parents had a direct negative effect on suicide tendency (β = -0.081, P = 0.04). Conclusions: Based on the findings of this study, the importance of integrating mental health literacy into curricula, establishing peer support networks, and strengthening family-school collaboration within existing frameworks such as the WHO Action Plan is emphasized. Furthermore, these results may provide a foundation for developing localized guidelines aimed at enhancing mental health literacy and social support in schools; however, longitudinal and intervention studies are necessary to confirm the effectiveness of these recommendations. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Background: Autism and ADHD are heritable, co-occurrent, and associated with difficulties with executive functioning (cognitive and self-regulation skills which enable us to set and work toward goals). Executive function difficulties, and their negative impacts across cognitive, health and social domains, extend to individuals with first-degree relatives who are autistic or have ADHD, even if they do not meet thresholds for a clinical diagnosis themselves. Supporting executive function development in children with elevated autism traits, or a first-degree relative with autism or ADHD, addresses community priorities for early support to help achieve the best mental health, education and life outcomes. Methods: This study will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a parent-toddler programme entitled “Supporting Toddlers with a connection to autism or ADHD to develop strong Attention, Regulation and Thinking skills” (START). START is a neurodiversity-affirming programme, co-refined through extensive Patient and Public Involvement. Sixty parent-child dyads, in Oxford or Southampton (UK), will be randomized using Sealed Envelope by a researcher not involved in recruitment, delivery or outcome data collection to receive START or usual practice, on a 1:1 ratio. Children (20 months old) will be assessed using questionnaires completed by the parent (not blind to allocation) post-intervention (within 2 weeks of the end of the active intervention wave, when children are aged 27–31 months), and using parent questionnaires and a battery of executive function measures administered by researchers blind to allocation at baseline and follow-up (36 months old). START will be delivered in small groups to 30 parent-child dyads, in community settings. Discussion: We will assess the feasibility of recruiting eligible participants to the study, the reliability of measures of implementation fidelity and degree of implementation fidelity achieved, the appropriateness of proposed outcome and mechanism measures, the acceptability of an RCT of the programme, parental adherence to the programme, logistics of programme delivery, and the acceptability of START, using mixed-method measures of engagement and satisfaction. Results will inform the design and implementation of a definitive RCT of START, and yield broader insights into the delivery and evaluation of complex early-years interventions in community settings.

AB  - Objective: This study aims to assess and predict global and Chinese schizophrenia burden trends from 1990 to 2030. Methods: Retrieve data from the 2021 Global Burden of Disease Study to estimate the incidence, prevalence, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of schizophrenia from 1990 to 2021. Establish a joint point analysis and Bayesian age-period-cohort (BAPC) model to predict the burden of schizophrenia in 2030. Result: In 2021, the global prevalence of schizophrenia was approximately 13.60 million cases, with an age-standardized rate of 275.78 per 100,000 population. The global incidence was around 1.2 0million cases, with a rate of 15.43 per 100,000, and the global DALYs totaled 14.80 million, with a rate of 177.75 per 100,000. In China, the prevalence was about 5.30 million cases (300.81 per 100,000), the incidence was 236,175 cases (18.36 per 100,000), and DALYs were 3.40 million (203.88 per 100,000). From 1990 to 2021, China’s age-standardized prevalence and DALY rates increased, with estimated annual percentage change (EAPCs) of 0.12 and 0.04. However, the global age-standardized incidence rate also decreased, with an EAPC of -0.04. Using the BAPC model, forecasts indicate a rising trend in both global and Chinese schizophrenia prevalence, incidence, and DALYs from 2020 to 2030. By 2030, the global age-standardized prevalence, incidence, and DALYs are projected to reach 280.36, 15.59, and 177.31 per 100,000, respectively. In China, these rates are expected to reach 332.58, 19.87, and 216.67 per 100,000. Conclusion: The global burden of schizophrenia is increasing, particularly in China, where the trend is especially pronounced. In response to this trend, Mental health education and early identification measures should be promoted for high-burden populations, especially young adults aged 20–34, while mental health support services for men should be strengthened and more gender-sensitive treatment and rehabilitation pathways should be designed. As future burden projections continue to rise, policymakers should optimize resource allocation, accordingly, incorporate research data into mental health planning, and improve accessibility and equity of services for key populations, in order to promote more targeted intervention strategies and effectively alleviate the social and family burden of schizophrenia. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Mental health literacy plays a pivotal role in subjective well-being. However, this has rarely been examined among Chinese secondary vocational school students using a person-oriented method. To address this gap, the present study explores subtypes of mental health literacy and reveal their association with subjective well-being (life satisfaction, positive affect and negative affect). The Universal Mental Health Literacy Scale for Adolescents, the Satisfaction with Life Scale and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule were administrated to 925 adolescents recruited from four Chinese secondary vocational schools. The subtypes were examined using latent class analysis, and the relationship between subjective well-being and latent class membership was analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance. The three groups and their probabilities were identified: “high mental health literacy” group, “high knowledge-low attitude” group and “low knowledge-low attitude” group. In the dimensions of subjective well-being (life satisfaction, positive affect and negative affect), “high mental health literacy” group performed better among three groups, and both “low knowledge-low attitude” group and “high knowledge-low attitude” group displayed comparable and lowest levels of life satisfaction and positive affect, as well as the highest level of negative affect. These findings revealed the population heterogeneity of mental health literacy in secondary vocational school students, and provided significant implications for future research and the development of interventions. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.

AB  - Background: Loneliness, a key factor in wellbeing, is under-researched within migrant communities. This study examines loneliness among the Assyrian-Australian diaspora, an ethnoreligious group with a prolonged history of persecution and role of generational differences. Methods: An online survey of 210 Assyrian-Australian adults measured socio-demographic variables and loneliness using the UCLA Loneliness Scale. Results: Findings demonstrated that approximately 65.7% of participants reported moderately high to high degrees of loneliness which was influenced by generation (higher rates of loneliness among second generation) and socio-demographic variables such as age (increased loneliness was noted in the younger participants from second generation and older participants from first generation) and poorer self-reported general health. Participants suggested addressing loneliness through nationalistic activities, mental health education, peer support, and social infrastructure. Conclusion: These findings highlight the importance of understanding the relationship between loneliness in specific Assyrian-Australian subgroups and provides directions to inform the delivery of targeted psychosocial interventions and future research within this community. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Background: The high prevalence rate of adolescent mental health problems is a widespread global concern. Educational professionals in secondary education are in a prime position to address this but often lack knowledge and competencies regarding mental health (‘mental health literacy’) for this. We developed LEARN-NL, an internet-based self-paced intervention that is promising to improve mental health literacy among educational professionals. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of the LEARN-NL intervention in terms of acceptability, implementation, and preliminary effectiveness. Methods: We performed a mixed methods feasibility study with n = 29 educational professionals in the Netherlands. Questionnaires on educational professionals’ mental health literacy, assessed by the Mental Health Literacy and Capacity Survey for Educators (MHLCSE) and subscales of the Knowledge and Attitudes to Mental Health Scales (KAMHS), were administered before and after the intervention to assess preliminary effectiveness of LEARN-NL. We further interviewed participants (n = 9) after completing the intervention to assess acceptability and implementation. Quantitative data were analyzed pre- vs. post-training, qualitative data with thematic analysis. Results: The LEARN-NL intervention was perceived by the educational professionals that completed the training as acceptable and useful, especially in terms of three main themes: (1) Participant satisfaction, (2) rich diversity of topics covered, and (3) better mental health literacy of educational professionals to support adolescents. LEARN-NL could be implemented as planned and we identified two main themes: (1) Format, and (2) conditions for broad implementation and impact. We further found preliminary effectiveness of LEARN-NL intervention in increasing mental health literacy of educational professionals, in terms of self-perceived awareness, knowledge, and comfort, and decreased stigma (p < 0.001). Conclusions: LEARN-NL is feasible as it is acceptable and implementable as planned for improving mental health literacy of educational professionals and shows promising preliminary effectiveness. Larger-scale effectiveness studies should be performed to further investigate the intervention. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Background: Patients undergoing postoperative chemotherapy for colorectal cancer often have long-term and complex care needs, which places a significant physical and psychological burden on their primary caregivers. Sense of coherence (SOC) may help alleviate this burden by fostering correct perceptions and a positive mindset. This study aimed to analyze the trajectory of caregiver burden and the predictive role of SOC among primary caregivers of CRC patients. Methods: A longitudinal survey was conducted from November 2021 to November 2022 in the oncology departments of three Class A tertiary hospitals in Suzhou. The survey was collected at four time points: before the first chemotherapy, after the first chemotherapy, in the middle of the chemotherapy, and after the last chemotherapy. The Sense of Coherence scale and the Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview were used. Growth Mixture Modeling classified potential trajectories of caregiver burden, and logistic regression assessed the influence of SOC on these. Results: 204 primary caregivers of CRC patients completed the survey. The overall caregiver burden showed an initial increase and subsequent decrease, being most severe at T2 and least severe at T4. Caregiver burden trajectories were categorized into low and high caregiving burden groups (P < 0.01). SOC was moderate (65.52 ± 14.75) and was negatively associated with the trajectory of caregiver burden (OR = 0.955, 95% CI: 0.927–0.985). Factors significantly linked to the high-burden group included having one child, low education, being the patient’s child, having other family members to care for, lacking alternative caregivers, and caregiving ≥ 12 h daily (all P < 0.01). Conclusion: A lower SOC can exacerbate the primary caregiver burden. Healthcare professionals should pay special attention to primary caregivers who have low education, have one child, are the children of patients, are responsible for caring for other family members, and lack alternative caregivers. Timely interventions should be initiated to provide appropriate support, such as mental health education, SOC training, cognitive therapy, and other interventions. These efforts aim to enhance SOC levels and reduce the caregiver burden, thereby promoting the overall well-being of primary caregivers. Clinical trial number: Not applicable. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Background: Brief Admission by self-referral (BA) was implemented in 2018 in Swedish child and adolescent psychiatric (CAP) inpatient care. This intervention empowers adolescents to self-admit at their own request for brief periods to prevent self-harm and suicidal crisis. As BA enhances healthcare user autonomy, it is a timely intervention to consider with the emerging human rights discourse and rising imperatives for person-centered care in psychiatry. The present study explores talk about adolescents access to BA specifically in terms of involvement and responsibilities of parents and other significant adults in CAP. Methods: In this qualitative study, we interviewed 26 significant adults (the majority being biological parents) of children with access to BA. Interviews were semi-structured, asking broadly about participants’ experiences with BA. We used reflexive thematic analysis from a social constructionist framework to explore how participants’ narratives drew on existing psychiatric discourses. Results: We constructed four themes around narratives of involvement and responsibilities in BA specifically and CAP generally: there’s no need to be involved in BA, selflessly supporting child involvement, being insufficiently involved, and being left to shoulder everything. These themes illustrate a sliding scale from perceiving little responsibility nor need for involvement, to perceiving shared responsibility for children’s well-being but limited personal rights, to being under-involved and even perceptions of being left with sole responsibility as CAP refused to provide care. Conclusions: Participants’ narratives could generally be mapped onto rights-based discourse, emphasizing that adolescents should have access to BA as it helped them care for themselves. As participants took various positions regarding the responsibility of parents versus CAP to protect and help adolescents, the risk of perpetually downplaying the needs of parents and other significant adults became apparent, along with the pitfalls of neoliberal healthcare management and responsibilization of child mental health. CAP ought to systematically inform both adolescents and significant adults about BA, strengthening mental health literacy among the target population. It also ought to be emphasized that supporting significant others is considered part of the purpose with BA. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Background: The mental health of young adults is deteriorating. Reasons for this are manifold, ranging from biological factors (e.g. entering a vulnerable developmental phase) to crisis-related external events (e.g. COVID-19 pandemic). Accordingly, easily accessible and universal prevention for the young is needed. Mobile Health (mHealth) interventions are on the rise and especially promising for this age group, due to numerous benefits, such as low threshold, temporal and local flexibility and high scalability. However, the effectiveness and acceptance of mHealth interventions as prevention measures are missing empirical evidence. Method: In a two-arm randomised controlled trial design, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a mental health app, the ‘Mental Health Guide’, primarily on mental health literacy as well as secondary mental health outcomes. N = 322 Participants (81.99 % female, M = 25.55 years, SD = 9.63 years, age range: 15 to 59 years) were either assigned to the intervention group (n = 158), using the Mental Health Guide for 12 weeks, or the wait-list control group (n = 164). Results: The results show a significant intervention effect on mental health literacy for the intervention group in the post assessment (p = .047, d = 0.20), but no at later follow-up time points. Further variables related to mental health indicate various effects, such as improved problematic (p = .018, d = 0.20) and prosocial behaviour (p = .008, d = 0.23) in the intervention group and improved emotion regulation capacities for both groups (p < .001, d = 0.20). Overall, there was a high drop-out rate in the study (up to 80 %), especially in the intervention group. Conclusion: This study contributes valuable insights into the potential effectiveness of mHealth prevention in young adults and gives insights on how such applications are used under very naturalistic settings, laying a foundation for future research in this field. However, generalisability is limited due to selective sample characteristics and a rather high drop-out rate over time. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - Objective: The objective is to explore the barriers and facilitators experienced by mental health care professionals in providing mental health services to Omani children and adolescents. Methods: A qualitative descriptive study with semi-structured face-to-face interviews was conducted on a purposive sample of sixteen mental health professionals from a tertiary care psychiatric hospital in Oman. Audio recordings were transcribed verbatim, and the anonymized transcripts were processed with Delve Tool, a qualitative data analysis software that streamlines thematic analysis. Results: Barriers to access mental health services were- institutional system and policy limitations; specialized workforce deficiency; lack of systemic interagency coordination; logistical barriers, language barriers, resistance to treatment, inefficient facility design, and cultural stigma. Facilitators were - integrated team-based care; telemedicine and public awareness campaigns; existing expertise and integrated services model. Conclusion: This study highlights the urgent need for action in ways to expand mental health education, and breakdown the stigma that often prevents people from seeking help. By integrating care models and ensuring that professionals receive ongoing training, the existing gaps can be closed and mental health services can be made more effective. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Mental health disorders typically emerge in early life and can be modified through prompt intervention. Mental health literacy is the multi-dimensional knowledge of mental health disorders to recognize, manage, or prevent mental health disorders. Enhancing youth mental health literacy through information communication technologies already adopted by youth may be an accessible and effective approach to address the ongoing mental health crisis. We used an interconnected, three phase process following co-design methods to determine evidence-based consensus statements to conceptualize and develop the Youth MindTrack and to inform future digital tools to support youth mental health literacy. In Phase I, a scientific team (N = 21; 24% youth) adhered to deliberative dialogue and priority setting methods to develop strategic priorities. Phase II consisted of a modified Delphi consensus process to determine evidence-based consensus statements (N = 352 (13% youth) Round 1; N = 87 (33% youth) Round 2). Semi-structured focus groups in Phase III were conducted to refine the consensus statements (N = 16, 25% youth) and design the digital mental health literacy tool (N = 24, 33% youth). Twenty-one consensus statements encompassing four domains were produced: (1) Understanding mental health (N = 4); (2) Exercising mental health (N = 6); (3) Engaging with digital support (N = 8); and (4) Evaluating digital support (N = 3). Content analysis of discussions identified 16 themes mapped to the domains of mental health literacy and user-interface, design considerations for digital tools on mental health literacy more broadly. The resulting design of the Youth MindTrack tool to support mental health literacy included four main interactive sections designed to be downloaded and completed by youth on a digital device. We determined 21 evidence-based consensus statements that underpinned the conceptualization and development of the Youth MindTrack: a downloadable digital tool to support youth mental health literacy. The data supports proceeding to pilot testing to assess the tool’s usability, acceptability, and perceived effectiveness prior to implementation, and provides evidence that an iterative and participatory research-based process with youth can help adapt health technology to their needs. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Background: Integrating mental health education into undergraduate nursing curricula is essential for equipping primary health care nurses to effectively address mental health challenges. Despite the growing burden of mental health disorders in South Africa, nursing graduates often lack sufficient mental health training, limiting their ability to provide holistic care. This study investigated the perspectives of nurse educators and preceptors and nursing students on the integration of mental health in nursing education. Methods: An exploratory case study design was employed. Data were collected through individual interviews guided by a structured interview schedule. Participants – comprising purposefully selected nurse educators, nurse preceptors, and undergraduate nursing students – were drawn from a South African nursing education institution. Data collection occurred between October and November 2023. Thematic analysis was conducted to distil key perspectives from the interviews. Results: Three central themes emerged: The first theme was “curriculum and teaching challenges”– Educators faced difficulties in bridging theory and practice due to limited hands-on training opportunities. While innovative teaching methods had previously enhanced learning, ethical and emotional concerns arose when students shared subjective experiences. The second theme was “students’ attitudes and preparedness”– Initially, students exhibited indifference toward mental health care, but clinical exposure gradually shifted their perceptions. However, emotional unpreparedness and fear of psychiatric settings hindered their learning experiences. The third theme was “suggestions for strengthening mental health care integration”– Participants advocated for enriched theoretical content, increased clinical hours, early and continuous exposure to mental health care, structured emotional debriefing sessions, and short courses aimed at enhancing practical competence and student support. Conclusion: This study highlights the disparity between ideal mental health education and the reality within South African undergraduate nursing curricula. Educators, preceptors, and students emphasised the need for comprehensive training reforms, including early exposure, extended practical hours, structured emotional support, and mentorship. Such measures could foster a more realistic approach to mental health nursing and better prepare graduates to deliver integrated mental health care within primary health care settings.

AB  - This study explores methods to improve internalizing problems in middle school students through physical exercise, aiming to construct a mediational model that includes physical exercise, Rumination, peer acceptance, and internalizing problems. The model examines the interactions and influence pathways among these variables to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanism through which physical exercise impacts internalizing problems in middle school students. 671 junior high school students were surveyed by physical exercise scale, Rumination scale, peer acceptance scale and internalization question scale. SPSS26.0 was used to analyze the data, followed by descriptive analysis, reliability analysis, Pearson correlation analysis, Harman single factor test and Bootstrap analysis. (1) Physical exercise was negatively correlated with internalizing problems (r = − 0.286), but the direct path between physical exercise and internalizing problems was not statistically significant (β = − 0.060, p > 0.05, CI [− 0.137, 0.018]); (2) Physical exercise was significantly negatively correlated with Rumination (β = − 0.174, p < 0.001, CI [− 0.255, − 0.094]) and significantly positively correlated with peer acceptance (β = 0.357, p < 0.001, CI [0.286, 0.429]). Rumination was significantly negatively correlated with peer acceptance (β = − 0.128, p < 0.001, CI [− 0.199, − 0.056]) and significantly positively correlated with internalizing problems (β = 0.289, p < 0.001, CI [0.222, 0.356]); peer acceptance was significantly negatively correlated with internalizing problems (β = − 0.372, p < 0.001, CI [− 0.448, − 0.296]). (3) The total effect of the chain mediation model was − 0.251, and the direct effect of physical exercise and internalized problems was − 0.059,The total effect accounted for 23.51%, Rumination and Peer acceptance played a mediating role between physical exercise and internalized behavior problems, and the total indirect effect size was − 0.192, The total effect accounted for 76.49%. The mediating effect values of Rumination and Peer acceptance between physical exercise and internalized behavior problems were − 0.050 and − 0.133, accounting for 19.92% and 52.99%, respectively. The chain-mediated effect between Rumination and Peer acceptance between physical exercise and internalized behavior problems was − 0.008, and the chain-mediated effect accounted for 3.19%. Physical exercise is negatively correlated with internalization, Rumination is negatively correlated with peer acceptance; Rumination and peer acceptance, as mediating variables, not only play an independent mediating role between physical exercise and junior high school students’ internalization problems, but also further strengthen their role in junior high school students’ internalization problems through chain mediation. Although the effect value of chain mediation is small, it is worthy of attention, suggesting that there is a synergistic effect among the variables. The results of this study provide an important reference for the design of school physical exercise curriculum. Through reasonable design of physical education curriculum, the interest and attraction of physical exercise can be increased, and the participation of students can be improved indirectly, thus promoting the improvement of internalization problems. At the same time, it can be considered to combine physical exercise with mental health education, and cultivate students’ methods and abilities to cope with pressure and negative emotions through physical exercise courses, cultivate positive and optimistic attitude, and improve junior middle school students’ mental toughness and social adaptability. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Paramedicine is a psychologically high-risk profession, with workers routinely exposed to fatalities and severe medical and emotional trauma. During their studies, paramedicine students undergo practical training with ambulance crews. Without experience, and often with limited emotional preparation, students are exposed to many of the same graphic and traumatic situations as working professionals. This qualitative social constructionist study explored the emotional impacts experienced during placement and students’ emotional preparedness to cope with the challenges of placement. Findings revealed a range of significant emotional impacts reported by the participants. Initial anxiety was found to intensify the response to distressing incidents involving fatalities, severe injuries, domestic violence, and suicide-related incidents. In some cases, students reported ongoing, lingering emotional effects. Most students also felt that they were inadequately prepared for the emotional challenges of placement. A common recommendation among the participants was the inclusion of formal mental health education and resilience training prior to placement. Given the prior absence of research exploring the lived experiences of paramedic students on placement, the current findings add important depth and a student perspective. The implications of this research highlight an urgent need for a greater focus on students’ emotional preparedness prior to placement training. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Background: Meaningful involvement of young People with Lived Experience (PWLE) in co-designing youth mental health interventions has been much emphasized globally. However, there is a scarcity of evidence on involving PWLE of mental health problems in designing, implementing and evaluating mental health interventions, especially in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). The aim of the current study was to understand the perspectives of young PWLE from two South Asian countries, Pakistan and India, regarding “Active Ingredients” (AIs) for youth mental health (i.e., components or processes of mental health intervention(s) that make a difference to mental health outcomes), as part of the Wellcome Trust AI Commission. Methods: For this exploratory qualitative study, we conducted 30 qualitative interviews via Zoom with young PWLE from Pakistan (n = 19, 14 females and 5 males) and India (n = 11, 8 females and 3 males) to explore their views about different AIs for youth anxiety and depression in South Asia. The qualitative data was analysed using a thematic analysis approach that moved through the phases of familiarization, generation of codes, searching, identification and review of themes and selection of illustrative quotes. Results: The results show that family and religion are integral to promoting positive youth mental health in the South Asian context. The AIs perceived to be most relevant for Pakistani and Indian young people were (i) improving social relationships; (ii) managing emotions; and (iii) relaxation techniques. Participants highlighted the need to explore the role of family support, personal space, spirituality/religion, schools, mental health literacy and stigma as potential AIs of mental health for young people in South Asia. The need for ease of access to mental health support and minimizing barriers to engagement with mental health services were highlighted as important contextual factors. Our findings highlight the need for culturally responsive youth mental health strategies that incorporate their preferred intervention components and address key challenges including stigma faced by South Asian youth. Conclusions: The current study highlights specific intervention components and contextual considerations that are important to Indian and Pakistani young PWLE when designing and delivering mental health interventions. Our findings underscore the need to work with young PWLE and consider their context, culture, and resources when developing or evaluating mental health interventions. Given our sample likely represents a relatively advantaged group, future studies can use targeted sampling strategies to capture perspectives of young people from lower socio-economic strata. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Objective: Programs using heroes to promote positive health and educational outcomes for children and adolescents have been increasingly implemented. However, a comprehensive review of such interventions is lacking. This scoping review maps the existing empirical literature on hero-based interventions. Method: A systematic search of databases including CINAHL, ERIC, MEDLINE, and others (final search February 2025), covering all years up to January 2025 identified peer-reviewed studies in English on hero-based interventions targeting health or educational outcomes in children and adolescents. Exclusions in-cluded non-English papers, those lacking empirical results, focusing on adults, or classified as grey literature. Data on study characteristics were extracted and analyzed using Arksey and O'Malley's (2005) framework. Results: From 134 screened articles, 39 met the inclusion criteria, identifying 11 distinct programs targeting diverse populations across regions such as the U.S., U.K., India, Turkey, and Japan. These programs, im-plemented in both educational and clinical settings, addressed physical and mental health, education, social skills, and trauma recovery. The review assessed empirical support for these programs, noting variability in evidence strength, and highlighted their adaptability across different cultural contexts. Conclusions: Hero-based interventions show promise in supporting youth across various outcomes, though no universal approach exists. Tailoring interventions to the specific cultural and contextual needs of young people is essential. Future research should focus on refining these methods, matching heroes to participants, and independent replication. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - Background: Test anxiety is a common form of situational anxiety among adolescents, which can seriously affect their academic performance and mental health. Guided by Emotion Regulation Theory and Social Support Theory, this study explores the mechanism by which mindfulness influences adolescent test anxiety, introducing music therapy and social support as chained mediators. Method: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted among 372 adolescents from a secondary school in China. Measurement tools included the Mindfulness Scale, Music Therapy Perception Scale, Social Support Scale, and Test Anxiety Scale. Correlation analysis was performed using SPSS 26.0, and chained mediation analysis was conducted using the PROCESS macro (Model 6). Results: The results showed that mindfulness had a significant negative effect on adolescent test anxiety (β = -0.349, p < 0.001). Music therapy mediated the relationship between mindfulness and test anxiety, with an indirect effect of -0.074 (95% CI [-0.109, -0.042]), accounting for 12.1% of the total effect. Social support also served as an independent mediator (β = -0.161, 95% CI [-0.216, -0.112]), explaining 26.2% of the total effect. In addition, music therapy and social support jointly played a chained mediating role (β = -0.029, 95% CI [-0.049, -0.014]), accounting for 4.8% of the total effect. Conclusion: Mindfulness can alleviate adolescent test anxiety both directly and indirectly through music therapy and social support. This study reveals the potential mechanisms of mindfulness-based interventions and provides theoretical and practical implications for school-based mental health education. Especially in resource-limited settings, promoting mindfulness training and music therapy appears to be a feasible and valuable intervention strategy. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Introduction: Mental health education is essential for preparing healthcare professionals to address the growing needs of patients with mental health challenges. The aim of this study was to understand the current landscape of teaching and learning approaches to mental health education for undergraduate health profession students. Methodology: A realist review was chosen to explore what works for whom, how, and why in teaching and learning for mental health education for undergraduate health profession students. The search strategy was developed iteratively, with support from a research librarian, and additional searches supplemented the initial search. Following screening in duplicate, the selected studies were appraised for relevance, richness and rigour. Intervention (I), Context (C), Actor (A), Mechanism (M) and Outcome (O) configurations were extracted from the data and analysed for patterns and conceptual areas. Stakeholder and Patient and Public Involvement panels supported the refinement of both the Initial Programme Theory (IPT) and Programme Theories (PT). Results: 78 articles were included. The results identified three critical program theories: (1) direct contact with individuals with lived experience (2), longitudinal and integrative learning approach, and (3) diversity of experiential and community-engaged learning. Integrating these theories into health education curricula may lead to professionals better prepared to address mental health challenges. Conclusion: Our realist review identified three critical programme theories for teaching and learning strategies that foster this literacy, including direct engagement with individuals who have lived experiences, a longitudinal and integrative approach to education, and a diverse array of experiential and community-engaged learning opportunities. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Background: Pesticide poisoning has emerged as a significant public health concern on a global scale. China has a diverse range of agricultural practices and varying pesticide usage across its regions. Nevertheless, there is a paucity of research on the epidemiology of pesticide poisoning in China. To address this research gap, our study was undertaken to investigate the epidemiological characteristics of pesticide poisoning in Zhejiang Province. Methods: Pesticide poisoning data for Zhejiang Province from 2008 to 2022 was extracted from the National Occupational Disease and Occupational Health Information Monitoring System. A descriptive statistical analysis had been employed to explore the temporal, demographic, and regional distribution of pesticide poisoning cases. Furthermore, logistic regression models were conducted to analyze the influence factors of pesticide-related death. Results: Between the years 2008 and 2022, totally 64,605 pesticide poisoning cases were observed in Zhejiang Province, with a case fatality rate of 5.28%. The incidence rate was estimated as 7.23 per 100,000 population. The poisoning cases number, incidence rates and the case fatality rates all exhibited fluctuating decreasing trends during the study period. Intentional poisoning (suicide) accounted for 64.64% of all poisoning cases, and the case fatality rate of intentional poisoning cases were also significantly higher than occupational and accidental poisoning. In examining the influence factors of pesticide-related death, it was revealed that older individuals, males, and those experiencing either accidental or intentional poisoning had higher risk of death. The analysis also identified that patients treated in township level hospitals exhibited a higher risk of death compared with those in district/county level or provincial/municipal level primary care hospitals. Conclusions: The current situation of pesticide poisoning in Zhejiang Province remains severe and the government should further strengthen the monitoring and governing of pesticide. Moreover, it is imperative that mental health education and early psycho-social interventions be given greater emphasis to effectively reduce pesticide-related suicides. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Background: Military personnel face more stresses and challenges, and they are at greater risk of insomnia compared to the general population. Mental health is one of the primary ways of managing insomnia. However, there are few studies regarding the mediator in the two variables among this population. This study aimed to investigate the insomnia, mental health literacy, and mental health in young soldiers, to explore the correlation of the three variables and to verify the mediating role of mental health literacy between mental health and insomnia. Methods: The cross-sectional study was conducted from March 2023 to March 2024. A total of 2375 soldiers was surveyed using the General Information Questionnaire, Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), 12-Item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), and National Mental Health Literacy Questionnaire (NMHLQ). The data were processed using descriptive analysis, Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis H test, Spearman’s correlation analysis, stepwise regression analysis, and a mediation analysis. Results: The questionnaire of 2297 participants was valid with an effective rate of 96.72%. The majority of participants were male (2281, 99.30%). The mean age of participants was 23.49 ± 2.51years (range 18–35). The total score of ISI was 1 (0, 5), with a high occurrence rate of insomnia at 14.85%. The mental health displayed a significant positive correlation with insomnia (r = 0.333, P<0.001). Furthermore, the mental health literacy and its two dimensions—NMHLQ-mental health awareness (NMHLQ-A) and NMHLQ-identification and response to mental illness (NMHLQ-I) exhibited significant negative correlations with both mental health and insomnia (r=-0.346∽-0.074, P<0.001). Before and after adjusted control variables, the NMHLQ-A and NMHLQ-I played partial mediating role between mental health and insomnia, and the mediating effect ratios attributable to the NMHLQ-A were 17.79% and 17.41%, whereas to the NMHLQ-I were 2.33% and 2.20%. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the potential negative impacts of mental health literacy on the insomnia of young soldiers directly and indirectly. Especially, NMHLQ-A and NMHLQ-I play partial mediating role between mental health and insomnia. According to these findings, Psychological service workers can develop and implement highly individualized effective interventions to improve young soldiers’ mental health and sleep quality. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to explore the association between health risk behaviors (HRBs) and multiple psychological symptoms, including depressive symptoms, post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), and sleep problems, among Chinese adolescents, and to analyze the moderating role of mental health literacy (MHL) in the aforementioned relationship. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted online from October 12 to November 5, 2023. Questionnaires were distributed and retrieved via a web-based platform, with 22,264 subjects included in the final analysis. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify clustered HRBs pattern, and multivariate logistic regression was applied to investigate the relationships among HRBs pattern, quantity, and multiple psychological symptoms. Results: Adolescents in the high-risk and irregular lifestyle groups were more likely to suffer from a range of psychological symptoms compared to those in the low-risk HRBs group. Specifically, the odds ratio (OR) for the high-risk group was 6.15 (95 % CI = [4.664, 8.118]) for all three psychological symptoms, 4.08 (95 % CI = [3.248, 5.132]) for any two symptoms, and 2.87 (95 % CI = [2.418, 3.409]) for any one symptom. The irregular lifestyle group displayed a similar trend. Moreover, an increase in the number of HRBs was associated with a higher probability of exhibiting all levels of psychological symptoms. MHL significantly mitigated the relationship between HRBs and multiple psychological symptoms, especially by enhancing help-seeking behavior and reducing stigma associated with mental health issues. Conclusions: The findings suggested that interventions aimed at reducing HRBs and improving MHL can contribute to the mental health development in adolescents. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Mental Health Literacy (MHL) is pivotal for understanding and addressing mental disorders, often assessed using the comprehensive Mental Health Literacy Scale (MHLS) across six dimensions and 35 items. However, research on MHL within Arab populations is not just scarce, but alarmingly so, indicating a significant gap in knowledge regarding MHL in this demographic. This study aimed to fill this gap by adapting the MHLS into Arabic and evaluating its psychometric properties among three distinct Arabic-speaking groups: adolescents, students, and the general public. Data were collected using the translated MHLS, the General Health Questionnaire, and sociodemographic measures, employing a cross-sectional design. Validation procedures were conducted, including exploratory factor analysis, reliability testing, and face validity assessment. Construct validity was assessed using Pearson correlation analysis and t-tests. The validation process yielded three modified versions of the MHLS in Arabic: MHLS-Arabic-Adolescents (31 items, 5 factors), MHLS-Arabic-Students (30 items, 6 factors), and MHLS-Arabic-General Public (33 items, 5 factors). These tools demonstrated robust construct validity and high-reliability coefficients and stood as a testament to their adaptability and potential for use in diverse Arabic-speaking populations. This study suggests the nuanced nature of MHL and points to the importance of micro-context-specific validation. Providing three reliable MHLS Arabic versions could facilitate research on MHL among Arabic-speaking populations worldwide, potentially leading to tailored intervention initiatives that aim to enhance mental health outcomes and ensure equitable access to services within Arab communities globally. © 2025 Abo-Rass et al.

AB  - Background: It is essential that leaders in education and behavioral health partner with youth to build Comprehensive School Mental Health (CSMH) systems. One mechanism to elevate youth perspectives in CSMH system building is by engaging youth as members of CSMH teams. Method: The current study describes the structure, process and impact of a school-based Youth Leadership Academy (YLA) that integrated youth leaders into CSMH teams with state, district, and school leaders. The YLA offered student leaders opportunities to (1) receive training and mentorship to enhance their capacities to serve as leaders on CSMH teams, (2) provide input on CSMH priorities and (3) set MTSS goals to advance emotional well-being in schools. This study summarizes youth-driven multi-tiered systems of support (MTSS) goals and action plans by youth participants and the impact of youth participation in the YLA on indicators of positive youth development. Results: Youth most often contributed to planning and/or implementation of Tier 1-Universal Mental Health supports related to mental health literacy and school climate. Pre-post surveys revealed YLA participation was associated with statistically significant increases in youth reports of core social and emotional learning skills, positive identity, and contribution. Conclusions: Schools can replicate the YLA structure to enhance MTSS and foster youth leader skill development. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: Parents' knowledge, understanding and attitudes have a strong influence on treatment outcomes in child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP). However, little is known about parents' knowledge, perceptions and awareness regarding assessment, intervention and treatment options in CAP. Methods: We evaluated 1872 parents (1104 mothers [59.0%], 768 fathers [41.0%]) who were over 18 years of age and had at least one child between the ages of 0–18, regardless of whether their child had previously received CAP treatment, using a questionnaire containing 29 questions. Results: The most common misconceptions about CAP application records were that psychiatric records would cause difficulties in getting a job (92.6%) and would be obstacles to appointment to civil service (65.8%) and to getting driver's licence (34.8%). Regarding CAP drug treatments, the most frequently reported false beliefs were that psychiatric drugs cause weight gain (80.1%), are addictive (65.1%), cause long-lasting side effects (53.5%), numb the mind and cause drowsiness (52.7%), alter children's personalities (44.4%) and increase suicide risk (42.9%). Furthermore, 1105 (59.0%) participants answered ‘Psychiatric disorders cannot be treated effectively even if psychiatric medications are used.’. Conclusions: Our results indicated that parents' knowledge level was inadequate, and their attitudes and beliefs were negative and limited regarding CAP and treatments; in turn, they avoided treatment and did not engage in help-seeking behaviours. This study shows an urgent need for mental health education programs to increase parents' awareness and understanding of CAP and promote appropriate access to services. © 2025 International Society for Developmental Neuroscience.

AB  - Introduction: Fewer than half of those with a mental health condition seek professional support. Formal help-seeking is associated with mental health literacy and perceived need for care, which rely on the ability to accurately recognise one's own mental health. While poor self-recognition may present a significant barrier to service use, factors influencing problem-identification remain understudied. This investigation aimed to identify targets to improve self-recognition and increase formal help-seeking behaviour. Methods: This study used a cross-sectional survey of 1135 Australian adults with mental health conditions. Participants completed DSM-5 symptom checklists and screening tools for depression, anxiety, social phobia, panic disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder, and reported their subjective experience of each condition. Adjusted logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with poor self-recognition and formal help-seeking. Results: Poor self-recognition was exhibited by 19 % of participants and was significantly associated with older age, comorbidity and lower symptom severity. Those with poor self-recognition had 18 % lower odds of formal help-seeking compared to those with accurate self-recognition. This association was not significant based on DSM-5 symptom checklists (AOR = 0.82, 95 % CI: 0.57–1.17), but was significant using screening tools (AOR = 0.76, 95 % CI: 0.59–0.97). Formal help-seeking was significantly associated with informal help-seeking, older age, English language and greater symptom severity. Conclusion: Targeted strategies to improve self-recognition, particularly among older adults, could enhance service utilisation and reduce the mental health treatment gap. Additionally, informal supports and community-based interventions have the potential to promote early symptom recognition, facilitating more effective mental health management. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - Background. Despite the high prevalence of mental disorders, knowledge about mental health, its promotion, prevention, and pathways to care in the general population remain limited. Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) seeks to increase mental health literacy in the general population and enable individuals to support others with mental health problems until professional help is available. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility and initial effects of MHFA training on (i) mental health literacy, (ii) stigmatizing attitudes toward individuals with mental health problems, (iii) social distance, (iv) trainees’ mental health, and (v) quality of life. Methods. In an uncontrolled pilot study, individuals aged 18–75 years who participated in MHFA courses in Germany were recruited. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, post-training, and 6-month follow-up. Results. In total, 362 participants (mean age 43 years, 78% female) enrolled in the study at baseline. Retention was about 50% for post-training and 60% for follow-up assessment. At post-training, mental health literacy was increased (<inf>adj</inf>Β = 6.77, 95% CI = 5.69 to 7.84) and social distance (<inf>adj</inf>Β = −2.30, 95% CI = −2.73 to −1.87) and stigmatizing attitudes (<inf>adj</inf>Β = −2.61, 95% CI = −3.25 to −1.97) were reduced. These effects were also evident at 6-month follow-up. There were no effects on trainees’ mental health. At the 6-month follow-up, 89% of trainees had talked to someone with mental health problems at least once, and 65% of trainees were quite or very confident in offering help. Conclusions. Our findings suggest initial beneficial effects of MHFA training as implemented in Germany. A randomized controlled trial of MHFA in Germany is now warranted. © The Author(s), 2025.

AB  - Perinatal mental health disorders, especially depression and anxiety, are prevalent among women in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), including Indonesia. These conditions can affect both maternal well-being and child development. This systematic review aimed to identify and synthesize key risk factors associated with perinatal mental health disorders among women in Indonesia. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar for quantitative studies published between 2015 and 2024. Inclusion criteria included studies involving pregnant or postpartum women in Indonesia, using quantitative designs, and reporting on risk factors for depression and/or anxiety. The review followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Data extraction and screening were conducted manually by reviewers. Out of 434 identified records, six studies met the inclusion criteria. Most employed cross-sectional designs focused on sociodemographic, psychosocial, obstetric, and psychological factors. Common risk factors included young maternal age, low education, unstable employment, lack of social support, and history of mental illness. Several studies also identified low mental health literacy and poor maternal-fetal attachment as contributing factors. The included studies were mostly cross-sectional, limiting causal inference. This review highlights the need for routine mental health screening, greater provider training, and community-based interventions in maternal health care. Future research should prioritize longitudinal designs and assess the effectiveness of policy implementation. © 2025, Universitas Negeri Semarang. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: School-aged children with unidentified mental illnesses experience poor health outcomes; managing this issue requires a collaborative community approach. Objectives: The objective was to implement an evidence-based mental health education and sustainment program within an underresourced school setting for staff and parents/guardians supervising children to optimize adult mental health literacy (MHL). Methods: The intervention included Youth Mental Health First Aid (YMHFA) training; measurements of pre- and post-MHL were completed with the Mental Health Literacy Scale (MHLS). Sustainment was achieved by developing a school-centered mental health toolkit and integrating a school champion. Results: There was a significant MHL score change from pretest to posttest. The toolkit bolstered sustainability by increasing the utilization of community resources. Conclusions: This mental health awareness initiative proved effective and can be expanded across similar underresourced schools to fill voids. © The Author(s) 2024

AB  - Background/Objective: Childhood obesity and mental health disorders in preschool-aged children represent critical public health challenges with a rising global prevalence, closely linked to lifestyle behaviors and the family environment. This cross-sectional study aims to investigate the combined influence of maternal sociodemographic, socioeconomic, anthropometric characteristics, and lifestyle factors on the physical and mental health status of preschool-aged children. Methods: Validated questionnaires were administered to assess dietary habits, psychosocial parameters (depression, anxiety, stress), and sociodemographic, socioeconomic, and anthropometric variables among 200 preschool-aged children and their mothers, who served as the primary informants. Results: Maternal obesity was associated with a higher prevalence of childhood overweight/obesity (36.7% vs. 18.5% in children of non-obese mothers, p = 0.009). Maternal psychological factors, specifically depressive symptoms (B = 0.998, OR = 2.712, 95% CI: 1.222–6.020, p = 0.014) and anxiety (B = 1.676, OR = 5.346, 95% CI: 2.471–11.565, p < 0.001), were independently associated with an increased likelihood of child anxiety. Anthropometric measures, including waist circumference (p = 0.032) and hip circumference (p = 0.031), primarily influenced children’s physical health, whereas maternal psychological factors predominantly affected their emotional well-being. Conclusions: The findings underscore the necessity for targeted interventions focusing on enhancing maternal nutrition and mental health literacy, aiming to promote healthy dietary patterns, physical activity, and lifestyle behaviors. Such interventions are pivotal for preventing childhood obesity and fostering overall well-being at the population level. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: The global rise in mental health challenges among adolescents has led to the development of targeted interventions, including those designed to promote young people’s understanding and awareness of mental health. This systematic review aims to identify and evaluate interventions implemented among secondary school students with the goal of enhancing mental health literacy, and to assess their effectiveness in achieving this outcome. Methods: This review was partially aligned with the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Studies were retrieved from four electronic databases—CINAHL Complete, PubMed, Academic Search Elite, and ERIC—and supplemented by a limited number of relevant studies identified outside the systematic search. The analysis focused on the content, delivery, design, evaluation methods, and outcomes of mental health literacy (MHL) interventions conducted in secondary schools internationally. Results: A total of 16 articles met the inclusion criteria. The articles described a variety of different MHL interventions (n = 12). The findings indicate that school-based MHL interventions have a positive impact on students’ knowledge and understanding of mental health, but stigma reduction demonstrated less consistent effects. Study population, country, intervention content, delivery, methods, outcome measures, sample sizes and participants’ age range varied notably across the studies. Conclusions: Based on the evidence synthesized in this review, school-based MHL interventions appear to be effective and may serve as a valuable component in broader efforts to promote mental health in adolescence. These findings reinforce existing evidence and provide a foundation for practical implications, but future research is highly recommended for a more solid base of evidence. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Stress is pervasive among medical students, driven by academic pressures, clinical responsibilities and personal challenges. This stress often leads to mental health issues such as anxiety, depression and burnout, exacerbated by the stigma surrounding mental health support. Addressing this stigma is critical to fostering well-being in future healthcare providers. Key themes include the prevalence and sources of stress, the impact of stigma on mental health help-seeking behaviours and innovative programmes integrating mental health education and stigma reduction. Insights are drawn from international practices and evidence-based interventions. Recommendations highlight the need for culturally sensitive and student-centric approaches to create an inclusive and supportive environment. By addressing stigma and enhancing mental health support, institutions can improve medical students’ academic and personal outcomes. © 2025 Nigerian Postgraduate Medical Journal.

AB  - Introduction: Psychosis is a particularly stigmatised condition in adolescent populations, with prevalent stigmatising beliefs surrounding it including negative stereotypes around dangerousness, unpredictability and chronicity. Additionally, the first episodes of psychosis increase significantly during late adolescence, and there is a lack of understanding and recognition of psychosis in young people. Given these factors, psychosis appears to be an important topic for mental health literacy and anti-stigma programmes. However, there is a lack of consensus surrounding the best way to construct psychosis anti-stigma interventions for young people. Voices of people with experience of psychosis seem crucial in this regard, but their experiences of stigma and discrimination are rarely heard. By including their perspectives along with those of other stakeholders, we aim to ensure that we gain a better, more balanced perspective on how to talk about psychosis with young people. Methods: This study reports on the co-design process of a psychosis anti-stigma educational intervention for young people using the short-form Guidance for Reporting Involvement of Patients and the Public (GRIPP-2) checklist as a guiding framework. Six workshops were held over 3 months, with experts with experience of psychosis working with clinicians and academics. These workshops explored the differing views of these groups on how we understand, talk about and perceive psychosis. Results: This process resulted in an educational module named ‘Reality and Psychosis’, which we believe will prove effective in not only educating but also diminishing stigma surrounding psychosis among young people. Conclusion: By incorporating various perspectives, we hope to provide a well-rounded and balanced approach to addressing the complexities of discussing psychosis with young people. The GRIPP-2 checklist also proved to be a useful framework for assisting the reporting process. Patient or Public Contribution: Individuals with lived experience of psychosis participated throughout the co-design process. Specifically, they contributed to the six workshops by sharing their personal experiences of stigma, discrimination and recovery, which informed the development of the educational module. This helped ensure the voices of those directly affected by psychosis were authentically represented. © 2025 The Author(s). Health Expectations published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Senior high school students aged 15–19 are adolescents in the transitional phase from childhood to independent adulthood, during which stress can quickly arise. Developing Mental Health Literacy (MHL) can play a crucial role in preventing severe mental illnesses. This study aimed to explore the MHL and mental well-being of senior high school students in Samut Songkhram Province, Thailand. This descriptive-analytical cross-sectional study was conducted on 510 senior high school students in Samut Songkhram, Thailand, using stratified random sampling. Data were collected using the MHL and mental well-being questionnaire. The Pearson correlation coefficient and linear regression were used for analysis at a significance level of 0.05. This study included 510 senior high school students, the majority of whom were female (57.8%), aged 16 years (30.6%), and in Grade 11 (37.6%). Most students were enrolled in the Science and Mathematics program (57.5%). Regarding academic performance, most of them had grades of 3.01 or higher (53.5%). Most students’ families had incomes between 10,001 and 30,000 THB (49.6%). MHL was at a moderate level, while mental well-being levels were low. A positive relationship was observed between overall MHL scores and mental well-being scores (r = 0.103, p = 0.034). After adjusting for the study program, the overall MHL score was found to be significantly associated with mental well-being scores (Beta = 0.118). However, the overall MHL score showed a significant negative association with mental well-being scores (Beta =-0.137) when adjusted for the school-record program. The study revealed that senior high school students exhibited a moderate level of MHL and a low level of mental well-being. Therefore, extracurricular activities should be implemented to enhance MHL and improve the mental well-being of senior high school students in the future, alongside developing comprehensive strategies to address and prevent mental health issues faced by this group. © 2025, Mahidol University - ASEAN Institute for Health Development.

AB  - Veterinary students often face mental health challenges due to the demanding nature of their studies and the pressures of adapting to their future profession. To address this issue, an animal-assisted education in mental health (AAE-MH) program was developed and implemented at a veterinary school in Hong Kong. The primary goal of the AAE-MH program was to enhance students' mental health literacy, raise awareness of mental health topics, and improve their help-seeking behavior and overall well-being. By leveraging the students' natural affinity for animals, the program incorporated a blend of course-based and experiential learning activities to tackle the often-taboo topic of mental health in the veterinary field. The AAE-MH program consisted of six sessions, each lasting 1 hour and 50 minutes. Two of these sessions involved 1 hour of learning from certified therapy dogs. This interdisciplinary program drew expertise from veterinary mental health professionals, psychologists, animal-assisted therapists, and veterinary school faculty. This collaborative effort ensured that the program covered both the biomedical and humanistic aspects of veterinary medicine, preparing students to better understand and support their own and their peers' mental well-being. The AAE-MH program was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, and appropriate precautionary measures were taken. This teaching tip outlines the key elements of the program, including the course design, delivery, and evaluation of its effectiveness. We hope that this framework can provide fellow educators with the opportunity to potentially adapt and implement similar initiatives within their own veterinary education contexts, ultimately benefiting the entire veterinary profession.

AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the knowledge and beliefs about attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) between first-generation Chinese Canadian and European Canadian parents, and to evaluate the efficacy of an existing translated ADHD information resource to improve their ADHD literacy. A community sample of 28 first-generation Chinese Canadian and 28 European Canadian parents of elementary school-aged children completed questionnaires measuring ADHD knowledge, treatment attitudes and perceived stigma, both before and after reading an informational pamphlet about ADHD. Compared with European Canadian parents, Chinese Canadian parents initially had less knowledge and more stigma about ADHD but had greater increases in knowledge and medication acceptability after passive psychoeducation. For both groups, passive psychoeducation increased ADHD stigma, but did not impact the already high acceptability for parent training intervention. Passive psychoeducation can improve mental health literacy among ethnic minority groups, but further work needs to tailor resources to address specific gaps in mental health literacy and recognize the need for concurrent stigma-reduction methods. © The Author(s) 2025

AB  - Strength-based capacity-building interventions have the potential to enhance an individual’s capacity to improve their mental health. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to examine the effectiveness of these interventions on mental health literacy, resilience, self-efficacy, and positive thinking in adolescents without pre-existing mental/psychiatric diagnoses/conditions. CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and CNKI were searched from inception to June 2024. Two reviewers independently conducted the study screening, risk of bias assessment, and data extraction. Leave-one-out sensitivity and subgroup analyses were used to reduce the heterogeneity of the studies and their findings. Forty-seven interventional studies were included, with approaches mainly consisting of psychoeducation, individual skill training (e.g., emotional regulation, mindfulness), and supportive peer feedback. Capacity-building interventions (in 27 studies) improved the levels of mental health literacy (SMD = 1.70, 95% CI[0.57, 2.84], I2 = 97%, n = 4) and resilience (SMD = 0.51, 95% CI[0.26, 0.76], I2 = 89%, n = 16) in the short-term (< 1 month) and resilience in the long-term (> 6 months; SMD = 0.29, 95% CI[0.03, 0.55], I2 = 39%, n = 3) post-intervention. While there were limited studies evaluated on positive thinking and self-efficacy and thus unable to perform meta-analysis on these outcomes, the medium-term effects on resilience show no statistical significance (1–6 months; n = 4). However, the effects on depression and anxiety were nonsignificant. Combined approaches to capacity-building interventions that incorporate two or more theoretical frameworks/models within one intervention could enhance adolescents’ resilience (SMD = 0.24, 95% CI[0.13, 0.35], I2 = 22%, n = 3). Combining positive psychology with other mental health approaches in interventions might boost adolescents' resilience in short-term but there were limited studies and thus insufficient evidence to evaluate the medium- and long-term effectiveness of these combined approaches. Further rigorous large-scale randomized controlled trials are recommended to provide stronger evidence. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - This study, using a sample of 481 adolescents, aims to explore the relationship between ego-identity and problematic short video use in an online learning environment. The findings reveal that: (1) academic procrastination plays a significant mediating role in the relationship between ego-identity and problematic short video use; (2) both psychological resilience and academic procrastination function as a chain mediation between ego-identity and problematic short video use; and (3) there is a significant nonlinear relationship between psychological resilience and problematic short video use. This research provides a novel perspective for understanding the relationship between adolescents’ mental health and problematic behaviors. The results offer important insights for informing mental health education practices and designing effective intervention strategies. © The Author(s) 2025

AB  - Aims: This study aims to identify factors associated with mental health literacy (mental health knowledge and attitudes towards mental health and help-seeking behaviours), depression and anxiety amongst adolescents, and test the hypothesised model by examining the interrelationships between these outcomes. Design: Cross-sectional descriptive quantitative research. Methods: Using convenient sampling, 615 adolescents from four public schools completed online questionnaires measuring mental health literacy, depression, and anxiety. The data were analysed using Pearson correlation, multiple linear regression, and structural equation modelling (SEM). Results: Individual factors (e.g., gender, physical health and past traumatic experiences), family factors (e.g., parental criticism and family support) and school/community factors (e.g., academic pressure and safety) were associated with mental health outcomes. SEM revealed an association between higher mental health knowledge and better attitudes towards mental health and help-seeking behaviours but did not show a significant association with depression and anxiety. Conclusions: Findings emphasise the need for holistic and culturally safe approaches to address adolescent mental health in Indonesia. Implications: Future research should focus on developing and evaluating tailored mental health interventions in Indonesia that address individual, family, school, and community factors. These interventions should target the interrelated aspects of mental health literacy, depression, and anxiety identified in this study. Key areas for intervention include enhancing self-esteem, promoting help-seeking behaviours, supporting spirituality, managing long-term conditions, improving sleep hygiene, encouraging physical activity, teaching stress management techniques, fostering diversity, managing trauma, and combating discrimination. A comprehensive approach to adolescent mental well-being should integrate parental involvement, peer support systems, community engagement initiatives, and mental health literacy education. Impact: This research informs future interventions such as school-based programs, family-oriented campaigns, and community initiatives to support adolescent mental health, potentially influencing policy decisions, and resource allocation in mental health services. Reporting Method: STROBE guidelines. Patient or Public Contribution: No direct patient or public contribution. © 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The purpose was to assess the impact of a mobile mental health literacy training on foster parents’ perceived stress, resilience, and self-compassion. Participants (n = 142) completed a baseline and post-intervention survey including a demographic questionnaire, brief resilience scale, self-compassion scale-short, and the perceived stress scale. Participants completed the 5-hour Sharpen® Mental Health Literacy training. There was a statistically significant correlation between self-compassion and resilience (r = 0.75), as well as a significant negative relationship between perceived stress and resilience (r = -0.40) and self-compassion (r = -0.36). There was not a statistically significant difference in outcome variables pre- to post-test. Although not statistically significant, there were decreases in stress and increases in self-compassion and resilience from pre- to post-test. Key themes from open-ended responses throughout the training included goals for participating in the training, impact of stigma, stress management practices, and key training take-aways. © Associação Brasileira de Psicologia 2023.

AB  - Background: Amidst a growing shortage of human resources for mental health, concerns persist over the mental health literacy (MHL) and readiness of nursing students to fulfil their future role as non-specialist mental healthcare providers. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the MHL among nursing students enrolled in a four-year nursing programme using the Mental Health Literacy Scale (MHLS) adapted and validated for primary health care workers in the South African context. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine the factors influencing MHL among the nursing students. Results: Only a third of the 220 respondents (n = 73; 33.2%) expressed interest in specialising in mental health. A one-way ANOVA revealed statistically significant differences in the MHLS scores across year levels, F(3, 216) = 3.225, p = 0.023, though Tukey post hoc analysis found no significant difference between second-year students (with mental health theory only) and third-/fourth-years (with both theoretical and clinical exposure, p = 0.295). Year of study, family history of mental illness, and career aspirations in mental health were significant predictors of MHL. While gender initially appeared significant, a sensitivity analysis suggested that this result may not be robust due to the small number of male participants. Conclusions: The absence of a significant difference in MHL among nursing students across years of study suggests limitations in how the nursing training programme integrates mental health theory with clinical practice. Nursing education stakeholders should review curricula and teaching strategies to ensure that MHL is effectively reinforced throughout training. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Childhood and adolescent obesity is a growing public health concern in Jordan, with implications for both physical and psychological well-being. While obesity’s physical effects are well-documented, less is known about its broader association with adolescents’ quality of life (QoL), particularly in Middle Eastern contexts. This study aimed to investigate the associations between weight status, psychosocial factors, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among Jordanian adolescents. This study aimed to investigate the associations between weight status, psychosocial factors, and HRQoL among Jordanian adolescents. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 719 adolescents (63.3% female) aged 11–18, recruited from public schools and pediatric clinics in three regions of Jordan. Data were collected using validated questionnaires assessing demographics, health behaviors, mental health (PHQ-9, GAD-7, SMFQ), and HRQoL (PedsQL 4.0). Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to examine direct and indirect pathways predicting physical and psychological QoL. Results: Bullying emerged as a key mediator between weight status and QoL, particularly for physical well-being. Depression and anxiety were significant predictors of poorer psychological QoL. Positive school experience, academic performance, physical activity, and paternal education were positively associated with QoL. Nutritional habits were inversely associated with anxiety levels. Model fit indices supported the adequacy of both the physical and psychological QoL models. Conclusions: The findings highlight the interconnected relationship of weight-related stigma, school environment, and lifestyle behaviors on adolescent well-being. Multi-component, school-based interventions targeting bullying, physical activity, and mental health literacy may be effective in improving QoL in this population. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Brain Doctors is a community-engaged mental health education program developed using the Food Doctors model to enhance third-grade students’ understanding of self and community wellness. This study serves as an evaluation of the pilot program. Methods: Two dynamic, interactive 1-hour sessions were created, with pre-session and post-ses-sion assessments used to measure student growth. The sessions were presented at 2 elementary schools in Milwaukee, Wisconsin by medical students. Feedback was gathered through partici-pant satisfaction surveys following each session. Results: Student feedback indicated that most participants had a positive experience with the program. Pre-assessment (n = 116) and post-assessment (n = 125) results revealed areas of improvement and areas where performance declined. Discussion: The elementary students’ positive response demonstrated their enthusiasm for the program. This study affirmed our perception that elementary and medical students can engage meaningfully in emotional wellness education. © 2025, State Medical Society of Wisconsin. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: Social and economic conditions can have a direct impact on the prevalence and severity of mental health problems across the life course. This study explores adolescents’ insights on how poverty as a social determinant influences young people's mental health in 13 countries across the Americas, Africa, Europe and Asia. Methods: This study uses qualitative data collected through 71 focus group discussions with adolescents aged 12–19 years. In each country, focus group discussions were held separately with younger adolescents (12–15 years) and older adolescents (16–19 years) and with boys and girls. Transcripts were analyzed to identify themes related to young people's perspectives on the relationship between poverty and mental health. Results: Participants’ references to poverty and its linkages to mental health were particularly salient in low- and middle-income countries. Participants’ reflections highlighted the role of poverty as both a direct and indirect source of distress. They described intrapersonal (e.g., feeling sad for lacking necessities), interpersonal (e.g., facing stigma for being poor), as well as community and societal (e.g., having limited access to job opportunities) factors linking poverty and mental health. Discussion: Our findings highlight how adolescents perceive poverty as a fundamental determinant of their mental health, with interactions across the social environments in which they are born and develop. Interventions that improve mental health literacy, increase access to mental health services, and reduce poverty levels may improve the mental health of adolescents in resource-constrained settings. © 2025

AB  - Purpose: Adolescence is a period of developmental transition marked by a high prevalence of mental health challenges. The emergence of these challenges underscores the importance of encouraging help-seeking behaviors among adolescents to mitigate negative psychological outcomes. Gaining a deeper understanding of the lived experiences of adolescents can inform intervention development and increase access to care. Methods: This study draws on qualitative information collected from 71 focus group discussions across 13 countries with male and female adolescents aged 12–19 years old. Focus group discussions were transcribed verbatim and translated into English, with transcripts coded and analyzed for emergent themes. Focused data analysis centered on themes related to help-seeking strategies for mental health challenges as well as related barriers and facilitators. Results: Participants emphasized the critical role of informal support systems, including friends and family, in helping adolescents cope with mental health challenges. Additionally, participants highlighted the importance of accessing professional support through school or community mental health services. Significant barriers to help-seeking were described, including mental health stigma, restrictive gender norms, limited service availability, poor quality or unaffordable services, low mental health literacy, and unsupportive interpersonal relationships. Participants emphasized the role of digital technologies, school and community environments, and trustworthy relationships as facilitators of seeking help. Discussion: While many adolescents are aware of the importance of seeking help for mental health challenges, there is a need for country-level interventions to increase mental health literacy and reduce mental health stigma in order to ensure optimal access to care. © 2025

AB  - Secondary school students undergo significant psychological and physiological changes during adolescence, increasing their vulnerability to mental health issues. However, existing mental health services are inadequate to address the growing demand. To bridge this gap, we developed WarmGPT, a conversational mental health service robot utilizing a large language model integrated with cognitive- behavioral therapy, aimed at supporting secondary school students. In this study, 40 students from a Chinese secondary school were randomly assigned to an experimental group or a control group. The experimental group received 2 weeks of counseling through WarmGPT, whereas the control group viewed mental health education videos. Emotional states were evaluated before and after the intervention using scales measuring depression, anxiety, and positive and negative affect. Results indicated that the large language model-based WarmGPT significantly reduced depression, anxiety, and negative emotions and increased positive emotions among the students, outperforming the control group. These findings suggest that large language model-based conversational agents such as WarmGPT are effective in alleviating negative emotions and enhancing overall mental health in secondary school students, offering a promising new approach for mental health interventions. © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Aim/Objective: This study aims to explore and evaluate postgraduate student experiences of a perinatal mental health education programme and to explore the value of collaborative learning within an interprofessional group. Background: Evidence highlights the need for accessible mental health care during the perinatal period from educated and skilled healthcare professionals. Until recently, there has been a lack of emphasis on perinatal mental health care provision and a subsequent lack of education and training in the area for healthcare professionals. Design: A qualitative descriptive research study was conducted to evaluate an interprofessional approach to perinatal mental health education. Participants: A purposive sample of postgraduate healthcare professionals (n = 10) who completed the first year of the Master of Science in Perinatal Mental Health programme or who had completed relevant standalone modules, at a Higher Education Institute in Ireland, participated in the study. Methods: Data collection were conducted via four online small-group discussions and thematic analysis was utilised to analyse the narrative data. Results: Three themes illustrate participants’ experiences of the perinatal mental health programme: Learning with other professionals, Enhanced confidence for clinical practice and Challenges of the programme. Conclusion: By undertaking the perinatal mental health programme/modules participants were provided with opportunities to engage in interprofessional education. The programme offered opportunities for developing networking relationships which continued into clinical practice. Participants acknowledged the benefits of the programme in acquiring specialist knowledge and skills regarding the spectrum of perinatal mental health enhancing clinical assessment, communication, and confidence in care provision. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - Background: Millions of children and youth are forcibly displaced due to conflict and socio-economic hardship. Refugee minors face heightened mental health risks yet consistently underutilize services. This disparity reflects a complex interaction of individual, developmental, systemic, and societal barriers. This review synthesizes evidence on factors affecting refugee children's and youths’ access to mental health care to inform policy and practice. Methods: An overview of reviews was conducted with a narrative synthesis of eligible studies. Findings were organized using Levesque et al.’s (2013) five-stage access model: perceiving needs, seeking care, reaching services, using services, and achieving outcomes. Barriers were examined at each stage, considering both servicerelated and population-level factors. Results: Barriers emerged at every stage. Services often lacked cultural and linguistic sensitivity, early screening, and flexible delivery, while systems were fragmented and unaffordable. Interventions rarely addressed the specific needs of refugee minors or promoted sustained engagement. Refugee children and youth faced low mental health literacy, stigma, limited autonomy, legal insecurity, unstable housing, and weak family or community support. Unaccompanied minors and those in detention were especially vulnerable. Gender-specific constraints—such as restricted mobility, caregiving burdens, and exposure to gender-based violence—further limited refugee girls’ access. Conclusions: Equitable access requires integrated, culturally responsive, and traumainformed reforms across all stages of care. Key priorities include stigma reduction, expanded community-based services, low-threshold care, and family-inclusive models. Sustained policy commitment and cross-sector collaboration are essential to support this vulnerable population. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - Background: Preparation support—defined as structured, age-appropriate educational and psychological interventions to familiarize patients with upcoming procedures—is important for emotionally vulnerable children undergoing heart surgery. Objectives: This pilot study evaluated a preparation program for pediatric cardiac surgery patients and identified effective components for psychological support. Methods: Six patients (aged 5–16 years) undergoing cardiac surgery and their parents participated in our preparation program, which included role-play with medical equipment, age-appropriate videos demonstrating perioperative flow and sensory information, and coping strategy instruction. Data were collected through perioperative observations, post-discharge interviews with children, and parental questionnaires, then analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Results: Preparatory counseling improved illness acceptance, treatment motivation, and self-coping skills during the perioperative period. Children demonstrated positive emotional and cooperative responses during hospitalization, with qualitative analysis revealing two main categories of children's experiences: 1) understanding of treatment and sense of accomplishment, and 2) fluctuating anxiety and stress. Parental responses similarly formed two categories: concerns about communication and expectations for healthcare collaboration. Some children initially experienced increased fear that typically resolved over time. Conclusion: Preparation counseling effectively supports pediatric cardiac surgery patients psychologically while helping parents provide appropriate emotional support. The mixed emotional responses observed highlight the need for ongoing program refinement. Enhanced preparation programs specifically designed for children with congenital heart disease can reduce psychological distress during extended hospitalizations and improve overall well-being in this vulnerable population. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In recent years, the increasing prevalence of mental health issues among higher education students has posed significant challenges for higher education institutions in managing these concerns. To address these challenges, artificial intelligence (AI) has been utilized in this field. To comprehensively understand the application of AI in mental health management for higher education students, we conducted a systematic review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology. The results indicate that the applications of AI in mental health management for higher education students primarily focus on four areas: mental health assessment, education, prediction, and intervention. These areas have exhibited significant effectiveness, leading to notable improvements in providing more objective, efficient, and accurate assessment and prediction results. Furthermore, they have contributed to enhancing the mental health education environment and strategies, thereby improving educational efficiency and offering personalized services. Additionally, they have augmented overall effectiveness and enabled more timely, cost-effective, and accessible interventions. In conclusion, the application of AI has demonstrated considerable potential in addressing the various challenges associated with mental health management for students in higher education. © 2025 The Authors.

AB  - Rationale: Mental health literacy enables adolescents to acquire information that will accompany them in their future lives and to define their attitudes and behaviors. Aims and Objectives: This study evaluated the Turkish validity and reliability of the Universal Mental Health Literacy Scale for Adolescents (10–14 years). Methods: This is a methodological, correlational, cross-sectional, and descriptive study. The study was conducted with 223 adolescents. Data were collected by ‘Information Form’ and ‘Universal Mental Health Literacy Scale for Adolescents.’ Exploratory Factor Analysis, Confirmatory Factor Analysis, and Pearson Correlation analysis were used to assess the validity and reliability of the UMHL-A. Results: Item Content Validity Index (I-CVI) scores ranged from 0.94 to 0.96, while the Scale Content Validity Index (S-CVI) was 0.95. For ‘Help-seeking and Stigma dimensions’ χ2/df = 3.347, NFI = 0.804, IFI = 0.854, TLI = 0.778, CFI = 0.849, RMSEA = 0.103. For ‘Knowledge of Mental Health and Knowledge of Mental Illnesses dimensions’ χ2/df = 1.959, NFI = 0.731, IFI = 0.847, TLI = 0.774, CFI = 0.837, RMSEA = 0.066. The internal consistency and time stability were affirmed by a Hotelling T-square value of 15.241 and an F-test result of 27.793. Conclusions: This study reveals that the Turkish validity and reliability of the Universal Mental Health Literacy Scale for Adolescents is a valid and reliable tool for assessing mental health literacy among adolescents. The UMHL-A scale is a valid tool to evaluate critical aspects of mental health literacy in adolescent populations and can be used in both research and clinical practice in mental health education and intervention. It is recommended that the Turkish version of the Universal Mental Health Literacy Scale should be used to determine resilience in adolescents. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Mental health conditions affect many young people in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where stigma is high and access to care is limited. Digital tools accessible on basic mobile phones offer a scalable way to promote mental health, but evidence on their effectiveness in SSA is limited. This study evaluated the reach, feasibility, acceptability, and knowledge outcomes of Digital MindSKILLZ, an interactive voice response (IVR) mental health intervention implemented in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Nigeria, Rwanda, Uganda, and Zambia. Over seven months, 700,138 people called the platform, and 425,395 (61%) listened to at least one message. Of these users, 63.6% were under 25 and 68.3% were from rural areas. The three content branches—mental health information, mental health skills, and soccer quizzes—were accessed by 36.5%, 46.4%, and 50.9% of users, respectively. Among users who accessed the mental health branch of the intervention, the mean number of messages completed was 7.6 out of 18 messages. In a follow-up survey, 91% of users understood the content, 85% would recommend the intervention, and 38% found the mental health content most helpful. Average knowledge scores were 62%, with lower scores on common disorders and stigma. The intervention showed strong reach and acceptability, but content and implementation improvements are needed to boost engagement and retention. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Mental illness, often linked to ignorance and superstitions, significantly impacts women’s mental health, particularly during pregnancy-marked by significant physical, emotional, and psychological changes. Prenatal mental health screening face challenges like stigma and lack of standardized protocols, while family support is essential reducing stress and enhancing well-being. Aim: To assess knowledge, attitude and help seeking behaviors towards mental ailments among pregnant women and their families visiting primary health centers (PHCs). Methods: A cross-sectional study conducted at a PHC during antenatal checkup days over 1 month recruiting pregnant women and their family members aged ≥18 years. A total of 230 participants were recruited. Data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire and validated scales: Mental Health Knowledge Schedule (MAKS), Community Attitudes towards Mental Illness (CAMI-12 item) and Mental Help Seeking Attitudes Scale (MHSAS). Descriptive statistics, Chi-square test, Student’s t-test, one-way ANOVA, Pearson correlation, and linear regression were used. A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Most participants lacked awareness of mental illness during pregnancy and childbirth. Higher education levels among participants correlated with better mental health knowledge. Participants with greater knowledge and positive attitudes demonstrated increased help-seeking behaviors. Positive correlations were observed between mental health knowledge, favorable attitudes, and help-seeking behaviors. Conclusion: Poor knowledge and unfavorable attitude toward mental illness impact help seeking behaviour, among pregnant women and their families, compromising maternal and child health. Intervention to enhance knowledge, and promoting perinatal mental health services are essential to address these gaps. © 2025 Indian Journal of Psychiatry.

AB  - This study examined the current state of mental health literacy (MHL)-related educator training, certification, and policy in Nova Scotia, Canada. It addressed three research questions: (i) How has Nova Scotia's educational policy landscape responded to the Evergreen Framework's (EF's) strategic directions? (ii) What are the strengths and gaps in current MHL-related policies? (iii) What sources of MHL training are available to preservice educators through Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.) and early childhood education (ECE) programs and to in-service educators through Master of Education (M.Ed.) programs and professional development (PD). A deductive content analysis was used to evaluate the alignment of provincial policies with the EF. An environmental scan and systematic analysis were conducted across ECE, B.Ed., and M.Ed. programs, as well as PD offerings and curriculum content. Findings indicate that while aspects of MHL are embedded within inclusive education policies and select course offerings, explicit training in MHL is limited and inconsistently implemented. PD opportunities and regional education center resources vary widely, and MHL competencies are not mandated for certification. The study provides recommendations for policy and training reform. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Objectives: This study examines the relationship between mental health literacy and the patient-mental health provider relationships, particularly American Indian/Alaska Native/Native American (AI/AN) patients’ access to, trust in, and utilization of mental health professionals and their services. Study design: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey to collect data on mental health literacy and its impact on AI/AN patients' trust and interactions with their mental health providers. Methods: A total of 563 AI/AN adult patients completed the survey, which was disseminated using snowball sampling. We assessed mental health literacy using a multi-component measure and performed linear regressions to examine its associations with key factors including socio-demographic characteristics, mental health care access, trusting in mental health providers/specialists, the frequency of using mental health services, trusting in mental health providers/specialists for general health information and for COVID-19 information, as well as their level of satisfaction with the services received from mental health providers/specialists. Results: We identified mental health literacy as a major factor associated with patient-mental health provider relationships among AI/AN patients. Patients reporting lower levels of mental health literacy were likely to report having no regular access to mental health care, lower levels of trust in mental health providers/specialists, less satisfaction with the services received from mental health providers/specialists, and less trust in mental health specialists for COVID-19 information. Conclusions: Mental health literacy is a key factor influencing the patient-mental health provider relationships among AI/AN patients. Interventions to enhance mental health literacy may improve trust and satisfaction with mental health services in this population. © 2025 The Royal Society for Public Health

AB  - Syrian refugees in Türkiye show a high prevalence of mental health problems but encounter barriers to accessing mental health services. Group Problem Management Plus (gPM+), developed by the World Health Organization, is a low-intensity psychological intervention delivered by nonspecialist facilitators. This qualitative process evaluation explores the acceptability, feasibility and perceived effectiveness of gPM+ for Syrian refugees resettled in Türkiye, as well as facilitating factors and barriers to its implementation. Twenty-three semi-structured interviews were conducted with gPM+ participants, facilitators, drop-outs, relatives of participants and key informants. Findings showed that gPM+ was well-received for its group-based format, which participants felt fostered social support, and for its content, which they reported may have led to improvements in coping skills and family relationships. Facilitators viewed the intervention as feasible to implement. However, barriers such as participants’ economic struggles, practical challenges (e.g., childcare and transportation difficulties) and low mental health literacy impeded engagement. Adapting gPM+ to address social determinants like poverty may be beneficial. The need for booster sessions was emphasized to maintain long-term change and provide deeper learning of the strategies. For sustainable scaling up gPM+ within primary health care, key informants highlighted the importance of training and supervising nonprofessional facilitators and securing governmental support. © The Author(s), 2025.

AB  - Introduction: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) cause 71% of global deaths, with many risk factors originating in childhood. Understanding adolescent health knowledge and behaviors across countries is essential for targeted public health interventions. This study compares health literacy, dietary habits, physical activity, mental health awareness, sexual health education, and substance use awareness between adolescents in India and the United States (US). Design and methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 200 adolescents (100 per country) recruited through educational institutions and online platforms. Stratified sampling ensured representation across age (13–18 years), gender, and geographic location (urban vs rural). A structured questionnaire, adapted from validated instruments, assessed health-related behaviors and knowledge. Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests compared responses, and logistic regression adjusted for confounders. Results: Significant differences emerged between Indian and US adolescents. Indian respondents had lower mental health awareness (46% vs 88%, p = 0.0004) and Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) prevention knowledge (58% vs 77%, p < 0.0001). Regular physical activity was higher in the US (50% vs 20%, p < 0.0001), as was nutrition awareness (83% vs 69%, p = 0.0152). Indian adolescents more often relied on school-based health education (29% vs 21%) and social media (30% vs 29%) for information. Conclusion: Findings highlight disparities in adolescent health literacy and behaviors across India and the US. Public health efforts should prioritize mental health literacy, nutrition education, and physical activity, especially in India. Digital platforms and school-based initiatives can help bridge knowledge gaps and promote healthier adolescent behaviors globally. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Background Recent reports point to a global and Swedish national mental health crisis among young adults. It is widely recognised that this phase of ‘emerging adulthood’ involves many challenges, stressors and uncertainties that can negatively impact mental health and well-being. In addition, these strains may be exacerbated by rapid contemporary changes in technological, societal and sociocultural contexts. Developing and tailoring interventions bolstering the mental well-being of young adults requires deeper insights into their lived experiences, self-perceived strengths and challenges. Aim This paper has two interconnected purposes: Firstly, presenting relevant theories and theoretical perspectives at the individual, group and societal levels providing a rationale for theorised study propositions underpinning a situational analysis of Swedish young adults. Secondly, building on this theoretical foundation, the aim is to describe a protocol for a case study and situational analysis examining how Swedish young adults from Generation Z experience their transition to adulthood, its impacts on their mental health, describing their mental health literacy, occupational balance, and support needs. Method This case study protocol outlines a holistic, single-case study design employing a flexible approach. Data will be collected in Sweden through focus groups and individual interviews with stakeholders, young adults, and their parents. Existing and available mental health and well-being promotion in Sweden will be mapped through online searches. The various data sources will initially be analysed separately using thematic analysis. Subsequently the subthemes and themes will be jointly analysed across participant groups using pattern matching in workshop formats. Conclusions The results of this case-study are expected to generate new knowledge of the reasons underpinning the increase in mental ill-health among young adults in Sweden. This knowledge will subsequently inform the future co-production and core design features of a digital mental e-health intervention aimed at promoting mental well-being among Swedish young adults aged 18–29. © 2025 Karaba Bäckström et al.

AB  - In the literature, it is suggested that curriculum programs should be updated, sufficient content should be added to the psychiatric and mental health nursing course, and training programs should be organized to improve students' mental health literacy. This study aimed to determine the effect of the psychiatric and mental health nursing course on mental health literacy among nursing students. This study was conducted as a quasi-experimental study with 69 nursing students. The mean age of the students was 21.97±1.14 and 79.7% were female. It was found that the posttest mean scores of the mental health literacy scale and its sub-scales were significantly higher than the pretest mean scores. It is recommended to add sufficient content to the psychiatric and mental health nursing course and support it with clinical practice. In places where there are no units on mental health for the implementation of the course, consultation-liaison psychiatric nursing practice enables students to put the information they receive in the course into practice and increases the mental health literacy level. © 2025, Inonu University.

AB  - Suicide and self-harm are a leading cause of death globally, with females aged 15–24 years being a high-risk group requiring urgent intervention. Promoting mental health literacy is a well-established strategy for early intervention. No review has explored the available interventions promoting mental health literacy for female adolescents and their reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance as a whole remains unknown. This study reviews existing interventions promoting mental health literacy in female adolescents. Searches included original peer-reviewed articles from inception to May 2024 across six databases, identifying twelve studies for review. Five independent meta-analyses were conducted, showing no significant effects immediately post-intervention for mental health literacy, knowledge, stigmatising attitudes, and help-provision. A significant reduction in stigmatising attitudes was found > 6 months post-intervention. Moderation analyses could not be performed due to insufficient data. None of the included studies reported on interventions specifically for female adolescents. This review also evaluated reporting of RE-AIM components, finding limited reporting on reach, adoption, and maintenance. These findings highlight a substantial gap in high-impact and tailored mental health prevention and promotion interventions for female adolescents. Therefore, there is a clear need to understand and target female adolescents’ mental health literacy needs to develop and implement more effective interventions. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Advocates 4 ALL Youth (ALLY) is a universal, 6-week mental health literacy program, implemented in schools during the school day by community volunteers. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of the ALLY program on youth who endorsed negative affect (i.e., self-reported symptoms of both depression and anxiety). Using a randomized controlled trial design, 5–6th grade students (11–13 years) attending three rural elementary schools in low-income and predominant African American communities were invited to participate. A total of 109 students (91% African American/Black) participated in the program (91% participation rate) and were randomized into treatment group—who received ALLY (n = 57) or control group (n = 52). All students completed a pre–post-assessment (baseline and post-program). A total of 58% youth in the treatment group endorsed negative affect at baseline and this was reduced to 53% post-program delivery (p < 0.01). No change in negative affect was reported in control group (44% pre and 44% post with self-reported negative affect). These results suggest that participants at greatest risk for mental health issues may benefit from ALLY. © 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - There is evidence that Asian migrants in Australia may be relatively reluctant to seek professional help for depression. Reluctance may be related to poor mental health literacy, including limited knowledge of help-seeking options and treatments, and a preference to seek help from informal networks. This study investigated Sri Lankan Australians’ knowledge about managing depression by examining their hypothetical help-seeking intentions and perceptions about interventions and help-providers’ helpfulness. Following Jorm's mental health literacy framework, participants (N = 374) were presented with a vignette of a Sri Lankan Australian exhibiting symptomatology consistent with Major Depressive Disorder, and asked to indicate their intentions to seek help by responding to the question: “If you had Mr Silva's problem, what would you do?”. Participants also rated the likely helpfulness of various professional and informal helpers and interventions in addressing a problem akin to Mr Silva’s. Participants reported being likely to seek help from GPs (35.8%), psychologists (25.7%) and friends (24.3%). Additionally, those who intended to seek informal help were significantly less likely to seek professional help, and vice versa. Furthermore, psychologists (94.1%), counsellors (93.3%), close friends (92.5%) and compatriots (91.4%) were most frequently categorised as helpful. Given participants’ high endorsement of psychiatric treatment, psychological treatment, and self-help strategies such as engaging in enjoyable activities, it would be helpful for clinicians to emphasise the benefits of these interventions for managing depression. Additionally, recognising some participants’ inclination towards religious practices and helpers, clinicians can consider integrating these help-seeking behaviours into therapeutic approaches. Future research is warranted to examine the predictors of help-seeking intentions. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Objective: This narrative literature review aims to explore the current landscape regarding the management of patient mental health disclosures and gaps in resources and protocols within Canadian dental and dental hygiene programs. Methods: CINAHL and Education Source databases, and the Journal of Dental Education were used to search for literature published between 2001 and 2023. Results: A total of 54 sources were included, primarily comprising original research articles, systematic and other literature reviews. Discussion: The prevalence of mental health disclosures is rising, with 1 in 5 Canadians living with a mental health condition. Current dental and dental hygiene programs lack explicit protocols for managing patient mental health disclosures, and the literature reveals a scarcity of research on students’ preparedness. This review underscores the importance of adopting humanistic language to reduce stigma and emphasizes educational institutions’ roles in evaluating and facilitating mental health services to support the mental health lived experiences of dental and dental hygiene patients. Conclusion: The review identifies 3 key research gaps: the absence of qualitative research on the student experience of managing patient disclosures, unclear integration of mental health education, and a scarcity of comprehensive evaluations of mental health services. Recommendations include incorporating mental health training in entry-to-practice curricula, aligning with established community support frameworks, and creating dedicated resources for the effective management of mental health disclosures for patients in educational settings. ©2025 Canadian Dental Hygienists Association.

AB  - Background: Mobile applications offer promising tools to promote mental health awareness and engagement, but their effectiveness in fostering help-seeking behaviour, particularly in Indonesia, remains underexplored. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a mobile application in enhancing help-seeking behaviour among adolescents in Bandung, Indonesia. Methods: A quasi-experimental pre-and post-test control group design was employed. A total of 200 adolescents aged 15–18 years were divided into intervention (n = 100) and control (n = 100) groups. The intervention group utilised a mental health mobile App with interactive health education and reminders systems for eight weeks, while the control group received mental health education pamphlets. Help-seeking behaviour was assessed using the Help-Seeking Behaviour Questionnaire (HSBQ) pre-and post-intervention. Regression analysis controlled for baseline scores and demographics. Results: The intervention group demonstrated significant improvements in help-seeking behaviour compared to the control group (B = 2.10, p < 0.001), independent of baseline scores. Conclusion: The findings highlight the potential of mobile applications to enhance help-seeking behaviour among adolescents, addressing critical barriers such as stigma and lack of awareness. Further research is needed to evaluate long-term sustainability and scalability on diverse populations. © 2025, Asia Pacific Higher Learning Sdn Bhd., Lincoln University College. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: To explore barriers to seeking mental health services among young people in Chennai, South India, using a qualitative study. Methods: Young people aged 18 to 24 years with a diagnosis of any mental disorder were purposively recruited from a tertiary mental health centre in Chennai, South India, between April 2022 and March 2023. Face-to-face in-depth interviews were conducted. Questions pertaining to barriers to help-seeking included personal and emotional, social and cultural, environmental, and financial barriers. Each interview was audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim or translated into English. Thematic analysis was performed. Results: In total, eight male and seven female participants (mean age 21.2 years) were included in the analysis. Five major themes emerged: (1) stigma and discrimination (including feelings of isolation and neglect, societal labelling, and reduced employment opportunities due to mental illness), (2) religious and spiritual factors (characterised by ignorance and high levels of stigma), (3) mental health literacy (poor understanding of mental health), (4) logistical barriers (limited access to healthcare facilities and transportation difficulties), and (5) financial barriers (high treatment costs and difficulties accessing government medical schemes). Conclusion: Young people with mental disorders in India face multiple barriers to accessing mental health services. These findings may inform researchers, clinicians, and policymakers in developing targeted interventions, strategic frameworks, and policy reforms to promote early help-seeking among this population. © 2025 Hong Kong College of Psychiatrists.

AB  - This study investigates the effects of embodied (breathing exercises) and cognitive interventions on adolescents’ flow experience and cognition patterns. Using a mixed-methods design, 303 vocational high school students were assigned to three groups: Embodied Task Group (N = 108), Cognitive Task Group (N = 100), and Mental Health Course Group (N = 95). Experiment 1 employed a 3×2 Multivariate Analysis of Covariance (MANCOVA) design to compare flow experience dimensions, while Experiment 2 used Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA) to analyze diary entries. Results showed that the Embodied Task Group outperformed the Cognitive Task Group in “Unambiguous Feedback” (η<inf>p</inf>2 = 0.01, a small effect) and had higher “Transformation of Time” (η<inf>p</inf>2 = 0.01, a small effect) than the Mental Health Course Group. ENA revealed that the Embodied Group developed stronger body-environment interaction patterns, shifting cognition pattern from psychological evaluations to dynamic bodily processes over time. Conversely, the Cognitive Task Group maintained event-focused cognition with weaker mind–body integration. Findings highlight breathing exercises’ potential to enhance flow experience through embodied awareness and multisensory processing, offering practical implications for mental health education by promoting embodied learning tasks to foster flow experience. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: This study evaluated a school-based mental health program within a psychiatry clerkship to enhance medical students’ competencies in mental health literacy, empathy, communication, and adaptability. The program aimed to bridge theoretical knowledge with practical skills through experiential learning in a real-world, community-based setting. Methods: The study utilized convenience sampling to select 32 medical students from the 2023-2024 psychiatry clerkship cohort. Four focus group discussions, each lasting 60-90 minutes, provided qualitative data, which were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis in Atlas.ti (ATLAS.ti GmbH, Germany) to identify themes related to professional development. Results: Five key themes emerged, highlighting significant gains in context-sensitive communication, empathy, and mental health literacy specific to adolescent issues. The students reported increased clinical confidence, enhanced resilience through psychological techniques such mindfulness and motivational interviewing, and benefited from sustained engagement and peer support, fostering collaboration and stress management. Conclusion: The school-based mental health program enhanced essential competencies in mental health literacy, empathy, communication, and practical skills for medical students. By integrating experiential learning into medical education, the program addressed training gaps, equipping future healthcare providers with the skills necessary for holistic and patient-centered mental healthcare across diverse clinical settings. The approach showed potential for broader applications in medical education to prepare students for comprehensive mental health support skills. © The Korean Society of Medical Education.

AB  - Mental health literacy is crucial for nursing students to deliver effective patient care; however, its development throughout their academic journey remains underexplored. This study aimed to assess mental health literacy among nursing students in the UAE and examine factors influencing their literacy levels. A quantitative cross-sectional study was conducted from February 2024 to August 2024 using convenience sampling. A total of 295 undergraduate nursing students participated in the study. Data were collected using the Mental Health Literacy Questionnaire (MHLq) and analyzed using SPSS software (version 24). Descriptive and inferential analyses were conducted to calculate means, standard deviations, percentages, and measures of association using t-tests for students’ sociodemographic variables, dimensions, and global scores, with a significance level of 0.05 for the tests. The findings indicated that participants (all female, with a mean age of 20.7 ± 1.85 years) had a mean MHLq score of 108.19 ± 10.53. Fourth-year students scored higher (110.78 ± 9.79) than lower-year students (106.85 ± 10.68). Students with family or friends who were affected had higher scores (48.00 ± 6.16) than those without (45.97 ± 6.16). The highest-scoring domain was knowledge of mental health problems (46.59 ± 6.40), while self-help strategies scored lowest (16.99 ± 2.61). Students with a personal history of mental illness had lower scores. The study also indicated a statistically significant association between students’ marital status, their level of study, and their first-aid skills and help-seeking behavior. The study highlights the importance of integrating mental health literacy into undergraduate nursing curricula to enhance student’s ability to provide patient-centered care for individuals with mental health disorders. Implementing targeted educational strategies focusing on awareness, recognition, and communication may strengthen students’ competency and preparedness for mental health care practice. © 2025 AlMekkawi et al.

AB  - Mindfulness has been widely shown to enhance attention, yet its effects on different attentional functions and the required intervention duration remain inconsistent. Precise findings regarding attentional improvements can inform targeted interventions for specific ADHD subtypes. This study investigated the temporal progression of improvements in attentional functions during mindfulness interventions using a longitudinal design. A total of 116 participants were randomly assigned to three groups: mindfulness meditation (n = 39), music relaxation (n = 39), and mental health education (n = 38). Ultimately, 90 participants (30 per group) completed the study. Baseline data were collected through demographic questionnaires, the Toronto Mindfulness Scale (TMS), a psychological distress questionnaire, and the Attention Network Test (ANT). During the five-week intervention, participants practiced their assigned activities for 10 min daily (excluding weekends) and completed state mindfulness assessments and ANT testing at weeks 1, 3, and 5. After controlling for baseline measures, no significant linear increase in state mindfulness was found across the groups. However, the mindfulness group demonstrated significant and sustained improvements in executive control from the first week onward, outperforming the control groups. In contrast, no significant changes were observed in alerting or orienting functions throughout the intervention. These findings suggest that mindfulness primarily enhances executive control, while its effects on alerting and orienting functions remain unclear and warrant further investigation. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.

AB  - In recent years, there has been a notable increase in the prevalence of deliberate self-harm (DSH) among adolescents, which has led to the recognition of this issue as a significant public health challenge. However, school-based prevention programmes for DSH remain scarce. This study aimed to develop, implement, and evaluate the effectiveness of the Healthy Minds programme, a universal school-based prevention intervention targeting DSH in adolescents. Conducted in a Lisbon school, the programme sought to reduce DSH and suicidal ideation, change beliefs about DSH, and promote help-seeking. A quasi-experimental design with experimental and control groups included 137 participants aged 13–19 (M = 14.73; SD = 1.03), assessed at three time points: pre-intervention, post-intervention, and follow-up. The intervention showed partial effectiveness, with delayed reductions in DSH and significant improvements in reducing false beliefs. In addition, both groups showed increased help-seeking behaviours, and these effects were sustained over the follow-up period, suggesting long-term effectiveness. However, no significant improvements were observed in the ability to recognise warning signs of DSH, nor were there reductions in levels of suicidal ideation. The Healthy Minds programme shows promise in reducing DSH, improving mental health literacy and promoting help-seeking behaviours in adolescents, with sustained benefits observed over time. These findings highlight the importance of implementing well-structured, methodologically robust school-based interventions aimed at preventing DSH in this population. To maximise programme effectiveness, longer follow-up periods and more integrated, multifaceted approaches are essential. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.

AB  - Evidence-based stigma reduction interventions for student-athletes exist, but researchers have focused on assessing their effectiveness with little attention paid to understanding how participants experience such programs. The current study aimed to qualitatively evaluate a mental illness destigmatization intervention delivered to 35 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I studentathletes. The program consisted of four weekly 1 hr empirically based sessions. Program-level results showed that participants increased their understanding of student-athlete mental health and identified actionable ways to combat stigma. Session-level results revealed intervention components impacted knowledge and application consistent with their theoretical underpinnings (i.e., mental health literacy). Practical guidelines based on the findings suggest stigma reduction interventions aimed at student-athletes should provide information specific to the athletic context (i.e., common symptoms experienced by athletes), consider content that moves beyond mental health literacy (e.g., contact-based interventions), and present opportunities for participants to apply what they have learned (i.e., roll play displaying empathy). © 2025 Human Kinetics, Inc.

AB  - Background: A key component of the Live4Life program, run by not-for-profit entity Youth Live4Life, is a ‘Crew’ of youth mental health ambassadors aged 14–16 years who undergo a mental health education, leadership, and advocacy program. Building on past evaluations, this study explores the impacts of Live4LifeCrew participation on their lives after leaving secondary school. Objective: This study describes the impacts of Crew participation on alumni's health, wellbeing, education, employment, and skill development after leaving secondary school, and to explore the drivers of these impacts. Methods: Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with Crew alumni (n = 16, 67 % female) in Victoria, Australia. Template analysis was used to analyse the data, using the Bronfenbrenner's Process-Person-Context-Time (PPCT) as an organising framework. Results: Crew participation enhanced interpersonal skills such as leadership, communication, public speaking, and empathy that alumni continued to use in their study, work, and relationships. Participants reported maintenance of key Mental Health First Aid skills, including knowledge of mental health problems and confidence to help others experiencing a mental health crisis. Their own help-seeking behaviours improved during and after Crew participation. Effective adult support was vital in shaping participant experiences; however, when such support did not consider the school or community context, it negatively impacted Crew members' experiences. Crew alumni characterised the Live4Life model as unique in a context with high stigma around mental health challenges and limited mental health education. Conclusions: Alumni described the Live4Life Crew program as an impactful and positive experience. Participants noted the importance of tailoring implementation to specific settings to further enhance the program's impact. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - Objective: Children in the Juvenile Justice System (JJS) face multiple adversities that may predispose them to developing mental health (MH) problems. Interventions that enhance the MH and well-being of these children while providing access to appropriate MH care are needed. This study examines the effect of a multipronged, low-intensity intervention on adolescents' well-being, stress levels, MH knowledge, and stigma perceptions in Childcare Institutions (CCIs) across Odisha and Tamil Nadu, India. Methods: Implemented in 7 CCIs, the intervention aimed to enhance the MH Literacy (MHL) and well-being of children in the CCIs through the Youth-Friendly Spaces (YFS) using experiential methods. It also sought to improve the MHL of the staff and administration within the JJS and provide access to MH care by linking CCIs to available local resources. Information using validated scales was obtained at baseline and six months. Results: Only 180 of the 310 children for whom baseline data was available remained in the CCI at six months. A statistically significant improvement in well-being (34.5 +13.7–55.9 +12.2, p < 0.001), stress (18.5 +6.8–17 +6.1, p = 0.044) and stigma (32 +11.9–29.4 +11.4, p = 0.023) scores were observed. Adjusted linear regression analysis showed significant differences across genders, sites, and child types. Discussion: This intervention, comprising YFS creation, MHL enhancement, and referral system development, is significantly associated with improved well-being of children in CCIs. The results underscore the need for tailored interventions based on gender, location, and child type. The study highlights the potential scalability of such programs in resource-constrained settings for vulnerable children. © 2025

AB  - Although often portrayed as “model minorities,” many Asian American adolescents struggle with mental health problems. Asian American youth are also less likely to receive school-based mental health services (SBMHS) compared with their non-Asian peers. Culturally adapting the Youth Mental Health Fist Aid (YMHFA) training program can be an effective way to engage Asian American parents to utilize SBMHS. Although many school districts have offered YMHFA trainings to staff and parents, no controlled studies have evaluated the efficacy of YMHFA in the United States. We culturally adapted YMHFA for Asian American parents through collaboration with schools and community organizations, and evaluated its efficacy using a blocked random assignment study design. We examined if (a) YMHFA impacted parents' mental health literacy (MHL), help-seeking intentions, stigma, attitudes towards professional help, confidence in MHFA skills, engagement in first-aid behaviors, and youth mental health (both parent and youth report); and (b) whether the improvement was maintained four months after the training. Parents (n = 99, M<inf>age</inf> = 46.24; SD<inf>age</inf> = 6.80, 89 % mothers) were randomly assigned to treatment and waitlist control groups. They completed measures before the intervention, one month after the intervention, and four months after the intervention. Parents in the experimental group showed decreased stigma, and improvements in MHL, attitudes towards help seeking, confidence in using first aid behavior, and actual engagement in first aid behavior after attending the training as compared to parents in the waitlist control group. Participants in waitlist control group also showed improvements in all above-mentioned areas after receiving the training. All treatment gains were maintained at 4-month follow-up. Findings contributed to the limited literature on how to culturally adapt YMHFA for Asian American parents at school, and provided evidence for the efficacy of YMHFA among Asian American parents. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - Introduction. Mental health disorders are increasingly common in adolescence, and peer stigma represents a significant barrier. Defining this construct is essential for its evaluation, prevention, and intervention. The aim of this study was to conceptualize mental disorder stigma in adolescents. Method. A scoping review was conducted in the Web of Science, Scopus, Eric, PubMed, and PsycInfo databases (2011-2021), using descriptors in both English and Spanish. A total of 11,144 articles were retrieved; 51 were selected after screening, and six additional articles were included through other methods. Results. Social stigma in adolescents is described as negative beliefs that may lead to rejection and discriminatory behavior. Different types were identified (public stigma, self-stigma, structural stigma, and associative stigma). Stigma is considered a multidimensional construct (cognitive, emotional, and behavioral dimensions) and is influenced by variables such as sex, nationality, educational level, age, socioeconomic status, personal experience, mental health literacy, and help-seeking behavior. Discussion. Most studies are grounded in the theoretical contributions of Goffman and Corrigan. Recent literature highlights the urgent need to develop effective, sustainable, and culturally adapted prevention programs. The lack of consensus on conceptual and methodological frameworks hinders comparison across studies, reinforcing the importance of valid instruments tailored to adolescents. Identifying factors that influence stigma is essential to guide more inclusive educational interventions. © 2025. Psy, Soc & Educ.

AB  - Introduction: Health literacy is a critical element in determining individuals' health outcomes and plays a crucial role in promoting health. Mental health literacy is an integral component of health literacy. Individuals from minority groups, such as Indigenous Communities, tend to have lower levels of mental health literacy, leading to poorer mental health outcomes. This research aims to examine the correlation between mental health literacy and brief behavioural among indigenous adolescent girls. Materials and methods: The study utilized a cross-sectional design and included a sample of 59 indigenous adolescent girls from Kampung Adat Cirendeu, Cimahi City. The sample selection criteria specifically targeted adolescent girls aged 10-19 years. The Mental Health Knowledge Questionnaire (MHKQ) was used to assess mental health literacy, while the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was used to evaluate brief behavioural levels. The chi square test was used to analyze the data in this study. Results: The research findings revealed that a majority of respondents had low mental health literacy, and most of them had abnormal levels of brief behavioural issues. Furthermore, the study found a significant correlation between mental health literacy and brief behavioural levels among indigenous adolescent girls, with a p-value of 0.004. Conclusion: These findings emphasize the importance of interventions aimed at addressing mental health literacy, which can significantly impact behavioural health outcomes for adolescents. © 2025 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.

AB  - Introduction: Perinatal depression occurs in 10-15% of women. One of the causes is a lack of knowledge about the process of pregnancy until the postpartum period which results in birth complications and disrupts the baby’s growth and development. Objective: This study aims to determine the effectiveness of health education on perinatal depression. Methods: This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement guidelines. A literature search was conducted through four electronic databases: ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, PubMed, and SAGE with inclusion criteria: maternal respondents with perinatal depression, original articles, controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-experimental methodology, published 2017 to 2023, in English, full text and intervention in the form of education. Results: The initial search was 2216 articles and after removing duplicate articles there were 62 articles, and 10 articles met the inclusion criteria and entered the analysis stage. The educational material is almost identical, including preparation for childbirth, care for pregnant women, postpartum mothers, baby care, and maternal mental health. Education methods mostly use digital or online media, such as booklets, videos, and text messages. Based on the results of research, health education is effective in controlling perinatal depression. Conclusion: Health education can be used as an intervention to prevent perinatal depression, and implementation in the clinic needs to be integrated with support interventions.

AB  - Introduction: Mental health problems among adolescents remain a global public health concern, highlighting the need for accessible and innovative educational interventions. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a web-based mental health education model through the Genziheal platform in improving knowledge levels and reducing symptoms of mental health disorders among adolescent students. Methods: A quasi-experimental, pretest-posttest control group design was employed involving 130 senior high school students (intervention group: n=80; control group: n=50). Data were collected using the Self-Reporting Questionnaire-29 (SRQ-29) and a validated mental health knowledge questionnaire. Paired t-test and Mann-Whitney tests were used for analysis. Results: The intervention group demonstrated a significant increase in mental health knowledge (mean score improved from 11.0 ± 2.8 to 12.2 ± 3.2; p = 0.008), while no significant change was observed in the control group. However, no significant differences were found in mental health symptoms between pre-and post-test stages in both groups (p > 0.05). Conclusions: The Genziheal platform effectively enhanced students’ mental health literacy but did not significantly reduce symptoms of mental health disorders. These findings suggest that web-based educational tools can support mental health awareness among adolescents but should be complemented with parental involvement and professional support to address psychological symptoms. This study also highlights the potential integration of digital mental health interventions into school-based health promotion programs. The findings contribute to the development of scalable, culturally contextualized digital health promotion tools, particularly in resource-constrained settings such as Indonesia. © 2025 Jurnal Ners.

AB  - Introduction The majority of the world’s adolescents live in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, there is a dearth of knowledge about adolescents’ perspectives on mental health and sources of distress there. Therefore, a qualitative study of adolescents’ and caregivers’ beliefs and experiences related to mental illness was conducted in Nairobi, Kenya. Materials and methods Six focus group discussions were conducted with 46 participants at two peri-urban settlements in Nairobi from November to December 2020. Using a two-step analytic process, we generated core themes, and the study team reviewed the transcripts and triangulated the themes. Results Themes include knowledge about mental health and illness, triggers of psychological disturbances, attitudes towards mental illness, practices adopted to strengthen mental health, barriers to strengthening mental health among young people, emerging needs around caregiver mental health and parenting, and community recommendations on interventions. Adolescents had limited knowledge of specific mental illnesses but articulated triggers, stresses, and challenges they face in daily life in an in-depth manner. Caregivers demonstrated a breadth of knowledge and understanding of adolescent mental health. Conclusion Adolescents and their caregivers face tremendous stresses in the Nairobi settlements. Mental health literacy is limited, but adolescents and caregivers are ready to embrace mental health services. Reducing stigma and access to youth-friendly services are crucial to expanding service engagement. © 2025 Nyongesa et al.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Mental health literacy (MHL) plays a crucial role in transitional processes, influencing, for example, students’ adaptation to higher education and, later, their transition into the workforce. This study assesses MHL about depression among first- and fourth-year nursing students and identifies which MHL components and related variables are associated with a higher likelihood of being in either academic year. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive correlational study was conducted with 478 nursing students (59.4% first-year students; 40.6% fourth-year students), predominantly female (82.2%), with a mean age of 20.41 years (SD = 4.71) and a median age of 19.0 years. Results: The results revealed a low level of recognition of depression and knowledge of mental health first aid (MHFA) strategies, including health literacy. Students tended not to hold beliefs based on myths and stereotypes about mental illness and individuals with mental illness and did not have highly stigmatizing views. MHL varied by year of study, with fourth-year students having more adequate MHL levels. Conclusions: These findings highlight the need to integrate MHL as a key element of academic success. Health education initiatives that promote mental health, prevention, and MHFA training may serve as effective strategies to enhance MHL among nursing students. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - In Malaysia, parental concerns about adolescent mental health have increased exponentially in recent years. However, parental mental health literacy remains low and culturally-sensitive parenting resources are scarce in Malaysia. The Partners in Parenting (PiP) program provides a framework of evidence-based parenting domains (henceforth ‘PiP framework’) that are universally adaptive for adolescent mental health – presenting as a good candidate for implementation in other cultures. Guided by the Double Diamond framework, this study aimed to identify cultural considerations for localising PiP to the Malaysian context. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 38 primary caregivers (Mage = 47.1 years), who reflected on their parenting of their children during adolescence (aged 12–17 years). A thematic analysis using a deductive approach was conducted, using the PiP framework as a reference to identify cultural considerations in relation to five selected PiP parenting domains. Four overarching themes describing these cultural considerations were identified – Religion, Extended family, Gender roles, and Intergenerational influences – which were each relevant to one or more PiP parenting domains. These considerations, which reflect the complex interplay between parenting practices and the broader sociocultural environment in Malaysia, were further organised and interpreted within the context of the five interconnected cultural systems of the Bronfenbrenner socioecological model. Our approach facilitated a strategic, targeted localisation process, by identifying cultural considerations to be integrated into evidence-based intervention content. The context-specific implications for the localisation of PiP for Malaysia are discussed. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - Despite the global rise in child mental health difficulties, public understanding of young children’s mental health remains unclear. Parents play a pivotal role in supporting their children’s mental health and seeking professional help for concerns. Our mixed-methods systematic review sought to describe current levels of child mental health literacy (CMHL) among parents, examine variations across sociodemographic and clinical factors, and explore the relationship between CMHL and professional help-seeking. We searched six databases for English-language studies investigating any aspect of CMHL among parents of children aged 4–12 years in community settings, published in the last decade. From 26 studies across 12 countries (N = 5562), we found that parents generally had: (1) low to moderately low recognition, (2) diverse causal and other mental health beliefs (in Western and non-Western countries), (3) high levels of stigmatising beliefs and perceived stigma; (4) attitudes to professional help-seeking ranging from moderately positive to highly negative, and (5) low awareness of available help. Lower CMHL was associated with lower parental education level, being a father and less acculturated ethnic minorities, while higher CMHL was linked with previous service use. Help-seekers tended to have higher CMHL than non-help-seekers. Thus, disparities in parental CMHL may contribute to unequal access to mental health services. A more holistic, strengths-based and prevention-focused approach to CMHL in future research and measurement would inform intervention. Public health campaigns and targeted coproduced interventions to enhance the CMHL levels of parents with young children should form a key strategy for the promotion of child wellbeing. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Suicide remains a global mental health crisis requiring evidence-based policy interventions. South Korea has implemented effective suicide prevention strategies, such as pesticide restrictions, emergency room follow-ups, and media safety guidelines, successfully reducing suicide rates among older adults. However, since 2017, youth suicide rates have increased, highlighting gaps in existing policies. Addressing this issue requires innovative approaches, including mental health literacy programs, digital interventions, social media regulations, and holistic mental health policies. Continuous evaluation and adaptation of suicide prevention strategies are essential. South Korea's experience offers valuable insights, yet further efforts are needed to tackle evolving challenges in suicide prevention. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Self-stigma occurs when a person with a mental illness internalises the negative stereotypes and attitudes associated with their condition, which can lead to reduced help-seeking and social withdrawal. Previous research has demonstrated high levels of professional stigma towards people with personality disorder, but in contrast to mental disorders such as anxiety and depression, very little is known about self-stigma in people with personality disorder. We conducted an online, cross-sectional survey of 1009 people who had received a diagnosis of personality disorder, anxiety or depression to compare levels of self-stigma and identify associated factors. We assessed self-stigma using the Internalised Stigma of Mental Illness Scale-9 and demographic and clinical factors including level of personality disturbance, invalidating childhood experiences and depressive symptoms. In multilevel analysis, people diagnosed with personality disorder did not have higher levels of self-stigma than those with anxiety and depression. Levels of self-stigma were higher among those with higher levels of personality disturbance, depression and invalidating childhood experiences. These findings highlight the importance of personality disturbance in the development of self-stigma and the need for interventions to increase mental health literacy in this area. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Introduction: Psychological vulnerability and low mental health literacy correlate negatively with positive mental health in higher education students. These negative correlates delay recognizing mental disorders' manifestations and the search for professional help. Low levels of mental health literacy limit self-help, adaptative coping strategies, and academic success. However, few studies examine the association between students' psychological vulnerability, mental health literacy, and positive mental health. Objective: To explain the relationship between psychological vulnerability, mental health literacy and positive mental health in higher education students. Methods: A cross-sectional correlational study was used in a sample of 3600 undergraduate students. Results: Participants were mostly female (78.8%), with an average age of 23 years (SD = 6.68). The majority do not exercise, are dissatisfied with sleep quality time per night (62.1% sleep less than 7 hours per night), and do not have leisure activities. The majority have high levels of Psychological vulnerability, low literacy levels, and Personal Satisfaction; and 67,9% scored in the flourishing group. Results show significant differences (p<0.001) between sex, age, sleep, exercise, diet, leisure activities, Psychological vulnerability, positive mental health, and literacy. Conclusion: The results identify modifiable. Vulnerability factors justify intervention-targeted programs to promote literacy and positive mental health in higher education campuses in Portugal to empower students with effective well-being and self-help strategies. © 2025, Polytechnic Institute of Viseu.

AB  - This chapter was supported in part by the UCLA Depression Grand Challenge. It details the development of an evidence repository for interventions designed to improve mental health knowledge and attitudes in school settings. The repository aims to serve as a comprehensive, accessible resource for schools and organizations, focusing on evaluating mental health interventions' effectiveness and implementation readiness. The chapter outlines the development process, criteria for study evaluation, and its potential to help school communities select effective programs. It also examines the effectiveness of school-based interventions in reducing stigma and improving mental health literacy. Although these interventions show promise in short-term outcomes, their long-term effectiveness remains unclear, with many studies revealing diminished effects over time. The chapter identifies key areas for research, including understanding the ingredients of successful interventions, incorporating behavioral measures rather than just self-reported intentions, and enhancing statistical power in study designs. It emphasizes the need for robust implementation support, such as detailed manuals and organizational purveyors, to ensure the sustainability and fidelity of interventions in school settings. This repository seeks to be a valuable and practical tool for schools and organizations while highlighting areas for future research to foster supportive school environments and contribute to enhancing student mental health. © 2025 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation between Mental Health Knowledge and Peer Mental Health Stigmatization of adolescents. METHODOLOGY: This study employed a descriptive and correlational research design. Approximately 300 students from six junior high schools were selected by multi-stage random sampling as samples. The students' peer mental health stigmatization was measured using the 24 statements on the Peer Mental Health Stigmatization Scale (PMHSS), and their knowledge of mental health was collected using the 31 statements on the Mental Health Literacy Questionnaire (MHLq). The data was analyzed using frequency, mean, standard deviation, and Chi-Square Test. RESULTS: According to the Chi-Square Test, students' mental health knowledge and peer mental health stigmatization have a significant correlation (p = 0.000). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a significant correlation between mental health knowledge and peer mental health stigmatization among adolescents. The findings reveal that adolescents with higher levels of mental health knowledge are less likely to stigmatize peers facing mental health challenges. This suggests that increasing mental health literacy can play a crucial role in reducing peer mental health stigmatization. This result highlights the importance of mental health education programs to elevate the understanding and awareness of adolescents toward their mental health condition through psychosocial interventions and public awareness campaigns to reduce students' peer stigma. © 2025, Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences.

AB  - Background Depression and anxiety are prevalent mental health disorders among adolescents worldwide, including Bangladesh. However, mental health disorders are often overlooked in developing countries like Bangladesh. This study aims to assess the prevalence of depression and anxiety, as well as the socio-demographic factors that contribute to these conditions, among late adolescents aged 15–21 in Mymensingh division, Bangladesh. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted among 400 adolescents aged 15–21 in the Mymensingh division of Bangladesh. The study used a structured questionnaire to collect sociodemographic and lifestyle-related information from the respondents. The questionnaire included PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scales to assess depression and anxiety among the respondents. Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and ordinal logistic regression were performed as statistical analyses of this study. Results The overall prevalence of depression was 47.8% (33.5% moderate, 10.5% moderately severe, and 3.8% severe depression), and anxiety 32.8% (31% moderate and 1.8% severe anxiety). Across most of the socio-demographic and lifestyle-related factors, the prevalence of depression and anxiety was higher among adolescent boys. Individuals aged 19–21 are most likely to experience depression and anxiety. The study found that unmarried adolescents, mobile phone users, rural adolescents, and those whose parents had no formal education were more likely to experience moderate to severe depression and anxiety than their counterparts. The ordinal logistic regression revealed that adolescents whose fathers had no formal education were 2.77 times more likely to experience depression (95% CI = 1.21–6.35, p < 0.05). Besides depression was more likely to be associated with those who were businessmen (OR = 1.95; 95% CI = 1.02–3.72, p < 0.05), and day laborers (OR = 0.41; 95% CI = 0.20–0.82, p < 0.05) and living with anxiety (OR = 0.05; 95% CI = 0.01–0.24, p <.000). Anxiety is prevalent among adolescents who had no formal education (OR = 0.15; 95% CI = 0.03–0.75, p < 0.05), no family savings (OR = 0.42; 95% CI = 0.23–0.78, p < 0.05) and depression (OR = 0.06; 95% CI = 0.01–0.22, p < 0.05). Conclusions The findings of this study emphasize the importance of screening individuals for depressive and anxiety disorder symptoms to reduce the prevalence of mental health disorders among adolescents. In addition to screening, policymakers should incorporate policies to increase access to mental health services and promote mental health education for parents and the community. © 2025 Khatun et al.

AB  - Rates of self-harm among young women have been increasing in recent years across multiple high-income nations. Given the negative outcomes associated with self-harm, it is essential that young women who engage in self-harm receive the support that best addresses their specific needs. The aim of the current study is to explore support preferences among Australian young women with a history of self-harm. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 27 young women (M = 20.9, SD = 2.1) with a history of self-harm, recruited through social media posts. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using a Reflexive Thematic Analysis approach. Thematic analysis of the data identified themes pertaining to the following: (1) the types of support young women want around self-harm, and (2) how young women would like to receive support for self-harm. Regarding the former, participants expressed wanting information about self-harm and self-harm interventions, education about self-harm for those around them, age-specific mental health education, and alternative coping strategies. Some participants expressed not wanting any support. Regarding the latter, participants wanted self-harm information to be provided by health professionals and in school settings, and preferred for information to be provided in written or digital forms. The findings highlight the need to improve access to formal mental health support among young women, the importance of young people being able to access support confidentially, and the need for young peoples’ caregivers and health professionals to be educated about self-harm. Additionally, the findings support a role for schools in providing information about mental health and available support. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - One of the strategies to address the persistent youth mental health crisis is school-based educational programming. This paper reports on two distinct studies regarding Coming Up for AIR, a school-based mental health education program: (1) program effectiveness, measured as gains in student mental health literacy; and (2) trends in help-seeking behavior before, during, and after the pandemic. A survey on program content was administered to assess program effectiveness. Data collected between 2020 and 2023 from four schools yielded 473 responses. A comparison of pre- and post-scores demonstrated statistically significant gains in program content. Mental health literacy improved across gender and grade level (8th, 9th, and 10th), as well as for students with prior exposure to a mental health curriculum. In the second study, help-seeking behavior was evaluated before, during, and after the pandemic. While other programs measure intention, Coming Up for AIR measures actual behavior as students can ask for help for themselves or a friend. Data did not reflect individual student responses, but rather were aggregated and provided the number of students per presentation who requested help. Archived declaration card data from January 2019 through February 2024 was accessed, representing 28 different schools and 16,289 middle and high school student responses. School-level data were analyzed by grade level (middle school or high school) and date (pre-, intra-, or post-COVID-19). Significant differences in self-referral were found for both grade level and presentation date. Self-referrals were significantly higher post-COVID-19 compared to pre-COVID-19 with middle schoolers increasing 90% and high school students increasing 36%. Analysis of friend referrals showed a significant difference for grade level, but not presentation date. Again, middle school students were more likely to make a referral than high schoolers. The data suggest that the mental health crisis in middle school students persists at an alarming rate. Schools are at the forefront of addressing mental health issues for youth. External educational programming can bring awareness to mental health concerns and promote help-seeking in youth. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Aim: Treatment for youth who are at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR-P) presents an opportunity for early intervention with the capacity to decrease the burden associated with a potential psychotic disorder later in life. However, significant barriers prevent youth at CHR-P from accessing speciality mental health services. Few studies have examined the pathways to care for youth at CHR-P within the U.S. health system. Methods: The present study reports the results of a codebook thematic analysis of qualitative interviews conducted with caregivers (primarily parents) of 15 youth (ages 12–25 years) who entered a CHR-P speciality program. Using a semi-structured interview, we inquired about their experiences navigating the health system to eventually arrive at the speciality program, including help-seeking events and referrals, caregivers' attributions for youths' CHR-P symptoms, and barriers and facilitators to care. Results: Caregivers reported confusion and uncertainty regarding the causes of symptoms. They also disclosed the significant challenges to obtaining mental health care, including low mental health literacy, illness stigma, provider unavailability or appropriateness and adequacy of referrals. Most of the youth had encounters with emergency services during their help-seeking journey. Conclusion: Our results help define targets for future policy, research and clinical efforts to improve access to speciality care for youth at CHR-P in the U.S. © 2025 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

AB  - Introduction: Reducing the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) is a cornerstone of effective early intervention for psychosis (EIP) services. Delays in help seeking are a significant component of DUP, particularly among youth. Given their role as trusted adults in young people's lives, youth workers are uniquely positioned to play a role in early detection networks. However, their views regarding this remain largely unexamined. Aim: This study aimed to explore youth workers' perspectives on identifying and responding to psychosis in youth and the training needed to support them in this role. Methods: A sequential-independent mixed methods design was employed. A brief questionnaire was given to youth workers (n = 86) who attended a 1-day EIP training session, followed by semi-structured interviews with a subset of participants (n = 10) 3 months later. Results: Most participants (98.8%) expressed confidence in recognising psychosis; however, stigma and challenging relationships with mental health services emerged as systemic barriers. Although most participants (98.8%) found the EIP training relevant to their role, they suggested it should form part of a broader mental health curriculum. There was a clear consensus among participants that such training is necessary and should be accessible, practical and actionable. Conclusion: Youth workers are uniquely positioned in identifying and supporting young people at risk of psychosis, and this study underscores their willingness to take on this role. To best support them, training efforts should focus on trans-diagnostic approaches that enhance mental health literacy, address systemic barriers and promote multidisciplinary partnerships. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Telehealth allows access to high-quality, holistic patient care, including diagnosis, interventions, treatments, monitoring, and patient education. As the use of telehealth continues to increase, faculty considered the need for entry-level nursing students to be introduced to telehealth and its services. Faculty from the medical-surgical II and mental health courses developed a learning experience for students that blends concepts from both courses, as patients often present with multiple problems. The telehealth experience helped students utilize assessment skills, learn delegation, and connect concepts from two courses to provide care for a patient remotely. © 2025 National League for Nursing.

AB  - A 12-year-old female presented with lower abdominal pain and hematuria following the self-insertion of a pencil into her bladder. Imaging revealed a 10.2 cm radiopaque object, which was removed intact via cystoscopy. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and psychiatric evaluation diagnosed mild depression, highlighting the need for integrated psychosocial intervention. This case underscores the critical importance of a multidisciplinary approach that combines medical and psychosocial care in the management of intravesical foreign bodies, particularly in pediatric populations. Proactive measures, including mental health education and early psychosocial support, are essential for prevention and recurrence mitigation. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - Aims: Parental understanding of mental health difficulties in young children is crucial for early intervention and support, yet child mental health is often misconceived and stigmatized. The Parental Child Mental Health Literacy Questionnaire (PCMHLQ) was developed to measure parents’ literacy of child mental health and piloted in a general community sample of parents in the UK. Subjects and methods: The measure was developed in a three-stage process and piloted in 211 parents of children aged 4 – 11 years. Factor structure, convergent validity, and construct validity were assessed. Results: The final 23-item version produced a five-factor model corresponding to (1) beliefs, (2) fear of stigma or shame, (3) help-seeking confidence, (4) recognition, and (5) knowledge related to young children's mental health. Four factors had acceptable to high internal reliability. Total PCMHLQ was associated with adult mental health literacy and physical health literacy scores. PCMHLQ scores were lower for parents with a child with mental health difficulties, parents with current mental health difficulties, fathers, and low-income parents. Non-White ethnic minority parents held more negative child mental health beliefs, but did not differ in other scales, and parents who had a history of mental health service access had higher recognition but lower help-seeking confidence. Conclusion: This paper describes the first integrated measure of parental literacy in young children's mental health. Preliminary evidence suggests that the 23-item PCMHLQ has the potential to identify parents with low understanding and to inform tailored community-based interventions and public health initiatives. © 2025 The Author(s)

AB  - Background: Universal, classroom-based mental health literacy (MHL) curricula are associated with improved mental health knowledge, attitudes, and help-seeking behaviors. Young adolescents are an ideal target given their need for and receptivity toward MHL education. Methods: We conducted a scoping review to identify universal, school-based MHL programs primarily for students aged 10–14 years, with adequate descriptions of curriculum implementation and content, and measured outcomes. Findings: Thirty-one articles describing 24 programs met the inclusion criteria. The content and educational strategies varied, with no two programs having the same curriculum. The studies show promising results for improvement in mental health knowledge, attitudes, help-seeking, and student mental health. Implications for School Health Policy, Practice, and Equity: Collaborative work between educational and mental health professionals, along with rigorous study of outcomes, aiming to reach a consensus on a core MHL curriculum and best implementation practices, will advance efforts to improve MHL. Conclusions: This scoping review confirmed that existing universal, school-based MHL programs for middle school-aged students improve mental health knowledge. The programs are diverse, and their outcomes are often challenging to compare. Ongoing study in this field to optimize design and implementation for improved effectiveness is needed. © 2024 American School Health Association.

AB  - Educators and school staff are critical to recognizing and supporting students' mental health, but frequently do not have the training to confidently bring mental health literacy into the classroom or assist students who experience distress. Moreover, few free, easily accessible trainings are available for this audience. Classroom Well-being Information and Strategies for Educators (Classroom WISE) is a free, K-12 mental health literacy training package that includes a self-paced online course, video library, and resource collection. Using pre- and postcourse anonymous surveys from over 2000 educators, school mental health professionals, and school staff who completed Classroom WISE, this study found high levels of satisfaction, significant increases in mental health literacy knowledge, high perceived importance of mastering skills to promote student well-being, and increased preparedness to implement mental health-related strategies. Participants reported intentions to bring mental health literacy into the classroom, and identified barriers and facilitators to using Classroom WISE that leaders can respond to or employ when moving to implement Classroom WISE across a school or district. School district or school-wide use of Classroom WISE can assist in building a safe and supportive school environment and help students in need to access mental health services. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Background: It is crucial to prioritize mental health (MH) promotion among adolescents, as the initial onset of mental illnesses commonly occurs during this developmental stage. Adopting a multi-pronged approach to mental health literacy (MHL) may help promote adolescent mental well-being. Objective: We aimed to determine baseline adolescents’ knowledge and attitudes on mental illness and any changes following a multidimensional MHL program. Method: A pre-post study was conducted among 600 adolescents in grades 10-12 recruited by multistage sampling in southwest Nigeria. MHL training was implemented using multidimensional tools which included peer-led education, MH booklets, posters, and role plays over a six-week period. Pre-and post-intervention questionnaire data on the knowledge and attitudes of respondents on MH issues were collected and analyzed. Results: Of 600 students, 594 (99%) [mean age of 14.87 (SD 1.44), a range of 11-21 years, and a female: male ratio of 1.3:1] completed the study. Post-intervention there were significant improvements in some but not all domains assessed. Participants’ views on care seeking and willingness for friendship improved post-intervention with a significant reduction in the concern for personal safety as a reason for unwillingness for friendship. Mean knowledge scores significantly increased from 11.89 (SD 2.56) to 13.51 (SD 2.62). Conclusions: The findings suggest that school-based multidimensional interventions may improve MHL. However, additional studies are needed to more rigorously assess their impact to inform effective integration of MHL into school curricula to enhance adolescent MHL. © 2025, Canadian Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.

AB  - The mental health of adolescents is a topic of increasing importance in our society. Knowing the mental health literacy of this population may provide key information to improve prevention and intervention policies. This research analyses the psychometric properties of the MHLq-E Spanish version, a self-administered self-report questionnaire on mental health literacy, specific to the adolescent population. A descriptive cross-sectional study including a representative sample of Spanish adolescents aged 12–16 years (N = 1000) was conducted. Results reveal a four-factor structure: help-seeking; stigma; knowledge of causes; knowledge of symptomatology. The selected four-factor solution accounts for 35% of the shared variance. High internal consistency, item reliability and good measures of validity were found. The global reliability of the questionnaire was α = 0.92 and ω<inf>t</inf> = 0.94. The reliability of the dimensions ranged from α = 0.79, ω<inf>t</inf> = 0.79 for Stigma to α = 0.87, ω<inf>t</inf> = 0.87 for Help. Factor loads were significant and above 0.4 suggesting appropriate convergent validity, and evidence of discriminant validity was also adequate. Although it differs from the original instrument, the analysis is consistent with other research and highlights the multiple dimensions of mental health literacy. The MHLq-E is the first instrument available in Spanish to assess mental health literacy in adolescents in Spain. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Pacific Islander youth face disproportionately high rates of suicide and mental health challenges, yet culturally appropriate interventions remain scarce. This study investigated whether culturally adapted bibliotherapy could effectively promote resilience in American Samoan children by incorporating culturally relevant stories and coping strategies. Through collaboration with on-island Samoan cultural brokers, we developed and implemented culturally adapted stories and lessons designed to resonate with the experiences of children in American Samoa. The study employed a mixed-methods approach with 34 American Samoan children aged 5–13 years, using observations, adapted card sorts, and forced-choice procedures to measure responses to the intervention. The results demonstrated that participants showed strong identification with the culturally adapted stories and characters, actively engaged with the embedded coping strategies, and reported increased confidence in applying resilience techniques. These findings suggest that culturally adapted bibliotherapy holds promise as an effective method for promoting resilience in Pacific Islander children while highlighting the importance of cultural authenticity in mental health interventions. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Background Adolescent mental illness is of increasing concern, with a high prevalence in many parts of the world. Early engagement, detection and receiving support are warranted to reduce the severity of symptoms. Increasing mental health literacy (MHL) through sport to adolescents is one way of engaging young people and signposting them to services. The aim of this systematic review was to identify the effect of interventions, risk of bias, and theoretical application in sport-based adolescent mental health awareness programmes. Methods: Six electronic databases (MEDLINE Ovid, PsycINFO, Scopus, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, Cochrane) were searched from 2012 to September 2022 (updated January 2024). Inclusion criteria stated the sample had to include adolescents aged 11–17 years, include mental health outcomes, and a sport component. Results: Six studies met the inclusion criteria. Sample size ranged from nine to 816 participants. Four distinct sport-based programmes were evaluated, with three interventions applying a psychological behaviour change theory. The results of the interventions indicated positive effects on several indices of MHL, such as increased knowledge of mental health, depression and anxiety literacy and the recognition of disorders, increased resilience and intentions to provide help. It was found that addressing stigma remains a challenge. The interventions produced the most significant effects for those who scored lower at baseline measures and the younger cohorts. Conclusions: Sport is useful for the engagement and dissemination of mental health awareness information to adolescents. Given the limited number of psychological theory informed interventions, there is a need for further interventions that explicitly adopt behaviour change theories and improve the quality of research design for these interventions. The findings from this review will be of interest to health promotion and public health practitioners and those designing mental health awareness programmes for adolescents. © 2025 Sullivan et al.

AB  - Mental health challenges among children and adolescents have become a pressing global concern, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing geopolitical instability. Addressing these issues requires innovative, cost-effective strategies, with schools serving as critical platforms for mental health promotion. This study evaluates the impact of an online training program, Well@School, designed to enhance Mental Health Literacy (MHL) among primary school professionals in Finland, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Slovenia, and Greece. Using a descriptive, cross-sectional design with pre- and post-test assessments, the study involved 223 health, education, and social care professionals. The revised Mental Health Literacy Scale (MHLS) was employed to measure changes in MHL. Results indicated a significant positive effect, with an average increase of 4 points (2.5%) in MHLS scores post-course. Bayesian analysis further confirmed this improvement, showing a high probability (99.92%) of a positive impact, with the most likely gain ranging between 3 and 5 points. The findings underscore the potential of online training programs to enhance MHL among school professionals, thereby improving their capacity to support students’ mental health. This study highlights the importance of equipping primary school staff with the necessary skills to recognize and address mental health challenges, reduce stigma, and foster a supportive school environment. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Mental health issues are a prominent burden among adolescents and young adults in Southeast Asia, compounded by reluctance to seek help and low treatment rates. This mixed-method systematic review analyzed help-seeking profiles (preference, facilitators, and barriers) and evaluated implemented help-seeking programs. Data were sourced from electronic databases, hand-searched local databases, conference proceedings, and grey literature. Study selection followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines, focusing on 1) adolescents (10–19 years) and young adults (18–26 years) in Southeast Asia who were not receiving mental health care, 2) assessing help-seeking behavior, and 3) evaluating programs to increase help-seeking. A total of 16 articles were identified. Help-seeking behavior in Southeast Asian youth was shaped by mental health literacy and stigma (including attitudes from family, peers, and the wider community). Program effectiveness was mixed, with improvement often lacking significant differences from control groups or failing to persist at follow-up. These findings emphasized the need for more community-level and upstream policy interventions alongside individual-level interventions to improve mental health literacy and stigma. Developing interventions requires methodological improvements in help-seeking research, and ultimately, accessible and trustworthy mental health services are crucial to sustaining progress. © @ 2025, Kesmas: Jurnal Kesehatan Masyarakat Nasional.

AB  - Background Training healthcare professionals in human rights approaches is fundamental for humanizing medical practice and promoting patient autonomy. Aims To evaluate the impact of Quality Rights strategy training on human rights engagement, stigma reduction and attitudes towards mental health among medical students in Colombian. Method A pre-experimental study with pre-post measures was conducted, involving 194 medical students, during the first semester of 2024 in Manizales, Caldas, Colombia. To assess notions and commitment to human rights were used the Human Rights Exposure in Social Work and Human Rights Engagement in Social Work. Attitudes toward people with mental disorders were measured using the Community Attitudes Towards the Mentally III (CAMI) scale, and attitudes toward mental health education were assessed using the Mental Illness Clinicians’ Attitude Scale (MICA). The intervention was based on QualityRights, an initiative of the World Health Organization, which aims to improve the quality of care in mental health services and to promote the human rights of people with psychosocial disabilities. Initial data comparisons were made using the Mann-Whitney U test and the Kruskal-Wallis test. Pretest and postest data were compared using the Wilcoxon test. Results Statistically significant improvements were observed in human rights understanding, reduced stigmatizing attitudes toward mental health and decreased authoritarianism. While students demonstrated enhanced human rights knowledge and less stigmatizing attitudes, we observed a concurrent decrease in benevolence scores. Conclusion The Quality Rights training strategy shows promise in improving medical students’ understanding of mental health conditions and promoting empathetic practices. However, ongoing sustained and monitoring strategies are necessary to ensure long-term adoption of human rights-based attitudes and practices in healthcare settings. © 2025 Agudelo-Hernández et al.

AB  - Background and Objective: Adolescents’ mental health, including depression and anxiety, represent a global public health problem. However, there is a paucity of data on depression and anxiety among adolescents in Sudan. Therefore, the current study aimed to investigate the prevalence and associated factors for depression and anxiety among adolescents in Northern Sudan. Methods: This school-based cross-sectional study was conducted at randomly selected schools from August to September 2022 in Almatamah, River Nile State, Sudan. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected using a face-to-face questionnaire. Depression and anxiety were measured using the questionnaire tools of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), respectively. Univariate and multivariate binary analyses were performed to determine the associated factors of depression and anxiety using the adjusted odd ratios (AOR) and 95.0% confidence interval (CI). Results: Of 384 adolescents, 178 (46.4%) and 206 (53.6%) were boys and girls, respectively. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) of age was 15.1 (14.0–16.3) years old. Of the total adolescents, 311 (81.0%), 42 (10.9%), 20 (5.2%), 7 (1.8%), and 4 (1.0%) had no, mild, moderate, moderate to severe, and severe depression, respectively. Of the total, 31 (8.1%) adolescents had moderate or severe depression (depression score ≥ 10). In multivariable binary analysis, female gender (AOR = 5.35, 95% CI 1.67–17.09) and anxiety (AOR = 25.98, 95% CI 7.68–87.90) were associated with increased odds of depression; there was no association between age, father’s education, and BMI for age Z-score and depression. Of the 384 adolescents, 320 (83.3%), 47 (12.2%), 11 (2.9%), and 6 (1.6%) had no mild, moderate, and severe anxiety, respectively. Of the total, 17 (4.4%) had moderate and or severe anxiety (anxiety score ≥ 10). In multivariable logistic regressions, while family history of mental disorder (AOR = 6.31, 95% CI 1.36–29.27), being anemic (AOR = 3.95, 95% CI 1.19–13.12), and depression (AOR = 29.03, 95% CI 7.52–112.05) were associated with increased odds of anxiety; there was no association between age, gender, father’s occupation, and BMI for age Z-score and anxiety. Conclusions: The findings indicate that 1 in 10 adolescents in Northern Sudan experiences at least one mental disorder, encompassing depression, anxiety, or a combination of both. Notably, female adolescents are at a higher risk for depression, while factors such as a family history of mental disorders and anemia significantly contribute to anxiety levels. To address these pressing mental health concerns, it is imperative to implement inclusive and holistic programs that incorporate nutritional support, integrate mental health education into school curricula, and introduce community-based interventions aiming to enhance mental well-being among all adolescents, irrespective of gender. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Mental health problems are a major cause of disability, impacting nearly 20% of adolescents. Nevertheless, they are hesitant to seek help because of stigma and fear of being labelled. Adolescents often have low mental health literacy and perceive mental health problems as personal failures. To address it, our study aimed to identify subgroups within the adolescent population based on mental health knowledge, social stigma, experiences of intergroup anxiety, and endorsement of stereotypes. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 182 adolescents (50.6% male) aged 10 to 17 years (M = 13.8, SD = 2.4). Participants completed an online survey comprising the Mental Health Knowledge Schedule, Attribution Questionnaire (AQ-8-C), Intergroup Anxiety Scale, and a scale regarding stereotypes towards people with mental health problems. Cluster analysis was used to identify the subgroups. Results: We identified three subgroups: (1) “Potential Advocates”, showing high mental health knowledge, low social stigma, low intergroup anxiety, and moderate endorsement of stereotypes; (2) “Ambivalents”, manifesting high mental health knowledge, moderate social stigma, heightened intergroup anxiety, and low endorsement of stereotypes; and (3) “Stigmatizers”, revealing low mental health knowledge, pronounced social stigma, moderate intergroup anxiety, and tendency to endorse stereotypes. Conclusions: The results highlight the multiplicity of perceptions regarding mental health and the pivotal role of knowledge, stigma, intergroup dynamics, and stereotypes in shaping attitudes. Implications for interventions targeting mental health stigma and fostering positive attitudes among adolescents are discussed, underscoring the importance of customised strategies to address the multiple needs and experiences characteristic of this developmental stage. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Background/Objectives: We aim to assess the effect of the Espaijove.net mental health literacy program on adolescents’ quality of life (QOL). Additionally, we aim to describe their QOL and mental well-being. Methods: A multicenter, randomized, controlled trial was conducted, with pre- and post-intervention assessments and 6- and 12-month follow-ups. A total of 1032 students aged 13–14 from 18 schools in Barcelona participated in one of the three following mental health literacy (MHL) programs or were placed in a control group (CG): (1) a 1 h awareness session (G1h); (2) a 6 h MHL program (G6h); (3) a 7 h MHL program with stigma reduction (G7h). Measures: (1) Mental well-being: Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ); (2) QOL: EuroQol 5D-5L with its two parts: the EuroQol 5D-5L Index (0–1) and EuroQol 5D-5L visual analog scale (EQ-VAS) (0–100). Analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis, using data imputation methods for missing data. Intervention effects were assessed using multilevel models. Results: Baseline EQ-VAS and EQ-5D-5L index scores were 77.84 (CI = 76.77–78.91) and 0.91 (CI = 0.90–0.92), respectively. Boys reported higher QOL and SDQ scores (p < 0.001), whereas participants of foreign nationality showed lower scores in QOL (EQ-VAS; p = 0.039) and mental well-being (p < 0.001). Post-intervention, all groups (intervention and control), except G6h, showed QOL improvements. However, in the 6-month follow-up, the CG outperformed the other groups. At 12 months, G7h achieved the highest EQ-VAS scores compared to the other groups. Conclusions: MHL-based interventions improved short-term QOL but failed to sustain these improvements over time. Groups with lower QOL and SDQ scores included girls and adolescents of foreign nationality. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Depression is among the most prevalent mental health issues affecting adolescents. Parents may play an important role in identifying warning signs of depression and providing support. However, little is known about how parents understand and respond to the early signs of adolescent depression, or their depression literacy (DL). The factors associated with their DL are also unclear. This questionnaire-based study aimed to explore DL in a sample of primary caregivers (n = 321, M<inf>age</inf> = 46.2 years, 76% female) of 12–18-year-old adolescents living in the Republic of Ireland, through responses to a vignette depicting a character displaying symptoms of depression. Two-thirds (66.7%) attributed the character’s symptoms to depression, while 92.2% believed the character needed help. One third (34.6%) believed asking the adolescent about suicide would be harmful. Only parent empathy significantly predicted labelling the symptoms as ‘depression’. Contrary to hypotheses, there were no significant differences identified based on parents’ gender, their child’s gender, or their child’s age. To our knowledge, this study is the first to explore the link between empathy and DL in parents, and may inform targeted interventions to improve DL. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Background: Despite its importance, Mental health literacy (MHL) among nursing and other health profession students often remains inadequate, potentially impacting their future roles as healthcare providers. This inadequacy can lead to delayed or inappropriate care for individuals with mental health concerns, perpetuating adverse outcomes and increasing the burden on healthcare systems. Aim: To evaluate a digital-based intervention designed to enhance the warning signs of mental health literacy among health profession students. Design: A quasi-experimental, one-group pretest-posttest study design was used to conduct the current study. Methods: A non-randomized trial was conducted using digital mental health literacy intervention about the warning signs of mental illness (DWS), involving a convenience sample of 493 undergraduate health profession students. Mental Health Literacy Survey About Warning Signs of Mental Illness was developed and validated to measure the participants' mental health literacy before and after the intervention. Results: Almost all Warning Signs of Mental Illness Literacy items were significantly increased from pre- to post-intervention. Both sub-sums representing the knowledge subscale (items 1 to 11) and attitude subscale (items 12 to 15) significantly increased to 4.4 (CI 3.7, 5.0) and 0.7 (CI 0.5, 0.9), respectively. Differences were more extensive and significant on the knowledge subscale items 0.4 (CI 0.3, 0.5) than on the attitude subscale mean items 0.2 (CI 0.1, 0.2). Conclusion: The DWS is an effective and easy-to-use education program for health profession students. The current study is an initial step toward building a body of knowledge about mental health literacy in the region. © 2025

AB  - Indonesian adolescents face an increased risk of developing mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety, largely due to insufficient mental health literacy and awareness. This lack of knowledge often leads to delayed recognition and treatment. To address this, the present descriptive qualitative study explores Indonesian adolescents' perceptions of mental health challenges and needs. Fourteen adolescents from two public schools in Indonesia were selected through purposive sampling based on their mental health literacy scores (either high or low). One-on-one semi-structured interviews were conducted in December 2023, and thematic analysis was used to uncover key patterns and themes. The study follows the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research guidelines. Three main themes emerged: (1) Transitioning to Adulthood: Journeys Through Emotional Turmoil and Societal Expectations, (2) Navigating Challenges: Diverse Adolescent Responses and (3) Breaking the Silence: Empowering Adolescents Through Comprehensive Mental Health Education and Support. This study found that adolescents faced specific challenges related to emotional regulation, body image and self-esteem, academic pressure and the influence of social media. In response to these difficulties, they employed various coping mechanisms, both adaptive and maladaptive. Despite the adversities, adolescents expressed a strong desire to learn how to better manage these challenges and pursue their future career goals. These findings highlight the importance of developing culturally appropriate mental health education and support programs for Indonesian adolescents. Future studies should include a more diverse sample of adolescents and incorporate perspectives from parents and educators to gain a more comprehensive understanding of adolescent mental health in Indonesia. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Simulation-based training in mental health is increasingly recognised as an effective tool within nursing education. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of various simulation modalities, including standardised participants (SPs), role-plays, virtual reality (VR), mannequins and voice simulations, in improving educational outcomes for nursing students. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify studies evaluating the impact of mental health simulation on nursing education. Data from 62 studies were extracted and analysed. The primary outcomes included knowledge, confidence, self-efficacy, competence and anxiety. Meta-analyses assessed both pretest/posttest changes and comparisons between simulation and control groups. Pretest/posttest analyses revealed significant improvements across multiple modalities: SPs enhanced knowledge (SMD = 1.26), confidence (SMD = 1.20), self-efficacy (SMD = 0.94), attitude (SMD = 0.22), competence (SMD = 2.30) and anxiety reduction (SMD = −0.88). Role-plays demonstrated gains in knowledge (SMD = 0.87), confidence (SMD = 1.24), self-efficacy (SMD = 0.74), attitude (SMD = 0.53), competence (SMD = 0.82) and reduced anxiety (SMD = −0.73). VR improved knowledge (SMD = 0.86), self-efficacy (SMD = 0.75) and competence (SMD = 0.69). Mannequins showed no significant changes in knowledge or competence. Voice simulations improved knowledge (SMD = 0.96). Comparisons with control groups indicated that SPs significantly increased knowledge (SMD = 1.31), competence (SMD = 1.51) and reduced anxiety (SMD = −2.01). Role-plays enhanced knowledge (SMD = 1.03) compared with inactive controls; VR increased knowledge (SMD = 0.86) compared with controls. Mannequins showed no significant differences, and voice simulations lacked sufficient data for comprehensive analysis. This meta-analysis underscores the value of simulation-based training in mental health nursing education, with SPs proving particularly effective in enhancing clinical preparedness. Role-plays, VR and voice simulations offer supplementary benefits but may require integration with more interactive methods for optimal impact. Future research should prioritise high-quality randomised controlled trials, standardised simulation protocols and long-term follow-up to clarify the sustained effects of simulation training on clinical practice. © 2025 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

AB  - Adolescents are susceptible to developing depression and anxiety, and educational interventions could improve their mental well-being. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of universal educational prevention interventions in improving mental health literacy, depression, and anxiety among adolescents. Eight electronic databases were searched until June 2024: Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest Dissertations, and Theses Global. Since the included studies assessed various aspects of mental health literacy, the results for mental health literacy were synthesized narratively. In contrast, a meta-analysis using a random-effects model was applied to the depression and anxiety outcomes. Heterogeneity was examined using I2 statistics and Cochran's Q Chi-squared test. The Cochrane risk of bias tool and the GRADE approach conducted quality appraisal at the study and outcome levels, respectively. The review was reported according to the PRISMA guidelines. This review included 34 randomized controlled trials. Universal education prevention interventions were found to be promising in improving adolescents' mental health literacy but showed limited effects on individual mental health literacy components and on reducing depression (SMD = −0.06, 95%CI: [−0.11, −0.02], Z = 2.58, p = 0.01, I2 = 45%) and anxiety (SMD = −0.00, 95%CI: [−0.06, 0.06], Z = 0.07, p = 0.94, I2 = 58%) at post-intervention. Future trials should consider using a hybrid delivery model utilizing health care and the non-health care professionals. These interventions must incorporate skills-based sessions to develop emotional regulation strategies, complemented by extended follow-up periods that include booster sessions to reinforce learning. Given the very low quality of evidence as rated by the GRADE approach, current findings need to be interpreted with caution. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

AB  - There is a global mental health crisis: mental illness is underrecognized, underdiagnosed, and undertreated with adverse effects on mental, physical, and social health. In the United States, there is an insufficient number of traditional psychiatric and psychological resources to provide the mental health care needed to solve this crisis. Community-based interventions could be an important adjunct to traditional mental health care. An evaluation of peer-reviewed articles was performed describing community-based interventions and identified 3 approaches with some evidence of effectiveness: (1) interventions that enhance community mental health literacy to improve recognition of early signs of mental illness for early engagement and provide community, family, and peer support; (2) community clinics providing social, medical, and mental health care and support to transition-age youth (15-25 years); and (3) social networking activities to enhance interactions among elders suffering from social isolation and loneliness. Multisector, multidisciplinary, and multicomponent interventions involving health care providers and community-based organizations had the best evidence of effectiveness and should target transition-age youth and elders. © 2025, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.

AB  - There is an urgent need for improved school-based mental health services to address students’ increasing mental health needs. School nurses are often at the frontlines of youth mental health, but report feeling unprepared to manage student needs due to limited training. We conducted a rapid review to identify evidence-based mental health educational interventions for school nurses and evaluate program characteristics. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. While the literature evaluating mental health training programs for school nurses is limited, it suggests that training may improve school nurse knowledge, confidence, and preparedness to address student mental health needs and improve the management of student mental health. Additionally, it highlighted the importance of support, resources, and policies that foster mental health promotion. Future research should focus on obtaining a current assessment of school nurse mental health education needs, evaluating existing interventions, and developing more evidence-based mental health training programs for school nurses. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Men are less likely to seek help for their mental health than women, but less is known about the specific patterns of help-seeking in adolescent boys and young men. This is concerning as adolescent boys and young men have high suicide rates but a low take-up of services. It is therefore of particular importance that the access needs of this group are understood. This review sought to identify the barriers and facilitators faced by adolescent boys and young men in help-seeking for affective mental health disorders. A search of the PubMed, APA PsycInfo, and Cochrane databases identified 3961 articles, of which 12 met the inclusion criteria. Six of the studies were qualitative, five were quantitative and one used mixed methods. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the quality of the articles. Five key themes were identified, including the impact of social norms, with the subthemes of conformity to masculine norms and self-stigma, limited availability of information about mental health, and ‘male-friendly’ mental health literacy campaigns. Other themes referred to the help-seeking preferences of adolescent boys and young men, in terms of informal or formal and online or offline help-seeking. Some of the factors were well-researched (e.g., conformity to masculine norms as a barrier) whereas other factors (e.g., self-compassion as a facilitator) were less researched. These barriers and facilitators need to be considered in the development of future strategies to improve the help-seeking behaviour of adolescent boys and young men. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Studies show that mental health promotion is an effective strategy that can reduce the burden of mental health disorders and improve overall well-being in both children and adults. In addition to promoting high levels of mental well-being and preventing the onset of mental illness, these mental health promotion programmes, including mental illness prevention interventions, help increase levels of mental health literacy in community members. While there is evidence showing the effectiveness of mental health promotion, much of what is known about this field is informed by studies conducted in high-income countries. There is a need to gather evidence about the effectiveness of such interventions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where mental health services are often inadequate. In this systematic review, we synthesised the available published primary evidence from sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) on the types and effectiveness of mental health promotion programmes for young people. We performed a search of selected global databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, ScienceDirect and Google Scholar) and regional databases (Sabinet African Journals). We included observational, mixed methods, trials, pilots and quantitative original papers published from 2013 to 2023. We used the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) to evaluate the quality of methods in selected studies, and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement (PRISMA-2020) for reporting the evidence gathered. We identified 15 types of youth mental health promotion and illness prevention interventions. Among those identified, we found that school-based interventions enhanced mental health literacy, mental health-seeking behaviours and self-assurance and confidence among young people. Family-based interventions also showed a potential to improve relationships between young people and their caregivers. Future studies should explore how to further strengthen school- and family-based interventions that promote mental health among young people. © The Author(s), 2025.

AB  - Background: The growing prevalence of substance abuse and other defective behaviors linked with depression among adolescents has resulted in greater concern. Objective: This study assessed smoking behavior, alcohol intake and depressive symptoms among adolescents attending public secondary schools in Abeokuta. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among secondary school adolescents in Abeokuta, Ogun state, Nigeria. A modified Global School-based Student Health Survey questionnaire was used to obtain information on socio-economic and demographic characteristics, and alcohol and drug use. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 was used to assess depressive disorder symptoms. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics in SPSS version 21. Statistical significance association was established at p≤0.05. Results: The results revealed that 76.9% were within the age range of 15-19 years. Although majority (87.4%) reported not smoking cigarettes, 54.4% had ever taken alcohol, 29.5% consumed alcohol within the previous month and 33.1% reported age ≤ 13 years at first intake of alcohol. Prevalence of mild to moderately-severe symptoms of depression was 44.0% with mild (36%) and moderate (7.3%) symptoms being the most common. The age of respondents (X2 = 7.646, p=0.024), father's occupation (X2 = 9.76, p=0.045), who the respondent lived with (X2 = 8.81, p=0.003), age at first cigarette trial (X2 = 17.015, p = 0.000), use of other tobacco products (X2 = 11.374, p = 0.003) and number of days smoked (X2 = 10.117, p = 0.006) were significantly associated with depressive symptoms. Conclusion: There was higher prevalence of alcohol use compared to cigarette smoking or use of other tobacco products among the adolescents. Mild and moderate depressive disorder symptoms are common suggesting a need for intervention programs to aid early detection and treatment in schools along with mental health education. © 2025 Nutrition Society of Nigeria.

AB  - This chapter addresses challenges in school mental health education, such as insufficient follow-up interventions, inefficiencies in management processes, subjectivity in screening results, and data security concerns. We present the design and implementation of a Smart Mental Health Education System tailored for schools, developed through comprehensive stakeholder engagement. Focusing on the processes of “screening,” “following,” and “intervening,” the system features enriched early warning and intervention methods, enhanced student mental health records with intelligent archiving, professional course guidance, convenient access to screening data, and robust data security measures. Employing a grid-based management approach that integrates initial psychological evaluations, class advisor reports, and psychological counselor assessments, the system more precisely identifies at-risk students. A dynamic mental health archive enables automatic integration and cross-system data synchronization, improving record-keeping efficiency. Leveraging big data analytics, the system provides precise and efficient psychological training tools customized to individual student needs. Piloted in nine schools, including Hangzhou No. 2 High School, the system has enhanced the efficiency and effectiveness of mental health initiatives. Our innovations contribute to a more scientific and secure framework for school-based psychological crisis screening and intervention. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.

AB  - Background: Mental health issues among Canadian postsecondary students are prevalent. In tandem, an increased acknowledgment of the need for upstream mental health support has been highlighted. While the majority of institutions offer some form of mental health promotion, research suggests students are failing to access support due to barriers including lack of awareness, geographical and financial barriers, and lack of relevance in offerings. Canada’s Student Mental Health Network is a web-based knowledge mobilization initiative designed to fill these gaps. With content created and curated “for-students, by-students” and reviewed by subject matter experts, the Network serves as a one-stop shop for evidence-based, mental health support for postsecondary students. Objective: The goal of this research was to conduct the first component of a comprehensive program evaluation of the Network. This paper details a formative, process evaluation after approximately 1 year of operations, with the goal of assessing acceptability and feasibility. Methods: Using a concurrent mixed methods study design, quantitative and qualitative data were simultaneously collected from students in order to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of the Network as a mental health promotion resource. Quantitative data were automatically collected through Google Analytics via the website over the course of the first year of operations. Data collected included the number of users accessing the website, user engagement, and user “stickiness.” Quantitative data were used to evaluate both accessibility and feasibility. Qualitative data were collected via individual, digital interviews conducted with a modest sample of students (n=8) across areas and levels of study. Qualitative data derived more detailed insights into user experience and website attributes, as well as feedback on content delivery, providing evidence used to evaluate feasibility. Results: A total of 1200 users globally accessed the Network within the first year of operations, with Canadian users accounting for nearly 90% of total website traffic. An overall 66% engagement rate was observed, with the average user visiting 7 pages per session. Further support for the acceptability of the Network is demonstrated in the Canada-wide reach of the content development and review team. Evidence for the feasibility of the Network was observed through website use statistics indicating the most frequently viewed pages aligned with our goals: providing mental health education and increasing awareness of available resources. Qualitative feedback provided additional context surrounding the feasibility of the space, including positive feedback on the esthetics, relevance, usability, inclusion, and accessibility. Areas for content expansion and improvements to accessibility were also identified. Conclusions: The results of this study provide evidence in support of the feasibility and acceptability of the Network as a web-based knowledge mobilization initiative in support of postsecondary students’ mental health and well-being. Future research will pursue a summative, impact assessment to evaluate utility. © 2025 JMIR Publications Inc.. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adolescent mental health is a major public health concern in Iran, with 1 of every 5 adolescents suffering from a mental disorder. Mental health literacy (MHL) is an important factor in improving mental health outcomes. To address this issue, a mental health literacy school curriculum used in Canada was adapted, piloted, and evaluated for use in Iranian schools. This study examines the impact of the intervention on the attitude and help‑seeking intentions of first and secondary students in Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is semiexperimental research that was conducted on 200 female teenagers who were studying in girls’ secondary schools in Saveh, Central part of Iran, in 2023. The participants were divided into two groups, namely, the intervention group and the control group. Both groups completed a valid and reliable questionnaire that assessed their attitude and help‑seeking intention at two different time points. To evaluate the intervention’s effects, a repeated‑measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used. RESULTS: The study used the repeated‑measures ANOVA to assess the changes in the mean attitude and help‑seeking intention scores between the intervention and control groups. The findings indicated significant improvements in the attitude of help‑seeking (P < 0.001), informal help‑seeking intention (P < 0.001), and formal help‑seeking intention (P < 0.001) for the intervention group as compared to the control group during the study. CONCLUSION: The adapted mental health literacy school curriculum has been used and evaluated for the first time in Iran, and it has shown a significant increase in attitude and help‑seeking intention among first and secondary female students. These results need to be confirmed by further studies, which should also analyze the interrelationships between different dimensions of mental health knowledge and help‑seeking practices. Keywords for this study include mental health literacy, help‑seeking, attitude, and female students. © 2025 Journal of Education and Health Promotion | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.

AB  - Background: Mental health literacy among adolescents is crucial for the early recognition, management, and prevention of mental health issues. This study aimed to explore the knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs regarding mental health literacy among adolescents to identify gaps and inform targeted interventions. Methods: This qualitative study utilized semi-structured interviews to collect data from 29 adolescents aged 13-18 in Richmond Hill, Ontario, and was conducted between April and July 2023. Participants were selected through purposive sampling to ensure diversity. Data analysis was performed using NVivo software, and thematic analysis was employed to identify key themes and subthemes. Results: The analysis revealed three main themes: Knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs. The knowledge theme included categories, such as understanding of mental health, awareness of services, recognition of symptoms, sources of information, misconceptions, and mental health Education. The attitudes theme comprised stigma and stereotypes, willingness to seek help, perception of peer attitudes, the influence of media, role of family, and impact of cultural beliefs. The beliefs theme covered the causes of mental health issues, consequences of mental health issues, self-efficacy in managing mental health, effectiveness of treatment, and the role of community support. Conclusion: This study highlights the need for comprehensive and culturally sensitive mental health education programs to address misconceptions, reduce stigma, and enhance support systems. By fostering a supportive environment within families, schools, and communities, adolescents’ mental health literacy can be improved, promoting better mental health outcomes. © 2025 The Author(s);.

AB  - Background: Prevalences of mental disorders are increasing worldwide. However, many people with mental health problems do not receive adequate treatment. An important factor preventing individuals from seeking professional help is negative attitudes toward psychotherapeutic treatment. Although a positive shift in attitudes has been observed in recent years, there is still substantial stigma surrounding psychotherapeutic treatment. First studies have linked higher health literacy with more positive attitudes toward psychotherapy, but more research is needed in this area. Objective: This study aimed to examine how general and mental health literacy are associated with attitudes toward psychotherapeutic treatment in Germany. Additionally, associations between sociodemographic factors, experience with psychotherapy, and attitudes toward psychotherapy were explored. Methods: A random sample was drawn from a panel representative of the German-speaking population with internet access in Germany and invited to participate in the study via email. Overall, 2000 individuals aged ≥16 years completed the web-based survey with standardized questionnaires in September and October 2022. Attitudes toward psychotherapy and both general and mental health literacy were assessed using the Questionnaire on Attitudes Towards Psychotherapeutic Treatment (QAPT) with 2 subscales (“positive attitudes” and “non-acceptance of society”), the European Health Literacy Survey instrument (HLS-EU-Q16) and the Mental Health Literacy Tool for the Workplace (MHL-W-G). Associations between the questionnaire scales were assessed with Pearson correlations. Additionally, basic sociodemographic information and information on personal and family experiences with psychotherapy were collected. Pearson correlations (age), ANOVAs (level of education and subjective social status), and t tests (experience with psychotherapy, gender, and migration background) were used to analyze how these relate to attitudes toward psychotherapy. Results: More favorable attitudes toward psychotherapy and lower perceived societal nonacceptance were found in those with higher general (r=0.14, P<.001; r=−0.32, P<.001, respectively) and mental health literacy (r=0.18, P<.001; r=−0.23, P<.001, respectively). Participants with treatment experience for mental health problems (t<inf>1260.12</inf>=−10.40, P<.001, Cohen d=−0.49; t<inf>1050.95</inf>=3.06, P=.002, Cohen d=0.16) and who have relatives with treatment experience (t<inf>1912.06</inf>=−5.66, P<.001, Cohen d=−0.26; t<inf>1926</inf>=4.77, P<.001, Cohen d=0.22) reported more positive attitudes and higher perceived societal acceptance than those without treatment experience. In terms of sociodemographic differences, being a woman (t<inf>1992</inf>=−3.60, P<.001, Cohen d=−0.16), younger age (r=−0.11, P<.001), higher subjective social status (F<inf>2,1991</inf>=5.25, P=.005, η2=.005), and higher levels of education (F<inf>2,1983</inf>=22.27, P<.001, η2=.021) were associated with more positive attitudes toward psychotherapeutic treatment. Being a man (t<inf>1994</inf>=5.29, P<.001, Cohen d=0.24), younger age (r=−0.08, P<.001), and lower subjective social status (F<inf>2,1993</inf>=7.71, P<.001, η2=.008) were associated with higher perceived nonacceptance of psychotherapy. Conclusions: Positive associations between attitudes toward psychotherapy and both general and mental health literacy were delineated. Future studies should investigate whether targeted health literacy interventions directed at individuals with lower general and mental health literacy might also help to improve attitudes toward psychotherapeutic treatment and help-seeking behavior. © 2025 JMIR Publications Inc..

AB  - Purpose: Korean immigrant families are growing in the Southern United States (U.S), an area where culturally specific resources can be limited. Korean immigrant families encounter distress in navigating the American culture, but cultural stigma impedes discussion within the family. An evidence-based mental health awareness program called Youth Mental Health First Aid (YMHFA) exists to serve as gatekeeper training for lay adults to identify and support youth experiencing mental health challenges. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of a culturally adapted Korean-YMHFA (K-YMHFA) program among Korean immigrants in the Southern U.S. Materials and method: Using a mixed methods approach, a quantitative survey was distributed before and after program completion (N = 24), and a follow-up interview following program completion was also completed (N = 12). Quantitative analysis conducted a paired sample t-test, qualitative analysis conducted directed content analysis, and mixed methods analysis developed joint displays. Results: Participant’s mental health literacy, confidence and control in YMHFA skills, and positive attitude toward YMHFA skills significantly increased, and stigma decreased after the training. Participants also provided information on specific steps for increasing cultural relevancy and sustainability within the community. Overall, mixed methods analysis indicated that the program was feasible in the context of Korean immigrants in the Southern U.S. Conclusion: Despite the growing Korean community, the Southern U.S. has limited Korean ethnic services. With the feasibility of K-YMHFA, advocacy in promoting K-YMHFA is needed to counteract the limited resources while serving as an early intervention for youth and families in distress. © 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Context: Many adolescents report experiencing psychological distress, yet only a small percentage seek professional help. This discrepancy has significant implications, as delayed help-seeking can exacerbate issues such as social exclusion, academic struggles, and risky behaviors. Objectives: The study aimed to: (1) Identify factors influencing professional help-seeking behaviors among adolescents with psychological distress; (2) Evaluate the perceived importance of these factors from adolescents’ perspectives. (3) Determine socio-demographic predictors of barriers to help-seeking. Methods: This mixed-method study was conducted in two stages. In the first phase, participatory qualitative workshops were held with adolescents to generate a list of factors influencing help-seeking behaviors. These factors were then integrated into a quantitative survey disseminated among 210 high school students from a private urban school. The survey included: (1) A rating scale for the influence of 13 identified factors (e.g., parental support, societal judgment, autonomy needs); (2) Socio-demographic questions to identify potential predictors of obstacles to seeking help. The analysis employed descriptive statistics and linear regression to explore patterns and predictors. Results: The study identified 13 factors influencing help-seeking behaviors, such as: (1) Social and relational factors: Parental support, peer support, and confidentiality were the strongest encouraging factors. For example, 98% of participants reported parental support as a motivator for seeking professional help. (2) Mental health knowledge and attitudes: Knowledge of mental health and perceived utility of care were moderate motivators, though stigma and lack of confidence in health services remained barriers for some. (3) Individual psychological factors: Autonomy, self-esteem, and past experiences with mental health care presented mixed results, often acting as barriers. Socio-demographic predictors, such as gender, age, and proximity to mental health professionals, did not significantly correlate with barriers to help-seeking. Discussion: The findings align with existing literature, emphasizing the importance of stigma, social support, and mental health literacy. Interventions should focus on: (1) Reducing stigma and promoting mental health literacy.; (2) Enhancing adolescents’ autonomy and self-esteem; (3) Ensuring confidentiality in professional settings. Limitations: The sample was drawn from a private urban school, potentially limiting generalizability. Future research should explore diverse populations and employ implicit measures to minimize social desirability bias. Conclusion: This study underscores the complexity of help-seeking behaviors in adolescents, highlighting actionable factors to guide interventions. Parental support, confidentiality, and targeted educational efforts are key to fostering professional help-seeking among adolescents experiencing psychological distress. © 2025 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - Aim: To describe and evaluate the psychometric properties (reliability and construct validity) of the Mental Health Literacy and Stigma Scale-Bilingual (MHLaSS-B). Design: This is a methodological study designed in a convenience sample of 271 Portuguese and Spanish nursing students who volunteered to participate in the research. Methods: The Mental Health Literacy and Stigma Scale-Bilingual version (Spanish and Portuguese) was used for data collection. MHLaSS-B intercultural adaptation followed three stages: translation, back-translation and pilot test and the thinking-aloud techniques. Content validity was performed by Content Validity Index and Modified Kappa statistic. Construct validity and reliability tests were performed. Internal consistency was assessed by Cronbach's alpha. Data were analysed using SPSS programs. Ethics committee approval and permission from the institution involved were obtained. Results: The MHLaSS-B has 28 items of one-factor structure. Cronbach's alpha was 0.702. The cumulative variance explained was 23.14%. Respondents show High literacy and Low Stigma (M = 23.4). Patient or Public Contributions: The availability of the MHLaSS-B allows the general population of Portugal and Spain to have a versatile instrument for assessing stigma and MHL. The MHLaSS-B presents good psychometric properties, and it can be a useful tool for novice health workers to better understand the aspects they should pay attention to manage MHL and stigma successfully. The MHLaSS-B is a reliable, adaptable instrument that is now available and it can be used in investigation, teaching and clinical practice. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Introduction: Adolescent depression is prevalent, and teen suicide rates are on the rise locally. A systemic review to understand associated risk and protective factors is important to strengthen measures for the prevention and early detection of adolescent depression and suicide in Singapore. This systematic review aims to identify the factors associated with adolescent depression in Singapore. Methods: A systematic search on the following databases was performed on 21 May 2020: PubMed, EMBASE and PsycINFO. Full texts were reviewed for eligibility, and the included studies were appraised for quality using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. Narrative synthesis of the finalised articles was performed through thematic analysis. Results: In total, eight studies were included in this review. The four factors associated with adolescent depression identified were: (1) sociodemographic factors (gender, ethnicity); (2) psychological factors, including childhood maltreatment exposure and psychological constructs (hope, optimism); (3) coexisting chronic medical conditions (asthma); and (4) lifestyle factors (sleep inadequacy, excessive internet use and pathological gaming). Conclusion: The identified factors were largely similar to those reported in the global literature, except for sleep inadequacy along with conspicuously absent factors such as academic stress and strict parenting, which should prompt further research in these areas. Further research should focus on current and prospective interventions to improve mental health literacy, targeting sleep duration, internet use and gaming, and mitigating the risk of depression in patients with chronic disease in the primary care and community setting. © 2025 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

AB  - Background: School-based mental health services, particularly when integrated into multi-tiered systems of support (MTSS), offer an evidence-based strategy for primary and secondary prevention and targeted intervention for students’ mental health challenges. Team-based decision-making is at the center of successful MTSS, but the mental health literacy of school staff on these teams is unknown. Purpose: The current study aims to describe the state of MTSS team members’ mental health literacy and evaluate how mental health literacy components are related to one another. Methods: We measured the mental health literacy of MTSS team members (N = 58; 59% White; 92% female) from nine elementary schools, including their understanding of students’ mental health in the school context and their willingness to promote it. Results: MTSS team members reported more positive than negative mental health literacy, and mental health literacy constructs were predictably and positively interrelated. Discussion: Overall, the group appeared to favor approaches aligned with school-based mental health and social, emotional, and behavioral MTSS. Future research should replicate study results with a larger sample in order to increase the precision of the estimates and confirm the pattern of findings. Translation to Health Education Practice: MTSS team members typically demonstrate an understanding of students’ underlying mental health needs in the context of school and a personal and organizational willingness to address those needs. Staff training and system-level changes would likely further improve mental health literacy, with anticipated positive impacts on school-based mental health and MTSS outcomes. © 2024 SHAPE America.

AB  - Financial, environmental, and socio-cultural challenges affect the mental health and wellbeing of those working and living on-farm. Education programs can help in improving mental health and overall wellbeing, but most of these programs are offered to established farmers in a face-to-face format, leading to a gap in offerings to many subgroups, including young agricultural entrants. To address these gaps, this paper assesses the value of an online mental health and resilience education program for young agricultural entrants. An explanatory sequential mixed methods approach was applied. Firstly, a quantitative survey was conducted with 172 first year agricultural tertiary students, aged 18–20, to assess the knowledge and skills gained due to program participation. Regressions and propensity score matching were used to determine the effect of program participation. Subsequently, seven interviews were conducted with program participants to provide insights into their experiences of the program. Thematic coding was applied to analyze the qualitative data. Findings from the quantitative survey show a significant increase in mental health knowledge and skills amongst program participants compared to participants in the control group. The qualitative interviews show the ability to work through the material in their own time and space, creates a safe environment for online students. Other mechanisms contributing to learning are using “normal language”, a peer voice in communicating wellbeing, and building on learnings in previous education. This paper addresses a gap in literature by being the first study to evaluate online mental health education for agricultural tertiary students. It provides educators and other program designers with valuable information for future program design to support the wellbeing of young agricultural workers. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Objectives: This exploratory study aims to: 1) evaluate mental health stigma levels among agricultural youth directors, 2) examine the influence of professional characteristics on stigma, and 3) investigate the relationship between agricultural youth directors’ stigma levels and their self-efficacy. Methods: An online survey was administered from March to May 2022 to 642 agricultural youth directors in Illinois who work with youth aged 1–19. Directors’ personal and perceived stigmas toward mental illness were measured using the Depression Stigma Scale. Directors’ self-efficacy (perceived level of knowledge and confidence) across 19 mental health topics was measured using a 3-point Likert scale. Analyses were conducted by generating descriptive statistics and performing Mann–Whitney U tests on the data. Results: The median personal depression stigma score was 7.57 (SD = 8.02). Our analyses identified significantly higher personal depression stigma scores among men, FFA advisors, agricultural educators, and those lacking personal experience with mental illness. A lack of self-efficacy correlated significantly with increased personal stigma. Conclusions: This study underscores the critical need for targeted educational interventions to reduce stigma among agricultural youth directors and enchance mental health literacy. Anti-stigma and mental health literacy initiatives are essential for fostering a supportive environment that encourages open discussions about mental health issues with youth within the agricultural community. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - To improve school-based mental health literacy programs, we assessed adolescents’ familiarity with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We investigated the frequency of their contact with AD and their knowledge of the disorder. This comparative international randomized prospective study involved high school-based samples from eight countries (sample type: simple random; sampling unit: school/class). The questionnaire checked the contacts with persons with AD and had 10 statements to be labeled as true or false. The study was carried out among randomly selected 14,000 students from 2019 to 2023; 3,608 students indicated a lack of knowledge about AD (total n = 17,608). About 52% of the participants (n = 7,287) contacted persons with AD. With a maximum score of 10, the average score was 6.2 ± 0.9. The scores varied from 5.2 (Kazakhstan) to 7.0 (Australia). If the whole cohort of 17,608 students is analyzed, the average score was 5.1 ± 1.2 and varied from 3.6 for Kazakhstan to 6.1 for Australia. These scores declined from 2019–20 to 2023–24 school years. Although high school students had some knowledge about AD, existing educational programs may be amended to improve knowledge about the disorder, which may include information about the epidemiology, the possibility for early onset, and the female sex as a risk factor. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Objective: We aim to examine: (a) the extent to which patterns of adoption of counseling services and digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) shifted in recent years (2019–2021); (b) the impact of distress on adoption of mental health support; and (c) reasons related to adolescents’ low adoption of DMHIs when experiencing distress. Methods: Data were from three cohorts of adolescents aged 12–17 years (n = 847 in 2019; n = 1,365 in 2020; n = 1,169 in 2021) recruited as part of the California Health Interview Survey. We estimated logistic regression models to examine the likelihood of using mental health support as a function of psychological distress, sociodemographic characteristics, and cohorts. We also analyzed adolescents’ self-reported reasons for not trying DMHIs as a function of distress. Results: The proportion of adolescents reporting elevated psychological distress (∼50%) was higher than those adopting counseling services (<20%) or DMHIs (<10%). A higher level of distress was associated with a greater likelihood of receiving counseling (OR = 1.15), and using DMHIs to connect with a professional (Odds ratio (OR) = 1.11) and for self-help (OR = 1.17). Among those experiencing high distress, adolescents’ top reason for not adopting an online tool was a lack of perceived need (19.2%). Conclusion: Adolescents’ main barriers to DMHI adoption included a lack of perceived need, which may be explained by a lack of mental health literacy. Thoughtful marketing and dissemination efforts are needed to increase mental health awareness and normalize adoption of counseling services and DMHIs. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - LGBTQA+ young people experience suicidal thoughts and behaviors at a much greater rate than their heterosexual and cisgender peers. This study explored firsthand accounts of the coping strategies employed by LGBTQA+ young people when experiencing suicidal thoughts and behaviors. LGBTQA+ young people (N = 27; ages 14–25) in Australia with a history of suicidal thoughts and/or attempts participated in semi-structured interviews. Using reflexive thematic analysis, four major themes were developed: (1) It’s about the journey, not the destination, (2) Connecting with others, (3) When I knew better, I coped better, and (4) Doing the best I can with what I have. LGBTQA+ young people reported utilizing a range of coping strategies, however these were limited by a lack of knowledge around mental health, gender and sexuality diversity, and available resources. Experiences of discrimination within support settings and limited access to clinicians with knowledge of sexuality and gender diversity were cited as significant barriers. Interventions to increase mental health literacy in LGBTQA+ young people and improvements to clinician knowledge of sexuality and gender diversity are needed to enhance LGBTQA+ young people’s access to effective coping strategies when experiencing suicidal thoughts and behaviors. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - With rapid development and modernization of today’s society, the resource inequality between rural and urban areas has enlarged, especially regarding adolescents’ mental health education. In order to provide alternative to adolescents with limited resources, this study targets test anxiety as example, aiming to explore the effectiveness of online mindfulness training in alleviating students’ test anxiety through a quasi-experiment. This study recruited youths from 12 to 18 years old and used their pre-test/post-test data on 186 trained participants (M<inf>age</inf> = 14.85, 57.5% male) and 217 propensity-score matched controls (M<inf>age</inf> = 15.35, 53% male). After careful analysis, the results proved the effectiveness of online mindfulness training in reducing test anxiety and showed that the online training was more beneficial for students with serious interpersonal problems. This study further provided implications for the use of technology in mental health education, promoting the care of psychological well-being in rural areas. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - This paper examines the official pedagogic discourse communicating the explicit inclusion of Mental Health (MH) education in Singapore’s revised 2021 Character and Citizenship (CCE2021) curriculum within Singapore’s state-driven educational context of decentralised centralism. By adapting Basil Bernstein’s theoretical work on pedagogic discourse–using William Tyler’s typology of Bernstein’s ‘Pedagogic Codes’ and ‘Official Pedagogic Identities’–our findings reveal how MH in CCE2021 projects different, simultaneous student identities. These include retrospective identities of students as resilient, community-minded citizens; prospective identities of students as vulnerable cyber users requiring explicit guidance for their future-readiness; de-centred therapeutic identities of students as reflective, self-actualising students requiring psychological safety; and de-centred market identities of students as trained advocates and community first responders. Together, they generate a tension where therapeutic identities are positioned as prerequisite to the other identities, subsuming individual well-being within community well-being, and conflating the intrinsic good of personal resilience with instrumental notions of future-readiness. This expresses a paradox where state-student social relations are both transformed and continued, as concerns of student confidentiality and efficacy of help-seeking efforts persist. Overall, we contend the educational reform of MH in CCE2021 accommodates rather than reconciles progressive concerns of youth mental health with neoliberal state imperatives. © 2023 Pedagogy, Culture & Society.

AB  - Introduction: Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) are increasingly used to support child and youth mental health, yet the scope and characteristics of universal (Tier 1) DMHIs remain poorly defined. Methods: This scoping review synthesized peer- reviewed studies of universal DMHIs delivered to children and youth aged 0–18 years. Results: Use of online programs and hybrid delivery were prevalent. Many programs used an independent structure, while facilitation varied across self- led, facilitator-led, and both-led models. Outcomes were commonly assessed across multiple domains, including emotional, behavioural, social, and cognitive outcomes. When single domains were examined, these most often focused on emotional outcomes such as anxiety and depression. Interventions frequently employed therapeutic approaches such as cognitive behavioural therapy and psychoeducation, with content emphasizing emotion regulation, coping and problem-solving skills, and mental health literacy. Structural features varied in length and number of sessions, and many included scaffolded self-managed elements such as messaging or check-ins. Early childhood was underrepresented, with limited reporting of child outcomes for ages 0–4. Equity considerations were also limited, as many studies did not report race or ethnicity and sex and gender reporting was often binary or unspecified. Youth involvement in intervention design or consultation was uncommon. Discussion: This review provides an overview of the current landscape and identifies key gaps, including limited equity considerations, the underrepresentation of early childhood development, and minimal youth involvement. Clearer reporting of delivery structure and facilitation, stronger demographic reporting, and component-focused evaluation can support equitable, developmentally responsive scale-up.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the prevalence and associated factors of depressive symptoms among adolescents in Can Tho City, Vietnam. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 1,054 students aged 15 to 18 recruited from eight high schools using one-off anonymous questionnaires. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale Revised - Vietnamese version (CESDR-V). The Self-esteem Scale of Vietnamese Adolescents (EVES), the Crandell Cognitions Inventory-Short form (CCI-SF) scale, the School Connectedness Scale (SCS), and the Educational Stress Scale for Adolescents (ESSA) were used to assess self-esteem, cognitive distortion, school connectedness, and educational stress, respectively. Univariate analyses explored the relationships between sociodemographic variables and depressive symptoms. Pearson correlations were calculated for the associations between variables. Multiple regression was used to adjust for the factors that contributed to depressive symptoms in adolescents. The findings revealed that 37.4% of adolescents in Can Tho City, Vietnam, experienced depressive symptoms. Factors influencing depression in adolescents include cognitive distortions, academic pressure, exposure to interpersonal violence, consumption of alcohol and smoking, family history of depression, family incarceration, and experiences of digital sexual violence. These results underscore the urgent need for a multi-level and multi-dimension intervention strategy involving parents, educators, mental health professionals, and policymakers to promote early identification, provide support, and enhance mental health literacy among adolescents. © The Author(s), 2025.

AB  - Background: Chinese adolescents are navigating a complex digital environment amidst a growing mental health crisis. While health literacy is recognized as protective, previous research has primarily examined eHealth literacy (eHL) and mental health literacy (MHL) in isolation, leaving their synergistic effects and the integrative mechanism of mental eHealth literacy (MeHL) on social media addiction (SMA) and depression-anxiety-stress (DASS) largely unexplored. Objective: This study aimed to investigate how eHL and MHL work through MeHL to reduce SMA and DASS in adolescents. We specifically tested whether having stronger MHL makes an adolescent's eHL more effective at building their overall MeHL. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 855 high school students (mean age 16.38, SD 0.86 years; 52.5%, 449/855 male) from 5 Chinese provinces, selected via stratified cluster random sampling. Participants completed validated scales for eHL, MHL, MeHL, SMA, and DASS. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) and Hayes' PROCESS macro (model 7) with cluster-robust SEs, controlling for age and gender. The significance of indirect and conditional effects was assessed using bias-corrected bootstrap CIs based on 5000 resamples. Results: The results revealed distinct pathways. SEM path analysis indicated that both eHL (β=–0.152, 95% CI –0.270 to –0.034; P=.01) and MHL (β=–0.261, 95% CI –0.360 to –0.162; P<.001) were negatively associated with SMA. In contrast, only MHL demonstrated a significant negative association with DASS (β=–0.590, 95% CI –0.647 to –0.533; P<.001), whereas the link from eHL was nonsignificant (β=–0.011, 95% CI –0.102 to 0.080; P=.81). Bootstrapping tests confirmed that MeHL served as a significant mediator, with significant indirect paths from both eHL (SMA: β=–0.062, 95% CI –0.125 to –0.010, P=.01; DASS: β=–0.037, 95% CI –0.072 to –0.009, P=.008) and MHL (SMA: β=–0.045, 95% CI –0.090 to –0.008, P=.01; DASS: β=–0.027, 95% CI –0.053 to –0.007, P=.007). A key finding was the significant interactive association of eHL and MHL with MeHL (β=0.067, 95% CI 0.010-0.124; P<.05). This moderated mediation was supported, as the protective indirect paths from eHL (via MeHL) to both SMA and DASS were significantly stronger at higher levels of MHL. Conclusions: Unlike previous research that examined them separately, this study shows that eHL and MHL work best when combined. We found that MHL acts like a catalyst; it enhances the value of digital skills, helping teenagers become more competent at finding, understanding, and using online MeHL support effectively. In practice, this means integrated intervention programs that teach digital skills and mental health knowledge together are likely to be much more effective in fighting SMA and reducing distress than teaching either one alone. ©Yuting Xu, Zuosong Chen.

AB  - Background: Schools are important settings for the promotion of health and well-being. Many health-related education programmes in schools in England, including those delivered in-house by school staff or by external providers, have been evaluated to demonstrate their impact and effectiveness. However, narrative and reflexive accounts of researchers’ experiences coordinating and conducting evaluations of such programmes are limited. Methods: Drawing on reflexive research journals, we offer our reflections of qualitative data collection in primary and secondary schools in north-west England for the purpose of evaluating school-based health and mental health literacy programmes. Findings: This article explores two themes: (1) researcher identity and building relationships, and (2) the practicalities of qualitative data collection in schools in respect of time and space. Our account provides insight into the practical considerations researchers must remain mindful of when planning and generating qualitative data collection on general health and mental health and well-being issues in schools. Conclusion: Findings show that research in schools often requires considerable unseen time and effort on the researcher’s behalf. They suggest the need for more reflective and discursive writing on research processes to complement observations, findings and conclusions. Greater understanding of the realities of data collection in schools will likely improve the approaches adopted by researchers, especially those early in their careers. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Alcohol consumption, depression, and anxiety are conditions that have significant implications for individual well-being and public health both independently and together. Alcohol use disorders frequently co-occur with depression and anxiety disorders, with each condition exacerbating the severity and chronicity of the others. The bidirectional nature of these relationships suggests a cyclical pattern wherein alcohol misuse may serve as a maladaptive coping mechanism for individuals experiencing symptoms of depression and anxiety, while excessive alcohol consumption can precipitate or worsen these mental health conditions over time. Neurobiological mechanisms underpinning these associations include neurotransmitter system disruptions, alterations in stress response pathways, and structural changes in brain regions implicated in emotional regulation and reward processing. Moreover, psychosocial factors such as adverse childhood experiences, social isolation, and socioeconomic stressors contribute to the development and perpetuation of this comorbidity. Effective interventions for addressing these conditions include a multidimensional approach with pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and psychosocial support in the context of a chronic care model. Integrated treatment approach that simultaneously target substance use and mental health symptoms when there is a co-occurrence have demonstrated superior efficacy compared to standalone interventions. Preventive strategies should focus on early identification of individuals at heightened risk for developing alcohol-related mental health problems, as well as implementing policies aimed at reducing alcohol availability, promoting mental health literacy, and enhancing access to evidence-based treatment services. © 2025 Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents, highlighting the importance of early intervention in school settings. Universal mental health awareness programs, aimed at improving mental health literacy and help-seeking behaviors, are a key preventive approach. This study examined whether changes in thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness—two constructs from the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (IPTS)—mediate the effects of school-based mental health interventions on suicidal ideation (SI). A total of 436 adolescents from central Israel (154 boys, 279 girls; M = 14.6, SD = 1.1) were randomly assigned to either a mental health awareness intervention (N = 256) or a minimal-intervention control group with attendance monitoring (N = 180). Belongingness, burdensomeness, and SI were assessed at baseline, 1-month, and 1-year post-intervention. Regression analyses showed that lower belongingness (β = –0.25, p <.001) and higher burdensomeness (β = 0.21, p <.01) predicted higher SI at 1-month, while only belongingness remained significant at 1-year (β = –0.19, p <.01). The mental health awareness intervention increased school-specific belongingness (β = 0.22, p <.001), whereas attendance monitoring intervention increased general belongingness (β = 0.18, p <.01). Mediation analysis indicated that the effects of the intervention type on SI were not significantly mediated by general and school belongingness. These findings suggest that promoting broader social connectedness beyond school environments may support reductions in adolescent suicide risk over time. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Research following Hurricane Katrina highlights significant psychological impacts on youth, particularly posttraumatic stress, anxiety, and depression. While most children and adolescents demonstrate adaptability over time, the specific pathways to resilience remain less understood. This study explored longitudinal community data on disaster exposure and traumatic stress across the 10-year recovery period after Katrina. The dataset included 60,703 screenings of children and adolescents from 2005 and 2015 (N = 35,000). Children who met cutoff scores for clinically significant symptoms were compared over time. A series of logistic regressions were conducted to assess factors associated with cutoff scores each year. Results revealed a steady decline in posttraumatic stress: 45% of youth screened positive in 2005 compared to 23% in 2015. The most consistent contributors to elevated symptoms included loneliness, depression, anger, requests to speak with a counselor, and exposure to additional traumas. Other factors—such as property loss, relocation, housing displaced individuals, female gender, older age, and minority status—also contributed, though less strongly and consistently. Findings suggest that immediately after major disasters, roughly half of children experience elevated posttraumatic stress. By the 5-year mark, rates begin to approximate general population concerns (about 25%), with approximately 10% continuing to experience severe or persistent symptoms requiring clinical intervention. These findings underscore the importance of providing school-based mental health education on typical stress reactions and coping strategies, while targeting intensive clinical services for the smaller group with long-term needs. Importantly, youth in this study demonstrated remarkable resilience, offering valuable lessons to guide responses in future disasters. © 2025 American Psychological Association

AB  - Introduction: Given that medication is often utilised to treat mental health conditions, pharmacists across sectors are well placed to provide enhanced care to patients beyond their knowledge of medicines. However, this requires pharmacists to be appropriately educated about mental health. This study explores the priorities of pharmacy students for learning about mental health. Aim: This study aimed to explore the ideas and priorities of fourth year pharmacy students for mental health education under the following categories: (1) Content to be included. (2) What knowledge, skills and attitudes students wish to develop. (3) The teaching and learning approaches associated with developing these knowledge, skills and attitudes. Method: An exploratory case study design was conducted in 2024 within an elective ‘Education and Training’ module for undergraduate pharmacy students in Ireland. Eighteen students participated in the study and engaged in three different focus groups. The study was designed with student partners who supported the facilitation of focus groups and analysis of the data. Data analysis was conducted using thematic analysis on Nvivo software with a student partner. Final themes were agreed with the wider research team. Results: Four main themes emerged from thematic analysis of focus group transcripts: (1) the pharmacist and pharmacy as a safe space, (2) adaptable communication skills, (3) integration of physical and mental health challenges across curricula, and (4) seeking authenticity in teaching and learning approaches. Students also gave insights into what makes a contact-based learning experience worthwhile for them, and expressed a desire for integration of patient and public involvement into education in order to create a more authentic learning experience. Conclusion: Pharmacy students find value in authentic learning methods, and appreciate when patients and patient groups are involved in education. Additionally, they see each other as an important learning resource and value small group work. These learning methods have been integrated into our mental health module in the form of patient speakers, simulation practice, and small group work activities. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Background: Mental health stigma remains a significant barrier to treatment and recovery, particularly among adolescents. This study explores perceived stigma in previously hospitalized adolescents, their perceptions of inpatient psychiatric care, and parental self-stigma. Methods: We employed a cross-sectional, mixed-methods design with 82 adolescents (n = 67 females), aged 12-17 years (M = 15.5, SD = 1.2) and their parents. Quantitative measures included the Adolescent’s Stigma Scale, Parents’ Self-Stigma Scale, and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Qualitative data were collected via open-ended questions and analyzed using content analysis. Results: Findings indicated notable perceived stigma, especially among older adolescents (15–17 years) and those two hospitalizations, with secrecy, self-stigma, and rejection associated with emotional and behavioural difficulties. Parental self-stigma correlated with child’s age and length of hospitalization, and inversely with adolescent secrecy. Qualitative findings revealed that hospitalization offered emotional support and opportunities for personal growth, yet also posed challenges to autonomy, social and educational stability, and psychological well-being. Conclusions: Findings highlight the need for flexible hospital policies, improved discharge communication, mental health literacy initiatives, and peer-support programs. Future research should examine cultural influences, stigma trajectories, and effective family-based interventions for adolescents. © The Author(s) 2025

AB  - Purpose: The DNP Collective is a structured faculty–Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) mentorship model developed to implement a large-scale quality improvement (QI) initiative aimed at reducing mental health disparities, enhancing early intervention skills, and strengthening doctoral nursing education. The initiative utilized Mental Health First Aid (MHFA), an evidence-based program that teaches participants to identify, understand, and respond to signs of mental illness and substance use disorders. Design: A QI design combined community-wide MHFA dissemination with structured faculty mentorship to ensure training fidelity, cultural adaptation, and reflective learning. Methods: Between 2022 and 2024, thirteen DNP students, certified as MHFA instructors, delivered MHFA training across Michigan communities. Participants completed pre- and post-training surveys using the Mental Health Literacy Scale (MHLS). Faculty mentors ensured fidelity and cultural relevance. Paired t-tests evaluated MHLS score changes, and chi-square analyses assessed categorical variables. Results: A total of 422 individuals received MHFA training, with 224 matched MHLS surveys. Mental health literacy significantly improved, with mean scores increasing from 130.6 to 137.7 (p <.001). The greatest gains were observed among underserved populations, particularly Hmong and immigrant participants with limited prior exposure to mental health education. Conclusions: Integrating MHFA with structured DNP mentorship improved community mental health literacy and strengthened student leadership and project rigor. This scalable model embeds health equity and public health impact within DNP education. Clinical Relevance: For community health nurses, these findings highlight the importance of nursing-led, culturally responsive interventions in promoting mental health literacy, early intervention, and stigma reduction across diverse populations. © 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Objective: The study aimed to assess the effectiveness of mental health literacy digital awareness campaign, on the levels of social discrimination against mental illness, willingness to seek professional psychological help, and intended future behaviors among high school students in Jordan. Methods: A one-group pre-test–post-test study design was used, involving 43 high school students. The intervention included posting podcast series and reels through private Facebook groups over 1 month. Results: The students demonstrated significantly lowered perception of social discrimination (ʌ = 0.35, p < .001), more intended future behaviors (ʌ = 0.08, p < .001), and increased willingness to seek help (ʌ = 0.84, p = .029) over time. The magnitude of these changes was large for social discrimination (Cohen's d = 1.34) and intended behaviors (d = 3.00), and small to medium for willingness to seek help (d = 0.42). Male students (M = 16.3, SD = 2.1) scored significantly lower in willingness to seek help (M = 18.4, SD = 2.6) than females. Those with prior psychological referrals had higher social discrimination (t = 2.47, p = .018). Conclusion: This study offers school mental health professionals a valuable tool to support high school students through accessible platforms like social media. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Objective: Adolescent depression has emerged as a significant public health concern globally, including in China, and grasping a better understanding of adolescents’ views on depression could help design more adapted policies. This study aims to assess the prevalence of depressive symptoms among adolescents and examine their knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) related to depression. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between September 23, 2024, and December 3, 2024, in primary and middle schools in Shuangliu District, Chengdu. Data were collected through self-administered questionnaires, which included demographic information, assessments of KAP regarding depression, and the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS). The possible attitude and practice scores ranged from 9 to 45, interpreted as negative (9-22), moderate (23-31), and positive (32-45). Results: A total of 541 valid questionnaires were analyzed. Of the respondents, 308 (56.93%) were female, and 109 (20.15%) were from single-parent households. SDS scores indicated that 18 participants (3.33%) exhibited depressive symptoms. The mean knowledge, attitude, practice, and SDS scores were 9.07±5.08 (possible range: 0-18), 33.37±4.28 (possible range: 9-45), 35.77±6.84 (possible range: 9-45), and 37.35±9.07, respectively. Mediation analysis showed that knowledge directly affected attitude (β = 0.128, P=0.019), attitude directly affected practice (β = 0.250, P=0.011), while SDS directly affected both attitude (β = -0.366, P=0.007) and practice (β = -0.637, P=0.008). Meanwhile, SDS has an indirect negative effect on practice (β = -0.090, P=0.005), and knowledge has an indirect positive effect on practice (β = 0.032, P=0.012). Conclusion: Adolescents in Chengdu had insufficient knowledge about depression while exhibiting positive attitudes and proactive practices, and most of them were without depressive symptoms. The study identified knowledge items that should be reinforced through educational interventions on adolescent depression. These findings emphasize the need for enhanced mental health education to improve adolescents’ understanding of depression, reinforce positive attitudes, and support proactive mental health practices. © © 2025 Jiang, Zhao, Zeng, Lei and Wang.

AB  - Given the ongoing youth mental health crisis amid limited resources, young people and their families need sustainable, low-cost school-based interventions to support their wellbeing and connect them to vital services. As a first developmental phase of a clinical trial to integrate innovative digital mental health intervention into high schools, we first sought to understand the lived experience of students and parents. This study used qualitative methods to analyze diverse high school student, young adult, and parent reports of accessing in-person school-based mental health supports and use of health-related apps. Two-thirds of young people reported using health-related apps with common use related to entertainment, fitness, and mental health. Further qualitative analysis regarding access identified themes around availability, experience with services, and normalizing mental health vs. stigma in schools. Findings suggest opportunities for digital interventions to increase mental health literacy and address stigma through psychoeducation. Digital health tools may support schools as an adjunct to in-person services in reaching under-resourced students in need. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - This study examined the impact of cross-level simulated learning experiences (SLEs) on graduate Clinical Mental Health Counseling and undergraduate psychology students. The cases used in the SLE were with identified clients and family members. Using a pre–post design, researchers measured changes in self-efficacy, perceptions of simulation, and interprofessional attitudes. Results showed significant improvements in self-efficacy, including problem-solving and emotional regulation. Students reported increased perceptions of simulation realism and value. Small to medium effect sizes indicated meaningful improvements, suggesting SLEs can effectively bridge theoretical knowledge and practical application in mental health education. © The Author(s) 2025

AB  - Despite calls for critical perspectives in mental health education, school-based approaches continue to lean heavily toward healthism, often with an overreliance on bio-medical approaches. In response, this research promotes improving criticality in school-based mental health education by examining the goals of mental health literacy in view of structural, ecological and social determinants of health. Drawing inspiration from the work of Barillas Chón et al. (2024) we adopt their methodology of writing critical love letters to express both appreciation and concern for current and future directions of the discipline. Through an examination of our professional connections to health education curriculum, we grapple with gaps in school-based mental health education, leading us to propose three additional goals for mental health literacy. The first goal encourages the use of counternarratives to understand how structural ideologies such as neoliberalism, patriarchy and colonialism impact mental health. The second turns a critical lens toward the Anthropocene, promoting the use of epistemological perspectives such as Indigenous pedagogies and environmental attunement to query how ecological factors contribute to inequities in mental health. The third new goal calls for challenging students to use high valence language to interrogate how living conditions impact populations that experience oppression. These new goals for mental health literacy offer additional pathways for promoting a critical socio-ecological approach in school-based mental health education, emphasizing criticality. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: In the community, there are non-forensic individuals who experience sexual interest in minors and have specific mental health needs and concerns. If left unaddressed, these issues may contribute to problematic sexual behaviors. Although supportive treatment programs are emerging in Czechia, self-motivated help-seeking remains generally low in this at-risk population. Objective: To inform strategies for encouraging preventive service use, this study aimed to examine how past help-seeking experiences relate to factors that may influence the likelihood of seeking professional help, as identified in the literature. Methods: An online survey was conducted with a purposive sample of 97 community-based, predominantly male, non-forensic adults whose responses to hypothetical scenarios suggested a sexual interest in minors. The study investigated the relationship between self-reported past formal help-seeking behavior (any vs. none) and two key variables: perceived urgency of self-identified concerns and dismissive attitudes toward professional assistance. Analyses controlled for other forms of support sought. Results: Formal support sources were rarely approached. A significant association was found between low perceived urgency of self-identified concerns and the absence of formal help-seeking behavior (β = 0.33, F(1) = 6.34, p = 0.014). Conclusion: To promote professional service uptake among this difficult-to-reach population, it is essential to enhance mental health literacy across the broader community and to educate individuals about the role of psychological well-being in preventing problematic behaviors. © © 2025 Martinec Nováková, Krejčová, Bártová, Androvičová and Klapilová.

AB  - Issues of mental health among higher vocational education students have attracted growing concern, fueling the need for novel pedagogical approaches that can foster psychological resilience. This study details the design and implementation of an innovative Virtual Reality (VR) pedagogical framework for mental health courses in higher vocational education settings. The research addresses the limitations of conventional pedagogical approaches through the use of immersive VR technology to create experiential learning spaces that foster the development of psychological resilience. Through a mixed-methods research design, we created an extensive VR-based curriculum with four main modules: stress management simulation, social interaction training, problem-solving under pressure, and exercises on emotional regulation. A 12 week experiment was carried out with 200 higher vocational students, comparing the effects of the VR intervention group with a control group receiving conventional instruction. Quantitative results revealed significant improvements in psychological resilience scores (Cohen’s d = 0.78, p < 0.001). Qualitative findings revealed significant improvements in student engagement, skill transfer to real-life situations, and self-efficacy in coping with psychological adversity. The virtual reality (VR) model showed greater educational efficacy in terms of knowledge retention, with a 23% improvement, as well as in practical skill application, which showed a 31% improvement compared to traditional learning methods. This study presents an empirically supported model for incorporating VR technology in mental health training, providing data-driven recommendations for its use in professional settings and opening the door for new approaches utilizing VR technology to enhance psychological resilience. © The Author(s) 2025

AB  - Purpose – This paper aims to evaluate the cultural appropriateness, readability and suitability of the school-based mental health curriculum, with the ultimate aim of promoting students’ mental health literacy. Design/methodology/approach – This research was conducted in two stages. The first stage involved a panel of experts evaluating the cultural appropriateness and adaptation of the mental health curriculum to Iranian culture. The second stage involved randomly selecting the first secondary schools in Sirjan and assessing the curriculum’s readability and suitability. Five mental health counselors and 25 students were included in the study. Findings – The results revealed that the cultural appropriateness and acceptability of the curriculum were verified following the implementation of cultural adjustments and reforms. The mean readability score for the mental health curriculum, measured by the readability of materials, was 13 before incorporating cultural appropriateness. After the inclusion of cultural appropriateness, the score improved to 16.5. Also, incorporating cultural appropriateness into the mental health curriculum increased the mean suitability of materials score from 62.7 to 87.2. Research limitations/implications – Following the cultural appropriateness, the mental health curriculum was considered a superior medium due to its high score in cultural appropriateness, suitability and readability of materials. Practical implications – Educational materials are recommended to be evaluated for appropriateness and readability before publication, and educational content should be tailored to the intended audience. Social implications – Utilizing this program in schools can serve as a beneficial and efficient method to enhance students’ mental health literacy. Originality/value – Education professionals should ensure that instructional materials are appropriate for the intended audience. © Emerald Publishing Limited

AB  - With the intensification of global ecological crises and the prominence of adolescent mental health issues, traditional disciplinary teaching models have proven inadequate for cultivating modern citizens equipped with ecological awareness and psychological literacy. This study, based on an interdisciplinary perspective, constructs an ecological psychology literacy cultivation model that integrates biology education with mental health education, aiming to explore innovative pathways for educational reform in the new era. Employing a mixed-methods research approach, the study developed a theoretical model of ecological psychology literacy encompassing four dimensions—Ecological cognition, ecological emotion, ecological behavior, and psychological adaptation—Through literature analysis and expert interviews, and developed corresponding assessment tools. Through a quasi-experimental study conducted over 18 months with 360 high school students, the scientific validity of the theoretical model was verified using statistical methods including exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and structural equation modeling. Results showed that the four-dimensional model demonstrated good reliability and validity. The interdisciplinary cultivation model significantly improved students' literacy levels (experimental group improved by 18.16%, with effect sizes d = 0.63-0.91). The intervention effect retention rate reached 98.1%, and environmental psychological factors influenced literacy development through dual pathways (total mediation effect of 78.5%). This research enriches interdisciplinary educational theory with new content, provides a scientific theoretical framework and practical guidance for ecological psychology literacy cultivation, and holds significant implications for promoting educational reform innovation and cultivating high-quality talents for the new era. © 2025 by author(s).

AB  - Clinical staging models are tools used in healthcare that have the potential to enhance diagnostic precision, improve treatment decisions, articulate more personalized care pathways, and optimize service models. In youth mental health, clinical staging has been increasingly applied to conditions where progression from non-specific symptoms to full-blown syndromes, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression, is possible. However, novel transdiagnostic staging models have also been proposed, recognizing the limitations of current classification systems and the substantial overlap of symptoms, particularly early in the illness course. Models incorporating an appropriate developmental and transdiagnostic lens may offer significant advances for research and clinical practice, supporting early intervention and secondary prevention. This narrative review critically examines theoretical premises and empirical applications of transdiagnostic clinical staging models in youth. Peer-reviewed studies were identified in PubMed using search terms related to clinical staging, focusing on sociodemographic, cognitive, and clinical factors investigated in youth samples (age 12-30 years). Evidence is synthesized in three main sections: progression, extension, and stage-based treatment. Additionally, a stage-based care model and directions for future research are presented. Early findings partially support important assumptions for the model, suggesting stage-related differences in cognition and functionality. Furthermore, new extension features have been recently proposed, including substance use, circadian disturbances, and physical illnesses. The long-term outcomes of stage-based interventions remain an open question. While the transdiagnostic clinical staging model offers a promising alternative for classifying youth psychopathology, further empirical validation is essential before its widespread implementation. © 2025, Associacao Brasileira de Psiquiatria.

AB  - Background: Adolescent mental health has become an increasingly urgent concern, particularly in the aftermath of the COVID- 19 pandemic. Mental Health Literacy (MHL) is emerging as a critical construct to promote psychological well-being, reduce stigma, and encourage the early recognition of psychological distress. Methods: This study presents baseline data from a school-based pilot initiative conducted in a secondary school in Southern Italy. The aim was to assess students’ knowledge beliefs, and attitudes toward mental health prior to implementing targeted educational interventions. A total of 85 fifth-year students (mean age = 17.7 years) completed the Italian version of the Mental Health Literacy Questionnaire – short form (MHLq-short), administered anonymously via an online platform. Statistical analyses included descriptive measures and non-parametric tests to explore the association between MHL scores and familiarity with mental health problems. Results: Students who reported knowing someone with mental health issues exhibited a trend toward higher mental health literacy scores. In contrast, those who reported no such exposure or expressed uncertainty demonstrated lower average ranks, possibly reflecting limited awareness or emotional disengagement. Conclusions: These findings highlight the potential role of personal experience in shaping mental health literacy and reinforce the need for structured, school-based interventions. To our knowledge, this study represents the first application of the MHLq-short in Italy and supports its feasibility in identifying literacy gaps among adolescents. Future initiatives could aim to replicate and scale this model across diverse educational settings and inform national strategies to integrate MHL into school curricula. © 2025, Medicinska Naklada Zagreb.

AB  - Background: While the existence of mental health stigma and its negative impact on help-seeking behavior is well documented in high-income countries and some low- and middle-income countries, studies examining mental health stigma among children and adolescents in schools in sub-Saharan Africa are limited. Hence, we examined mental health stigma among school-going children (ages 8 to 13) in Uganda. Methods: Baseline data from children (n = 100) in two public primary schools selected using convenience sampling were analyzed for the study. Mental health stigma was measured using social distance and attitudes about mental health scales. Descriptive statistics were used for item-by-item analysis, and independent sample t-tests were used to examine the relationship between age, gender, grade level, and social distance and attitudes about mental health. Results: Results showed moderate levels of positive attitudes about mental health (mean = 51.83, SD = 6.66) and willingness to interact with someone with mental illness (mean = 27.70, SD = 6.75). However, an item-by-item analysis revealed areas where mental health stigma, misconceptions, and a lower willingness to interact remained persistent. There were no significant differences in willingness to interact with people with mental illness (social distance) by age, gender, or grade level. However, there was a significant difference in attitudes about mental health by grade (t(96) = -2.67, p = 0.009), where upper primary students reported significantly more positive attitudes toward mental illness (M = 53.97, SD = 5.63) compared to lower primary students (M = 50.41, SD = 6.95). Conclusion: The results suggest that mental health literacy and stigma programs are needed in school settings in Uganda. The item-by-item analysis provides insights into tailoring school-based programs to address persistent misconceptions and stigmatizing attitudes. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - Background: Many adolescents face significant mental health challenges, including anxiety, depression, and substance-related and addictive disorders, with a growing need for school-based preventive strategies. Traditional classroom interventions often struggle to engage adolescents, prompting the exploration of game-based approaches to improve mental health knowledge and foster healthier attitudes. Objective: This systematic review evaluates the effectiveness of game-based interventions implemented in classroom settings to enhance mental health knowledge and promote positive attitudes among adolescents. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted across Medline, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and SCOPUS, yielding 1,152 articles. After screening, 17 studies were included, most using cluster randomized controlled trial designs. These interventions addressed topics of mental health such as substance-related and addictive disorders, anxiety, and depression, employing playful activities like video games, virtual reality simulations, quizzes, and collaborative tasks. Results: The interventions showed positive effects on knowledge acquisition and attitude change, with high satisfaction reported by participants. Those programs targeting alcohol and tobacco use were particularly effective in improving knowledge and attitudes. However, the quality of evidence varied, and long-term effects were not widely assessed due to a lack of follow-up in most studies. Some interventions had a limited impact on self-efficacy and behavior change. Conclusions: Game-based classroom interventions show promise in promoting mental health literacy and healthier attitudes among adolescents. While short-term outcomes are encouraging, more rigorous studies with extended follow-up periods are necessary to understand their long-term effectiveness. Future interventions should focus on practical skill development and personalization to maximize impact.

AB  - Objective: In order to support mental health help-seeking for Australian adolescents, it is imperative to understand and improve their mental health literacy (MHL). MHL measures are needed to identify MHL needs and to evaluate MHL interventions; however, a standardised MHL measure is yet to be validated for Australian adolescents. The current study aimed to validate the Universal Mental Health Literacy Scale for Adolescents (UMHL-A) with Australian adolescents. Method: Participants were recruited through a national recruitment company and included 402 Australian youth, 15 to 18 years old. First, the factor structure of the UMHL-A was evaluated through confirmatory factor analysis. Second, reliability was assessed through internal consistency and item-total score reliability. Finally, convergent and divergent validity were appraised. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis validated the structure of the UMHL-A with good fit indices for the four factors of help-seeking efficacy, stigma, knowledge of mental health, and knowledge of mental illness. Moreover, adequate reliability, convergent and divergent validity were demonstrated. Conclusion: This evaluation of the UMHL-A enables theoretically grounded and psychometrically validated measurement of MHL with Australian adolescents. The UMHL-A has widespread application in research and practice, for clinicians, schools, mental health services and government policies. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into health care, including psychiatry and psychology. In educational contexts, AI offers new possibilities for enhancing clinical reasoning, personalizing content delivery, and supporting professional development. Despite this emerging interest, a comprehensive understanding of how AI is currently used in mental health education, and the challenges associated with its adoption, remains limited. Objective: This scoping review aimed to identify and characterize current applications of AI in the teaching and learning of psychiatry and psychology. It also sought to document reported facilitators of and barriers to the integration of AI within educational contexts. Methods: A systematic search was conducted across 6 electronic databases (MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, EBM Reviews, and Google Scholar) from inception to October 2024. The review followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. Studies were included if they focused on psychiatry or psychology, described the use of an AI tool, and discussed at least 1 facilitator of or barrier to its use in education. Data were extracted on study characteristics, population, AI application, educational outcomes, facilitators, and barriers. Study quality was appraised using several design-appropriate tools. Results: From 6219 records, 10 (0.2%) studies met the inclusion criteria. Eight categories of AI applications were identified: clinical decision support, educational content creation, therapeutic tools and mental health monitoring, administrative and research assistance, natural language processing (NLP), program/policy development, students’ study aid, and professional development. Key facilitators included the availability of AI tools, positive learner attitudes, digital infrastructure, and time-saving features. Barriers included limited AI training, ethical concerns, lack of digital literacy, algorithmic opacity, and insufficient curricular integration. The overall methodological quality of included studies was moderate to high. Conclusions: AI is being used across a range of educational functions in psychiatry and psychology, from clinical training to assessment and administrative support. Although the potential for enhancing learning outcomes is clear, its successful integration requires addressing ethical, technical, and pedagogical barriers. Future efforts should focus on AI literacy, faculty development, and institutional policies to guide responsible and effective use. This review underscores the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration to ensure the safe, equitable, and meaningful adoption of AI in mental health education. ©Julien Prégent, Van-Han-Alex Chung, Inès El Adib, Marie Désilets, Alexandre Hudon.

AB  - With significant rates of mental health problems reported among adolescents in Pakistan, it is necessary to equip them with mental health knowledge for timely detection and intervention. This study investigated the effectiveness of the Urdu version of the Mental Health and High School Curriculum Guide in improving adolescents' mental health literacy. By utilizing quasi experimental research design, a total of 316 grade nine students from three government high schools in Lahore, Pakistan were screened on Urdu Version of Mental Health Literacy Scale. From these, 122 participants who scored low were divided into intervention group (n = 61) and waitlist control group (n = 61) while being matched on gender, age and school variables to limit confounding. A total of 78 students (intervention group; n = 42 and waitlist control group; n = 36) completed the intervention and post-evaluation. Independent Samples t-test revealed that the intervention group exhibited improved mental health literacy post-intervention than the waitlist control group (t [76] = 7.70, p < 0.001, Hedges' g = 1.94). The paired samples t-test indicated significant post-intervention improvements in the intervention group's mental health literacy (t [41] = −14.48, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 2.51), mental health knowledge (t [41] = −10.11, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 1.71), and attitudes (t [41] = −4.34, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.72). This study had an attrition rate of 35.2% and the differential attrition analysis revealed no significant differences between the participants who completed the study and those who dropped out. Overall, the present study highlights the effectiveness of the guide and underscores the need for policy makers to embed such programs in educational curriculum to prevent mental health disorders and enhance community outcomes. © 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Aims: Football Club Community Trusts (FCCTs) that are attached to professional football clubs in the UK use the sport brand to engage marginalised populations in various initiatives designed to address public health agendas. Studies highlight the impact that FCCTs can have on adults’ mental health, yet less is known about programmes for young people under 18 years. This study is the first to identify the mental health-focussed interventions for young people that are delivered by the FCCTs in the English Football League (EFL), including the key programme features and challenges to implementation. Methods: A 60-item mixed-method survey was sent to all 70 FCCTs in the EFL during the 2018–2019 season in September 2018. In total, 54 (77.1%) FCCTs responded. Results: In total, 21 FCCTs were delivering mental health-focused interventions to young people and 23 different initiatives were identified. Reported aims included promoting resilience (n = 19/21, 90.5%) and self-esteem (n = 19/21, 90.5%), as well as identifying young people at risk of developing a mental health problem (n = 9/21, 42.9%). However, features of individual programmes varied. Some used football to increase social inclusion and overall wellbeing, whereas others included education sessions to improve mental health literacy (e.g. anti-stigma, strategies to promote mental health). FCCTs also reported challenges with evaluating their own interventions, sustaining funding, and keeping up to date with mental health training. Conclusions: This study contributes to the limited literature on professional sport club community trust interventions, highlighting the value of programmes targeting children and young people’s mental health. FCCT programmes align with mental health promotion and prevention policy, by providing opportunities to participate in physical activity (PA), develop mental health literacy, and identify young people at risk of developing mental health problems. Collaboration with organisations with expertise in service evaluation, audit, and research is essential to support FCCTs in evaluating their impact and demonstrating the significance of their work. © Royal Society for Public Health 2025

AB  - Background: Asian American (AA) youth experience more mental health difficulties than their non-Asian peers. Suicide has been the leading cause of death among AA youth in the U.S. since 2016. Despite these alarming statistics, AA youth and adults are less likely to seek mental health services compared with other groups. Objective: To culturally adapt Youth Mental Health First Aid (YMHFA) training for AA parents following the Participatory Culture-Specific Consultation framework, and evaluate the effectiveness of the training. Method: Utilizing a quasi-experimental design with a control group, we recruited 137 AA parents (M<inf>age</inf> = 47.5, SD<inf>age</inf> = 6.67) with children aged 8 to 20, and placed them in the experimental group (n = 68) or the waitlist control group (n = 69) based on their preferred training dates. We assessed whether participants in the experimental group exhibited improvements in knowledge (mental health literacy), attitudes (attitudes toward seeking psychological services, help-seeking intentions, stigma, confidence in using Mental Health First Aid [MHFA] skills, and intentions to use MHFA skills), behavior (mental health service use, engaging in MHFA behaviors, and parent-child relationships), and perceived improvements in youth mental health compared to the waitlist control group. We also examined if these improvements persisted at the four-month follow-up. Results: Participants in the experimental group reported significant improvements in mental health service utilization, help-seeking intentions, confidence in using MHFA skills, intentions to engage in MHFA skills to support youth with depression, and reduced stigma, compared with the waitlist control group. These improvements were maintained at the four-month follow-up. No significant effect was found on attitudes toward help-seeking. Conclusions: The culturally adapted YMHFA training demonstrated promise in improving attitudes and mental health service utilization among AA parents. A randomized controlled trial design is needed to further evaluate the effectiveness of YMHFA training among AA parents. © 2025 Society of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology.

AB  - In recent times, global concerns about children’s mental health have captured the attention of politicians, scholars, the media, and public health organisations. As with other public health imperatives, schools are positioned as ‘obvious’ sites for solutions, including the use of outsourced teaching and learning programmes, curricula, and resources. In this paper I employ Foucault’s notion of governmentality to critically examine how rationalities of neoliberalism and healthism re-imagine mental health education as a form of mental healthism education in modern educational contexts. By using three mental health education programmes promoted to schools in the United Kingdom as an example, I critically examine how multiple rationalities are brought together in an endeavour to shape young people as responsible consumers of mental health, and simultaneously depoliticise the dual problems of children’s mental health and mental health education in schools. A ‘critical mental health education’ approach, however, holds possibilities for challenging dominant rationalities of mental healthism and the ‘neoliberal imaginary’ of commercialised mental health education programmes. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Digital interventions have shown promise in enhancing mental health literacy among young people (YP). Initially developed in Indonesia, the Improving Mental Health Literacy Among Young People in Indonesia (IMPeTUs) intervention is a co-produced digital application designed to improve mental health literacy and self-management of anxiety and depression in YP. This study aimed to co-adapt the IMPeTUs intervention with YP in the UK and evaluate the feasibility of conducting a future definitive trial in education and community settings. Methods: The study consisted of two phases. Phase 1 involved co-adapting the intervention through consultations with 49 stakeholders, including YP, parents, and professionals, using principles of experience-based co-design. ‘Co-adapting’ and ‘co-creating’ refer to collaborative modification and development of intervention content with stakeholders. Then, Phase 2 was a multi-site, cluster-randomized feasibility trial with a nested mixed-methods process evaluation conducted at two community sites (N = 19, 12 completing 4-week post-intervention data and 11 completing 3-month follow-up). The ‘nested process evaluation’ assessed acceptability and engagement alongside the trial. Results: In Phase 1, the digital intervention was co-adapted with stakeholders to include expanded customization options, UK-specific content, and a new chapter on resilience, healthy relationships and self-care to improve engagement and support mental health literacy. Phase 2 showed the application was well-received, with YP appreciating its relatable storylines and problem-solving focus. Recruitment challenges and lengthy questionnaires highlighted the need for improved partnerships with schools and streamlined data collection. Despite these issues, the usability of the core design was validated, and recommendations to enhance engagement, such as reducing text and adding interactive features, were identified. Exploratory analyses suggested potential improvements in mental health literacy and well-being, although these results require confirmation in a well-powered trial. Conclusion: This study highlights the feasibility of co-adapting and implementing digital interventions to improve mental health literacy among YP within community settings. Future work should focus on refining recruitment strategies for school environments, streamlining data collection, and enhancing engagement features to ensure scalability and effectiveness in large-scale evaluations. These findings lay the foundation for further development and rigorous digital mental health literacy intervention assessment.

AB  - Adolescent mental health challenges constitute an important global public health issue. Despite the rapid development of AI technology in various fields, its adoption in rural mental health remains constrained. The purpose of this study is to examine the factors that influence the adoption of AI chatbots for mental health education among rural Chinese secondary school students. Utilizing the UTAUT2 framework, we included Perceived Risk (PR) and Perceived Anthropomorphism (PA) to construct a theoretical model. A questionnaire survey of 317 rural adolescents was conducted, analyzed via SPSS and AMOS. Results showed PE, EE, SI, and PA positively correlated with BI; PR negatively correlated; HM had no effect. Grade level moderated specific paths. The study extends UTAUT2 to marginalized populations, filling a gap in AI-driven rural adolescent mental health interventions. © © 2025 Li, Liu, Wang and Deng.

AB  - Suicide is an urgent global public health issue. In Muslim countries, suicide stigma and a limited understanding of treatment options persists. Despite the strong evidence for treatment efficacy, public confidence in treatment remains low and individuals with suicidality are not expected to recover fully. Research examining beliefs on the treatability of suicidal behavior within Muslim majority or Muslim minority countries is scarce. This study examines attitudes and beliefs toward the treatability of suicide among the general population in Tajikistan. Using an experimental vignette research design (n = 351), this study explores Tajik people’s beliefs regarding the potential of treating individuals contemplating suicide, the capability of mental health professionals to treat those in such distress, and the likelihood for individuals to recover and resume a normal, productive life. Results demonstrate a significant relationship between mental health knowledge and attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help and treatability, and that there is an interaction effect between age and gender of vignette subject on treatability, with older adults being seen as less treatable than adults or adolescents. This is the first study to explore treatment beliefs about suicidality in Tajikistan and has important implications for mental health literacy and targeted interventions in the region. © 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: Childhood and adolescence are critical periods for mental health development, with a significant risk for mental disorders. The Chinese government has prioritized student health and well-being, encouraging policies to support youth mental health. However, challenges remain due to high technical demands and inter-departmental coordination. Methods: The “pathway through care” model connects hospitals, schools, communities, and families to collaboratively promote adolescent mental health. The model employs general screening, interviews, and intervention strategies at various levels, including mental health promotion and training for students, educators, and parents. The model’s operation is led by a tertiary care team in collaboration with school districts. Results: Since the implementation of the model in Chongqing, a large-scale screening of students has been conducted, with over 330,000 students screened and a significant number receiving face-to-face interviews with psychiatrists/psychologists. The model has facilitated the early identification of students at risk, appropriate referrals for care, and ongoing support within the school setting. It has also engaged parents and the wider community in addressing youth mental health needs. Conclusions: The “Hospital-School-Home-Community” integrated mental health service model has demonstrated success in improving child and youth mental health within the school setting in Chongqing. It has effectively linked education and health systems to address a full continuum of care. © © 2025 Hong, Zhang, Wei, Ai, Wang, Chen, Xu, Li, Greenshaw and Kuang.

AB  - Psychological first aid programs aim to train lay people to help others who are experiencing a mental health crisis or developing mental health problems. The current article introduces the new German psychological first aid training program HSN. The acronym HSN stands for “Helfen in Seelischer Not” (helping in mental distress) but also for the action chain “hear, speak, network.” The HSN program differs from other well-examined mental health first aid programs by (1) focusing primarily on emotions instead of disorders, (2) using a blended approach, combining face-to-face and online elements right from the start of the project and (3) a low-threshold approach with a course duration of two hours. Here we specify the HSN concept and report first results from a sample of 150 students. The participating students completed a self-report questionnaire before and after the course regarding their “confidence to help.” The program demonstrated good feasibility without any relevant side effects. On a descriptive level we observed an improvement of the averaged values of all questionnaire items after the course. These positive initial results merit the further development of HSN as a low-threshold psychological first aid program. © © 2025 Scheele, Appel, Rausch, Schecklmann, Klein, Staudinger, Schmidt, Kreuzer and Langguth.

AB  - The mental health needs of Southeast Asian American high school students are often overlooked, despite the significant challenges they face, including intergenerational trauma, stigma, and limited access to mental health resources. The authors conducted a phenomenological study to explore the lived experiences of Southeast Asian American high school students who participated in a culturally tailored mental health literacy intervention. Seven students participated with six identified as Hmong American and one identified as Chinese Vietnamese American. Thematic data analysis was used to explore and code the data. Through semistructured interviews with seven participants, this study identified five key themes: (a) improved mental health knowledge, (b) openness to talk about mental health, (c) empathy and perspective-taking, (d) helpseeking and coping, and (e) community and connection. Findings revealed that the mental health literacy intervention fostered improved mental health knowledge, reduced stigma, and strengthened participants’ confidence in seeking help for themselves and others. Additionally, participants reported a heightened sense of empathy and connection to their peers, highlighting the importance of culturally responsive approaches to mental health. We discuss limitations and implications for this understudied community. © 2025 American Psychological Association

AB  - In recent years, the landscape of higher education has seen a significant shift toward integrating ideological, moral, and mental health education. This paper explores the deep integration between mental health education and ideological and political teaching, proposing a holistic framework that promotes comprehensive student development. By embedding ideological and moral principles across all academic disciplines, this approach aims for “stealth education,” where ethical values are seamlessly integrated into everyday learning experiences. Leveraging digital platforms further enhances psychological support and tailors interventions to promote both ideological clarity and psychological resilience. The study adopts a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative surveys with qualitative case studies, to evaluate the effectiveness of integrated educational programs. Survey findings from a diverse sample of 1,200 students indicate high levels of confidence in understanding complex concepts, increased enthusiasm for learning, and positive impacts on psychological well-being. © 2025 IGI Global.

AB  - Aim: Mothers of children with intellectual disabilities are particularly vulnerable to mental distress due to demanding and exhausting caregiving. However, in the Arab world, they are seldom screened for depression because of limited diagnostic resources. Addressing the urgent need for brief and reliable screening tools, this study evaluated the psychometric properties of the Arabic version of the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) among 85 Saudi mothers. Design: A cross-sectional study. Methods: The construct, convergent, and divergent validity of the PHQ-2 was examined through a latent variable model (LVM), while its cutoff score was examined through receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results: The unidimensional PHQ-2 (item loadings > 0.7) was positively predicted by stress and negatively predicted by high mood and happiness, supporting its convergent and divergent validity. The PHQ-2 effectively predicted low mood, poor sleep quality, nightmares, high stress, low general physical health, and willingness to join a psychological support program (area under the curve [AUC] range = 0.72–0.84, p values < 0.001). The best balance between sensitivity and specificity was achieved at the PHQ-2 threshold ≥ 2.5, while the cutoff ≥ 3.5 demonstrated a higher positive predictive value (PPV) for all outcomes (range = 30.0–78.8 vs. 23.0–70.8). Conclusions: The PHQ-2 is a brief, valid tool, which at cutoffs ≥ 2.5 and ≥ 3.5 can reliably detect clinically significant depression and related psychological and physical adverse effects. Mothers scoring ≥ 3.5 may require a clinician-based examination for depression, and they may benefit from specific mental health literacy interventions. However, the results should be interpreted with caution given convenience sampling, a small sample size, and elevated distress levels in the current population. These limitations highlight the need to replicate the study with larger, randomly selected samples from more diverse populations. Implications for Practice: Nurses can efficiently screen for depression and its mental/physical sequelae, as well as monitor response to treatment using only two items. The study provided two well-interpreted cutoffs of the PHQ-2, with real-world implications for mental health screening in under-resourced settings. Reporting Method: The study adhered to STROBE guidelines. Patient or Public Contribution: No patient or public contribution. © © 2025 Amira Mohammed Ali et al.

AB  - This study comprises a process evaluation, examining the implementation of the athlete component of a sports-based mental health literacy intervention, Ahead of the Game (AOTG). We investigated the mechanisms driving intervention outcomes, as well as intended and unintended effects. Twenty-three adolescent males (ages 12–17) who had recently participated in Help Out a Mate and Your Path to Success were invited to partake in dyads (n = 4) or focus groups (n = 5). We used reflexive thematic analysis to analyse the data. Participants reported improvements in knowledge of depression and anxiety literacy, perceived importance of help-seeking, greater confidence to seek help and support peers experiencing mental health difficulties, alongside shifts in language, attitudes, and willingness to have conversations about mental health. Unintended outcomes included trickle-down effects; participants reported that the program benefitted those who did not engage with AOTG. Participants also described strengthened team cohesion through shared learning experiences and vulnerability. These findings highlight the need for evaluating brief mental-health literacy programs in sports settings, given that benefits may extend beyond intended effects of the program, whilst remaining acceptable, feasible, and sustainable. We suggest strategies and key takeaways to improve participation, engagement, and implementation of sports-based mental health literacy interventions. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Mental illness amongst adolescents and young adults is a significant public health concern globally, particularly in low- and middle-income countries like Nigeria, where mental health infrastructure is limited. Young Nigerians face pervasive stigma, inadequate mental health literacy and limited access to care, often influenced by spiritual and sociocultural factors. This study explores the lived experiences of adolescents and young adults with mental illness, focusing on how they navigate stigma, emotional distress and systemic barriers whilst leveraging coping mechanisms. Methods: Using an Interpretative Phenomenological Appraoch (IPA) approach, this longitudinal qualitative study examined the experiences of 16 participants aged 15–35 years diagnosed with mental illness. Participants were purposively sampled from a psychiatric hospital in southeastern Nigeria. Data were collected through semistructured, in-depth interviews over 9 months. Thematic analysis was employed to identify patterns and interpret the dynamic interplay between societal stigma, individual coping strategies and systemic challenges. Results: Five key themes emerged: (1) perceptions of mental illness as abnormality and shame; (2) emotional and social struggles, including loneliness, strained family relationships and fear of the future; (3) coping mechanisms such as reliance on family, spirituality and professional care; (4) stigma and discrimination, highlighting both internalised stigma and advocacy efforts; and (5) barriers to care, including accessibility issues and the need for youth-specific services. Participants reported evolving perceptions and coping strategies over time, facilitated by therapy, social support and community awareness initiatives. Conclusions: This study emphasises the complex interplay between stigma, resilience and systemic barriers in the mental health journeys of young Nigerians. Findings highlight the need for culturally sensitive interventions, family-focused psychoeducation, youth-specific services and community-integrated approaches to reduce stigma and enhance care. These insights provide actionable recommendations for improving mental health systems in resource-limited settings. © © 2025 Aaron Nwedu and Jude Ominyi.

AB  - Introduction: The decision to use psychological or psychiatric help is complex and depends on many interrelated factors. This study aimed to characterize self-reported help-seeking behavior in the event of mental disorders among adults in Poland. Methods: This questionnaire-based cross-sectional survey was carried out in March 2025 using computer-assisted web interviews (CAWI) among 1,114 adults in Poland. Quota-sampling method was used. Results: Most of the respondents (54.8%) declared that they would be able to recognize symptoms related to mental disorders on their own, and 50.7% declared that they would be able to recognize symptoms related to mental disorders in others and recognize people who require the help of a psychiatrist or psychologist. Over two-thirds of respondents (67.1%) declared that they know where to seek help if they experience mental disorders on their own and 61.4% declared that they know where to seek help if a child or teenager is experiencing mental disorders. Only 17.2% of respondents declared that enough activities are carried out in Poland to promote mental health and prevent mental disorders. In multivariable logistic regression, female gender, ever visit to a specialist due to mental disorders and a history of mental disorders in the close family were the most important factors associated (p < 0.05) with self-reported help-seeking behavior in the event of mental disorders. Conclusion: This study revealed significant gaps in self-reported help-seeking behavior in the event of mental disorders among adults in Poland. Public health interventions are needed to strengthen mental health literacy among adults in Poland, particularly concerning help-seeking behavior. © © 2025 Lewandowska, Jankowski, Gujski, Mularczyk-Tomczewska, Szulc and Silczuk.

AB  - Background: Mental health literacy (MHL) is essential for enhancing mental well-being and addressing mental health challenges. In China, MHL levels remain low, and studies on gender differences in MHL are limited. This study aims to explore gender-specific differences in MHL and their influencing factors among residents of Foshan City, China, to provide a theoretical basis for targeted mental health interventions. Methods: Data for this study were obtained from the 2022 Foshan City Residents’ Mental Health Survey. A comprehensive sample of 9,044 participants over 18 years old was included, collecting information on sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle habits, health-related factors, and MHL assessments. Chi-square (χ2) tests and independent samples t-tests were used to analyze gender differences in MHL. Additionally, multi-factor logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify factors influencing MHL across genders. Results: The overall MHL attainment rate was 8.46%. Male residents demonstrated a significantly lower attainment rate of 6.65%, compared to 10.14% among female residents. Across specific dimensions, including mental health knowledge, attitudes, and psychological skills, males consistently exhibited lower levels of MHL than females. Multi-factor logistic regression analysis identified protective factors for male MHL, including higher educational attainment, professional technical occupations, and retirement, while depression emerged as a significant risk factor. For females, protective factors included higher education, higher monthly household income, and engaging in exercise 3 to 5 times per week. Risk factors for females included being middle-aged or older and experiencing depression. Conclusion: The MHL levels among residents of Foshan City are relatively low, with notable gender differences, particularly with males exhibiting significantly lower levels compared to females. These findings highlight the ongoing necessity to enhance the dissemination and accessibility of mental health knowledge. When developing relevant policies as well as measures, it is imperative to take into account gender differences and implement tailored programs aimed at enhancing MHL among both male and female residents. © © 2025 Chu, Xie, Liu, Ou, Lan and Xie.

AB  - Background: Adolescent anxiety’s underlying mechanisms remain unclear, which undermines adolescents’ social functioning. This study examined the moderating role of mental health literacy in the relationship between adolescent anxiety and psychological vulnerability. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 1,591 middle and high school students through online questionnaires in January 2023 in Guizhou Province, China. The Psychological Vulnerability Scale, Mental Health Literacy Scale, and Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders were used to measure psychological vulnerability, mental health literacy, anxiety, and its five dimensions, including panic/somatic, generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, social phobia, and school phobia in adolescents, respectively. Results: Psychological vulnerability was significantly correlated with adolescent anxiety and its dimensions (p < 0.05). The moderating role of mental health literacy on the relationship between psychological vulnerability and adolescent anxiety was left marginally significant (p = 0.07). Furthermore, mental health literacy significantly weakened the relationship between psychological vulnerability and social phobia (p < 0.05). The upward trend of anxiety as psychological vulnerability increases among the high mental health literacy group was significantly slower than the low mental health literacy group. Conclusion: Those findings suggest educators should develop curriculum resources to strengthen the cultivation of mental health literacy among adolescents to promote adolescent mental health. © © 2025 Hu, Zhong, Chen, Chen, Cong and Xu.

AB  - Background: Inferiority complex is a common psychological disorder occurring in adolescents during their psychological development and the root cause of most psychological problems. However, inferiority complex in adolescents has rarely been examined in previous intervention studies. This practice-oriented study combined character strengths theory with group psychological counseling to examine adolescents with high inferiority complex scores. Methods: A survey was conducted on 512 adolescents selected using convenience sampling from three middle schools in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, to collect information regarding the degree and characteristics of their inferiority complex. Those with a high inferiority complex score were recruited for a grouped experiment, where the experiment group received group counseling grounded on character strengths theory. Results: The participants had a moderately high degree of inferiority complex (mean = 2.92). Significant differ-ences were observed in the total inferiority complex score across gender, left-behind experience, and academic performance (P < 0.05). After the intervention, the inferiority complex score of the experiment group was sig-nificantly lower than that of the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (P< 0.05). Conclusion: The intervention model constructed in this study effectively reduces inferiority complex in adoles-cents, providing a reference for exploring an effective approach to adolescent-targeted mental health education. © 2025 Wang et al.

AB  - Background: Nursing students experience disproportionately high rates of mental health challenges, underscoring the urgent need for innovative, scalable interventions. Web-based mindfulness programs, and more recently, neurofeedback-enhanced approaches, present potentially promising avenues for addressing this critical issue. Objective: This study aimed to explore the effectiveness of the neurofeedback-assisted online mindfulness intervention (NAOM) and the conventional online mindfulness intervention (COM) in reducing mental health symptoms among Chinese nursing students. Methods: A 3-armed randomized controlled trial was conducted among 147 nursing students in Beijing, China, using a 6-week web-based mindfulness program. Participants received NAOM, COM, or general mental health education across 6 weeks. Electroencephalogram and validated tools such as the Patient Health Questionnaire and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire were used to primarily assess symptoms of depression and anxiety at baseline, immediately after the intervention, and at 1 and 3 months after the intervention. Generalized estimating equations were used to evaluate the effects of intervention and time. Results: A total of 155 participants enrolled in the study, and 147 finished all assessments. Significant reductions in the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and fatigue were observed in the NAOM (mean difference [MD]=−3.330, Cohen d=0.926, P<.001; MD=−3.468, Cohen d=1.091, P<.001; MD=−2.620, Cohen d=0.743, P<.001, respectively) and the COM (MD=−1.875, Cohen d=0.490, P=.03; MD=−1.750, Cohen d=0.486, P=.02; MD=−2.229, Cohen d=0.629, P=.01, respectively) groups compared with the control group at postintervention assessment. Moreover, the NAOM group showed significantly better effects than the COM group in alleviating depressive symptoms (MD=−1.455; Cohen d=0.492; P=.04) and anxiety symptoms (MD=−1.718; Cohen d=0.670; P=.04) and improving the level of mindfulness (MD=−3.765; Cohen d=1.245; P<.001) at the postintervention assessment. However, no significant difference except for the anxiety symptoms was observed across the 3 groups at the 1- and 3-month follow-ups. Conclusions: This 6-week web-based mindfulness intervention, both conventional and neurofeedback-assisted, effectively alleviated mental health problems in the short term among nursing students. The addition of neurofeedback demonstrated greater short-term benefits; however, but these effects were not sustained over the long term. Future research should focus on long-term interventions using a more robust methodological approach. ©Shu Jing, Zhenwei Dai, Xiaoyang Liu, Xuelin Yang, Jinglei Cheng, Tianming Chen, Zihang Feng, Xin Liu, Fenghe Dong, You Xin, Zhuoyan Han, Haiyan Hu, Xiaoyou Su, Chen Wang.

AB  - Background: Adolescent mental illness contributes significantly to both the global and South African burden of mental health. Mental health literacy (MHL) promotes early recognition and intervention and consequently, determines mental health-promoting behaviours. We aimed to explore adolescent MHL and its intersection with help-seeking behaviour and gender in adolescents in the Western Cape. Method: The study instrument was a self-report survey/questionnaire. One hundred learners from public and independent schools in the Western Cape completed the survey. Results: There was a significant difference between first aid skills and help-seeking behaviours between the different genders. Specifically, girls were more prone to first aid skills and help-seeking behaviours than boys and other genders. Boys, on the other hand, were significantly more prone to using self-help strategies than girls and other genders. While gender differences were evident, these results are not sufficient to generalise to the larger population due to the limited sample. Conclusion: The results of this study are relevant to practitioners who wish to improve MHL and help-seeking behaviours among adolescents. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Introduction: Children and adolescents with disabilities face increased mental health challenges and lack of access to exercise. Olympic combat sports (OCS) such as judo, taekwondo, and others might encourage social engagement, self-control, and resilience. However, not much is known about their mental health impact on this population. Methods: Following PRISMA-P protocols (PROSPERO registration: CRD42023452489), we searched seven databases for randomized controlled trials or non-randomized trials that evaluated the impact of OCS on mental health in children and adolescents (5–18 years) with developmental or physical disabilities. The key findings fell into 11 domains across mental illness attitudes, social skills, and mental health literacy. We also extracted individual (e.g., age) and social (e.g., family participation) moderating factors. Rob 2.0 (randomized trials) and ROBINS-I (non-randomized trials) were used to measure the risk of bias. Results: Twelve studies (seven randomized, five controlled trials) conducted during 1975–2022, encompassing 436 participants (11.4 ± 2.8 years), were included. There were significant improvements (p < 0.05) in stereotypy, communication, social–emotional functioning, and executive function, with occasional improvements in self-esteem and stress management. Several experiments reported rapid hormonal changes (e.g., cortisol) immediately after OCS, particularly among adolescents. Family involvement and age emerged as potential moderators, with older children and adolescents with engaged carers likely to benefit even more. Discussions: Despite different study protocols, outcomes, and risk-of-bias thresholds, OCS interventions overwhelmingly seem to enhance mental health in children and adolescents with disabilities. More substantial, longer-term trials would be required to validate these findings, explain the processes, and evaluate safety. Programs based on OCS that address disabilities could provide broad pathways to physical activity and psychological development as part of a whole-person developmental model. Conclusion: This review indicates that OCS interventions have the potential to improve mental health outcomes for children and adolescents with disabilities by increasing social skills and executive functioning while better regulating stress. The diversity of samples and inadequate study designs necessitate additional high-quality research.

AB  - Introduction: Mental health in children is crucial for their growth, development, and academic achievement. The high prevalence of mental health disorders in children necessitates efforts to enhance parental knowledge via more accessible channels. This study aims to evaluate parental perceptions of children's mental health and assess the impact of online mental health education on parental knowledge. Methods: A quasi-experimental design using a single-group pre-test and post-test method was conducted with 52 participants. The intervention consisted of synchronouz mental health education delivered via an online meeting platform, with data collected through pre-and post-test evaluations using Google Forms. Results: 53.8% of parents were concerned about their child's mental health, yet 40.4% were unsure about their capacity to recognize symptoms, and 78.8% had never conducted early screening. The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test indicated no statistically significant difference in knowledge scores before and after the intervention (p=0.177). However, the mean score increased slightly from 6.71 (SD=1.05) in the pre-test to 6.98 (SD=1.29) in the post-test. The effect size (r =-0.64, 95% CI = [-0.91,-0.37]) shows an impact classified as moderate to large. Conclusion: While many parents are concerned for their children's mental health, many cannot recognize symptoms and have not undertaken early screening. Although statistical significance was not achieved, the observed effect size and knowledge improvement in specific individuals highlights online education's potential to enhance parental understanding of children's mental health. It is imperative to advance the exploration of interactive and adaptable learning strategies to maximize the effectiveness of educational interventions. © 2025, Muhammadiyah Palu University.

AB  - Adolescents often face significant school adaptation challenges during the school transition period, which may negatively affect their academic performance, emotional well-being, and long-term development. However, research on school adaptation interventions remains limited, especially in applying hope therapy within large-scale, curriculum-based models in the Chinese high school context. This study examined the empirical effects of an 8-week mental health intervention curriculum based on hope therapy in enhancing school adaptation with Chinese freshmen high school students. A pretest revealed that the natural stabilization time for freshmen school adaptation was the ninth week after enrollment. A subsequent formal intervention experiment used a pre- and post-test randomized group control design to divide 444 students into matched experimental and control groups. The experimental group participated in eight psychological intervention sessions based on hope therapy, and the control group received regular mental health lessons. Results showed that the experimental group’s hope level and school adaptation significantly increased after the intervention, not only exceeding those of the pre-intervention level, but also significantly higher than those of the control group. Cross-lagged modeling results further revealed that hope levels at earlier time points significantly predicted subsequent school adaptation, while the reverse effect was not significant. These results collectively support the validity and applicability of hope therapy in improving adolescents’ school adaptation, and provides innovative and alternative intervention perspectives and practice guidelines for high school mental health education, with a strong focus on raising youths’ hope to develop meaningful lives. © © 2025 Deng, Yang, Li, Wei and Li.

AB  - Objectives: Enhancing mental health literacy (MHL) through school-based education intervention may encourage mental health promotion, prevention, and care and reduce stigma in adolescents. Over the last few decades, this has been a major area of interest for researchers and health planners. This study aims to explore the relationship between knowledge and attitude to mental disorders with students’ MHL. Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in 2023 in Sirjan. The statistical population included all the students of the first secondary schools selected through a multistage cluster random sampling method. The study ultimately involved 562 male and female students. Data were gathered through a MHL questionnaire, Mental Health Knowledge Questionnaire (MHKQ), and Attitudes to Mental Illness Questionnaire (AMIQ) along with a demographic information checklist. SPSS and AMOS Version 26 software were used in the statistical analysis. Results: The findings showed that mental health knowledge has a direct (0.15) and indirect (0.36) effect on MHL (p > 0.001). MHL has a direct and significant effect on knowledge of risk factors and causes (0.28), knowledge of self-treatment (0.15), knowledge of professional help available (0.33), and knowledge of where to seek information (0.61). Moreover, MHL had a direct and inverse effect on appropriate help-seeking behavior (−0.98). Conclusion: This study found that individuals with greater MHL exhibit more appropriate behavior and knowledge regarding mental illness or disorders. Thus, it is recommended that mental health be emphasized in educational programs to help students tackle the daily challenges of adolescence. © © 2025 Batool Zeidabadi et al.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore mental health literacy among youths with a background as asylum-seekers and refugees including the role of mental health literacy as a barrier to their service use. A systematic literature study was conducted to gain an overview of mental health literacy in youths with a background as asylum-seekers and refugees. The databases MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Web of Science were used to identify relevant research. The PRISMA statement was used to report on the literature search, and a thematic synthesis was used to analyze the data from the included studies. Eleven studies reporting qualitative data were included. The understanding of mental health varied. Some youths understood mental health and mental health problems as connected to body and mind, whereas others linked it to their life situation or attributed it to supernatural or religious causes. Help-seeking behavior also varied, with youths seeking support in ways they found helpful, such as through prayer, or talking to an Imam or priest, or confiding in friends and family. Professionals were often perceived as unhelpful, partly due to lack of cultural competency. Youths expressed mistrust of professionals, feeling that they focused too much on their past rather than addressing their present and future concerns. Moreover, mental health stigma was a significant barrier to seeking help. Different understandings of mental health among youths with a background as asylum-seekers and refugees influence their help-seeking behaviors. The current conceptual framework of mental health literacy does not address cultural and contextual factors. Mental health literacy should be further developed as a concept to encompass diverse perspectives. Professionals should be trained with a more holistic approach that considers cultural factors and user experiences, guiding the development of mental health literacy programs and services. © © 2025 Sandsgård-Hilmarsen, Ree, Salamonsen and Viksveen.

AB  - Graduate mental health education integrates theory with experiential learning to prepare students for clinical challenges. Practicums and internships at advanced levels are vital for skill development. Emerging technologies like virtual reality (VR) and simulation platforms enhance experiential learning, bridging classroom theory with practice. These tools improve learning outcomes and skill retention but face challenges such as high costs, resistance, and faculty training needs. This commentary examines barriers and proposes solutions for incorporating technology to strengthen experiential learning and evidence-based practice (EBP). It highlights how innovations develop critical thinking and evidence-based decision-making, equipping graduates to deliver quality mental health care. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - Background: Panic disorder is an anxiety disorder marked by severe fear of panic attacks in the absence of causes. Agoraphobia is a related anxiety disorder, which involves fear and avoidance of specific situations in which escape or help may be difficult. Both can be debilitating and impair well-being. One treatment option may be internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT), which allows large-scale application and may overcome treatment barriers for some individuals. Objective: This study aimed to evaluated the effectiveness of a novel online self-help intervention for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. As our primary hypotheses, we expected the intervention to improve panic and agoraphobia symptoms and well-being. Our secondary hypotheses entailed improvements in daily functioning, mental health literacy, working ability, and health care use in the intervention group. Methods: German-speaking patients (N=156) aged 18-65 years with internet access and a diagnosis of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia were recruited for this randomized controlled trial. The intervention group (n=82) received access to a 12-week online self-help program entailing psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring, exposure, and mindfulness elements. The control group (n=72) received care as usual during the study period and was offered the prospect of using the program after 12 weeks. The primary outcomes were assessed via the Panic and Agoraphobia Scale (PAS) and the WHO (World Health Organization)-5 Well-Being Index (WHO-5). Mixed effect models were computed using multivariate imputation by chained equation for the analysis of intervention effects. Results: In the intervention group, participants completed on average 7.3 out of 12 (60.8%) modules, and 27 out of 82 (32.1%) participants finished the whole course. Changes in PAS revealed a significant effect in favor of the intervention group (t<inf>110.1</inf>=–2.22, P<inf>adj</inf>=.03) with a small to moderate effect size (d=–0.37, 95% CI –0.70 to –0.04). No significant effect was found for the second primary outcome WHO-5 (t<inf>149.8</inf>=1.35, P<inf>adj</inf>=.09) or the secondary outcomes. Improvements were observed in anxiety (t<inf>206.8</inf>=–4.12; P<.001; Cohen d=–0.60, 95% CI –0.089 to –0.32) and depression (t<inf>257.4</inf>=–3.20; P<.001; Cohen d=–0.41 95% CI –0.66 to –0.16). No negative effects were associated with the intervention (t<inf>125</inf>=–1.14, P=.26). Conclusions: The presented online intervention can help reduce the core symptomatology of panic disorder and agoraphobia, as well as anxiety symptoms and associated depression. No effects were found for well-being and secondary outcomes. This may be due to higher illness burden in the intervention group and possibly the COVID pandemic, which caused unique challenges to patients suffering from panic disorder. Therefore, further research and intervention adaptations may be warranted to improve these outcomes. ©Christopher Lalk, Teresa Väth, Sofie Hanraths, Luise Pruessner, Christina Timm, Steffen Hartmann, Sven Barnow, Julian Rubel.

AB  - Introduction: Medical students face a high prevalence of mental disorders, such as depression, alongside inadequate mental health literacy (MHL). This study investigates the feasibility, and efficacy of an interactive, gamified educational program in improving participants’ MHL. Method: Thirty-two Iranian medical students participated in a semi-experimental pretest-post-test study. An 18-hour online program, delivered using the flipped classroom method, focused on mental health first aid, stigma, stress management, and subjective well-being (SWB) skills. Participants were evaluated before, after, and four months post-program using the Mental Health Literacy Scale (MHLS), Mental Health Promoting Knowledge (MHPK), and World Health Organization-5 Well-being Index (WHO-5). Results: Participants' mean age was 22.78 ( ± 4.54). Post-test results showed significant improvement in MHLS and MHPK scores (P-values< 0.05), which were sustained at the four-month follow-up (P-values>0.01). SWB improved in the post-test evaluation (P-value= 0.058). Conclusion: The educational program effectively improved medical undergraduates’ MHL and SWB. Given the rising concerns about medical students’ mental health, implementing such curricula appears promising for long-term benefits. © © 2025 Jabari, Eslami, Jalali Nadoushan, Goharinezhad, Tavallaei, Khodadoust and Mahmoodi.

AB  - Lived experience education occupies an increasingly important space in mental health education for social workers. Despite being plagued by practices that continue to be discriminating and exclusionary, the mental health policy and practice context demand robust attention to the meaningful inclusion of service users and their families to achieve genuine partnership, reciprocity, and equality in mental health service provision. For social work educators, lived experience education is now an indispensable component of a critically informed mental health curriculum and pedagogy. Framed within an appeal for epistemic justice, this article reports on qualitative survey data from social work students who experienced teaching from people with lived experience. Findings show that students greatly valued lived experience education, as it created opportunities for authentic and more diverse understandings of mental health that fostered critical reflection. A curriculum that supports epistemic equality and a social justice agenda would help scaffold lived experience expertise for student learning. IMPLICATIONS Mental health lived experience education positively impacts social work students’ values and attitudes towards mental health service users. Lived experience education supports social work students to expand their understandings of mental health and recovery beyond dominant biomedical perspectives. Genuine valuing of lived experience knowledge and expertise in social work education helps address epistemic injustice. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - To address the urgent need for effective adolescent mental health support, this systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the impact of mental health literacy interventions on adolescents, a group highly susceptible to mental health issues. In accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and registered under the International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (INPLASY202330098), our research thoroughly searched prominent databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO, CNKI, Wanfang, and Chongqing VIP. We focused on studies employing a pre-test-post-test design to compare mental health literacy interventions against control groups. Our analysis included 18 studies revealing statistically significant improvements in adolescents’ mental health literacy, knowledge, and help-seeking and a reduction in stigma associated with mental health issues. The effectiveness of these interventions varied significantly across regions, with notable improvements in Asia, particularly in terms of help-seeking and stigma reduction. Interventions featuring frequent interactions proved particularly effective, showing significant increases in mental health knowledge and help-seeking. Multifaceted interventions that combined various methods were most beneficial for enhancing mental health knowledge. Importantly, although the positive effects on mental health literacy and stigma reduction were sustained at the 2-month follow-up, the improvements in help-seeking did not maintain significant levels post-intervention. These findings emphasize the critical need for tailored mental health literacy programs for adolescents and provide novel insights into the efficacy of interactive and diverse intervention strategies. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Background: The mental health of nursing students directly affects their future performance, quality of patient care, and personal development. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of research in this area can assist in implementing effective measures to improve the mental health of nursing students. Aim: This study used bibliometric analyses to identify and analyze articles, authors, journals, and research institutes investigating nursing students’ mental health in terms of thematic structure and topic evolution, aiming to provide direction and guidance for future research. Methods: In this retrospective bibliometric analysis, data were downloaded from the Web of Science Core Collection on August 15, 2024. Subsequently, CiteSpace software was employed to analyze the annual number of publications and citations, explore relationships between authors, institutions, countries, and keywords, and summarize research hotspots and frontiers in the field of nursing students’ mental health. Results: Articles published from database inception to August 15, 2024, were screened, leading to the retrieval of 3803 relevant articles. The United States of America was the leading country in terms of research output on the mental health of nursing students, with 982 (25.79%) published articles, while the United States Department of Health and Human Services provided the most funding. Furthermore, Happell, B was the most productive author in this field, with 80 published papers. Lastly, Nurse Education Today was the most prolific journal in nursing education. Conclusion: The main recent research trends include the psychological profile of nursing students, intervention strategies for improving the mental health of nursing students, and the influence of educational methods, clinical experience, and humanistic care on the mental health of nursing students. These trends imply that researchers should develop targeted training programs, apply information technology, and implement personalized teaching to enhance the psychological resilience of the nursing student population. Moreover, higher education institutions should provide nursing students with more comprehensive and effective mental health support by maintaining mental health files, strengthening mental health education, providing psychological counseling services, and establishing social support systems. © © 2025 Hong Xie and Bingyao Kang.

AB  - Introduction: Perinatal depression and anxiety are prevalent, but professional mental health help-seeking remains low, resulting in a lack of utilization of mental health services. We aimed to determine the prevalence of positive mental health help-seeking behaviour (MHHSB) among pregnant women and its associated factors. Materials and methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted at an urban public maternal and child health clinic (MCHC) in Selangor, Klang Valley between August and November 2022. 296 pregnant women were recruited. The Malay version of Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Self-Stigma of Seeking Psychological Help (SSOSH), Mental Health Literacy Scale (MHLS) and MHHSB questionnaires were used for data collection. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify factors. Results: The mean age was 30.06 (±5.14) years and more than two-third (61%, n=181) were multiparous. More than half (57.4%, n=170) were in their second trimester, while 15.9% (n=47) and 21.3% (n=63) had probable depression and anxiety, respectively. The prevalence of positive MHHSB was 73.6% (95% CI: 0.68, 0.78), yet the prevalence of probable getting professional assistance was 22.6% (95% CI: 0.18, 0.28). Two factors were associated with positive MHHSB. These were probable anxiety [odds ratio (OR)3.86, 95% CI: 1.80, 9.15] and MHLS [OR 1.05, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.08]. Conclusion: Positive MHHSB was prevalent among pregnant women, yet the possibility of seeking professional assistance is low. Having anxiety was likely to influence MHHSB, hence efforts to improve mental health literacy and training staff to recognize symptoms and cultivating supportive environment for pregnant women will ensure timely interventions. © 2025 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.

AB  - Objective: The prevalence of mental health problems among youth is high, and help seeking behaviour is low. Mental health literacy (MHL) has been suggested as a factor to enhance mental health knowledge and increase help seeking and coping behaviours. Schools have been recognised as an ideal environment for MHL programs to be delivered to reach a wide range of youth. This study aimed to understand the perspectives and experiences of secondary school students after participating in a MHL program, and how findings aligned with the theoretical model the program is based on. Method: Thirty-eight participants aged 12–16 years provided feedback through an open-ended questionnaire. The questionnaire comprised seven items to gather participants’ experiences and perspectives on the MHL program, including usefulness, ideas for program improvement, impact, and coping strategies. This study was preregistered on the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, Registration Number: ACTRN12621000325808. Results: Reflexive thematic analysis generated three themes and three subthemes from the findings: 1) A safe environment, 2) Perceived positive impact, 2.1) Attitudes towards mental health, 2.2) Coping strategies, 2.3) Need for MHL, and 3) Suggestions for program improvement. Conclusions: These findings indicate that the school-based program meets the current MHL needs of young people, aligns with the MHL Child Focused theoretical model, and was viewed as beneficial to be incorporated into the education system in future. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Nursing students often feel unprepared to care for patients with psychiatric diagnoses and alcohol use disorder (AUD), leading to low confidence, with fear and stigma impacting care. Simulation offers a way to build these skills. Purpose: This project assessed the effectiveness of standardized patients and tag team simulation in increasing nursing students’ exposure and confidence managing mental healthcare and AUD. Methods: A mixed-method pre-post design evaluated student confidence and skills. Students worked in pairs, “tagging” the next pair to continue care. Outcomes measured included the Mental Health Clinical Confidence Scale and student reflections on their simulation experience. Results: Significant improvements were found in empathy (p = 0.021), assisting with living skills (p = 0.002), and conducting suicide risk assessments (p = 0.002). Reflections emphasized communication, empathy, and self-reflection as essential to confidence. Conclusions: Simulation enhances confidence and skills. Research should continue to examine standardized patients and tag team methods in mental health training. © 2025 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Objective Several studies have used the Sport Mental Health Assessment Tool 1 (SMHAT-1) among athletes but none have combined SMHAT-1 with a subsequent clinical intake interview. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic effectiveness of SMHAT-1 supplemented by a brief, in-person clinical intake interview in evaluating the prevalence of mental health concerns in elite athletes. Methods Sections 1 and 2 from SMHAT-1 were administered in person during the routine biannual medical check-up for Olympic athletes at the National Centre for Sports Medicine in Poland. Immediately after completing the measures, all athletes were interviewed by qualified psychologists who evaluated their mental health and provided recommendations. Results A total of 1121 elite athletes (545 female, 576 male) aged 18–53 (M=24.39, SD=5.09) were evaluated 2–8 months before the 2024 Paris Olympic Games; 72.4% scored above the triage threshold and 51% were positively screened in SMHAT-1’s section 2. Based on the subsequent mental health evaluation, only 9.5% showed signs of persistent mental health concerns and required referral to a mental health specialist. In 24.2%, their distress levels/symptoms were assessed as occasional and normal in relation to demands, and they underwent a psychoeducational intervention or were advised to consult a sports psychologist. Female athletes scored significantly higher in most questionnaires. Conclusion SMHAT-1 proved a useful addition to the routine medical check-ups for elite athletes. Extending SMHAT-1 with a brief clinical intake interview substantially elevated the efficacy of the mental health evaluation, with an additional benefit of raising mental health literacy. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

AB  - Background: Mental health conditions are a significant burden during adolescence, with up to 50 % starting before age 14. Suicide is among the top three causes of death in this age group, highlighting the need for effective mental health interventions. Objective: The primary objective of the study is to determine the effectiveness of school-based Scaling up Teen Mental Health Program through peer synergy (SUTMP) on mental health literacy among senior secondary students. Methods: A cluster randomized controlled trial will be conducted among the students of government senior secondary schools. The intervention comprises five modules focusing on mental health literacy, mental health promotion, peer synergy on first aid in mental health, strengthening resilience, and the fifth module focuses on relaxation exercises, meditation and deep breathing techniques, and mindfulness with 'Teen mental health app.' Students will be assessed using the Resilience Scale, Mental Health Promotion Knowledge Scale, Peer Mental Health Stigmatization Scale, Teen Mental Health Literacy Scale, and Peer Synergy on Mental Health First Aid Scale. Assessment will be done before the intervention, one week after, at three and six months post-intervention. Expected results: The anticipated outcome of the study is that the school-based Scaling up Teen Mental Health Program (SUTMP) will increase mental health literacy among school students, strengthen their resilience skills, and increase the use of a peer-led approach for providing initial mental health first aid. Conclusion: The study will employ an innovative module for delivering the intervention, integrating on-site and app-based approaches in a blended manner. © 2024

AB  - Objective: To involve stakeholders in Jiangsu Province, China, to identify barriers for nonspecialist-delivered perinatal depression (PND) management to guide management in maternity and child health care institutions. Methods: In this qualitative study, semi-structured face-to-face individual interviews were used, guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Thematic analysis was done to categorize data using the CFIR framework's domains. Results: There were a total of 20 interviewees. Barriers coded under the CFIR framework included: needs and resources of those served by the organization, cosmopolitanism, available resources, structural characteristics, access to knowledge and information, and knowledge and beliefs. Conclusions: Implementing nonspecialist-delivered PND management poses varying obstacles in different situations. Overcoming these barriers can be accomplished by simplifying interventions based on local conditions, changing women's and families' attitudes and help-seeking behaviors toward PND, establishing linkages with psychiatry, strengthening policymakers' capacity and improving mental health care systems, developing detailed intervention manuals, enhancing clinicians' mental health literacy, and improving the operation of psychologically appropriate approaches to build self-efficacy. © 2024 Zhu et al. published by Sciendo.

AB  - The stigma surrounding mental health remains a significant barrier to help-seeking and well-being in youth populations. The invisibility of mental health issues highlights the critical need for improved knowledge and stigma reduction, underscoring the urgency of tackling this issue. Arts-based interventions have shown promise in addressing stigma, yet comprehensive longitudinal studies in community settings are limited. This research evaluates the "WeARTolerance’’ arts-based program in reducing mental health stigma among diverse youths. The program integrated psychoeducational and creative activities (e.g., visual arts, cinema, music, and theatre) to explore mental health themes, with 125 teenagers and young adult participants (M = 13.70; SD = 2.06). The present mixed-method study was split into two phases with complementary objectives: 1) evaluate quantitatively the program’s impact in reducing social stigma and related outcomes; 2) explore in-depth qualitative feedback about the program. For the first phase, reliable self-report questionnaires were used to measure mental health knowledge, social stigma, intergroup anxiety, and social distance in pre-, post-, and 6-month follow-up periods. Participants’ age and past psychiatric issues were fixed factors with random intercepts, and mixed effects models were used to analyze the attitudinal outcomes across time. In the second phase of this validation, nine teenagers aged between 12 and 16 participated in two focus groups conducted three months after the program. Its contents underwent thorough analysis using content analysis techniques. The quantitative results from Phase 1 demonstrated a decreasing trend in all primary outcomes. In phase 2, participants acknowledged the activities’ relevance, reported overall satisfaction with the program, and showed great enthusiasm and willingness to learn more. Arts-based interventions like "WeARTolerance" are valuable for challenging stigma and fostering understanding in youth populations and provide an alternative and creative way to increase mental health literacy. The study proposes a program to reduce youth mental health stigma through arts-based elements, early intervention, and psychoeducation, involving collaborations between professionals and artists to promote youth engagement. Future studies should include indirect social contact and randomized controlled interventions. © 2024 Beato et al.

AB  - Background: Stigma education for nursing students has focused solely on stigma reduction, with studies showing temporary improvements in attitudes. However, nursing education research should also emphasize the importance of critical reflection and self-reflection to enhance attitudes, beliefs, topic comprehension, and learning satisfaction. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the “This is me” intervention regarding knowledge, attitudes, and communication skills of senior undergraduate nursing students in responding to mental illness-related stigma. Methods: This study employed a psychoeducational intervention for reducing mental illness stigma, using a questionnaire survey to assess pre- and post-intervention effects, with 37 eligible nursing students undergoing clinical training in psychiatric services between 16 May and 15 July 2022. Instruments included sociodemographic and health questions, the MICA-4 scale to evaluate students’ attitudes toward mental illness, the MAKS to measure mental health knowledge, the Empathy Scale (JSPE-S), the Intergroup Anxiety Scale (SS-12), and the Attribution Questionnaire (AQ-27). Results: Most students were female (73.0%) and single (70.3%), with a mean age of around 29 years. After implementing the psychoeducational program, there was a statistically significant increase in overall stigma-related knowledge (MAKS: Z = −1.99, p < 0.05), a decrease in intergroup anxiety (IAS: Z = −3.42, p < 0.05), and reductions in the perceptions of patients as dangerous (AQ27—Dangerousness: Z = −2.399, p < 0.05) and fear (AQ27—Fear: Z = −2.415, p < 0.05). Additionally, there was an improvement in empathy, specifically in Perspective Taking (JSPE: Z = −2.555, p < 0.05). Conclusions: This program may contribute to mental health literacy related to stigma, positively impacting therapeutic relationships and communication with people with mental illness and resulting in more effective care practices. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Adolescent eating disorders pose a significant public health challenge and strongly affect both physical and emotional well-being. Early diagnosis is important for improving treatment outcomes, though it remains complex due to multiple influencing factors. The family perspective is essential in this process, as it provides valuable insights into changes in adolescents’ habits and emotional health. Methods: A descriptive qualitative study was conducted between January and February 2023. Interviews were conducted with 12 participants using a phenomenological approach to explore the experiences and perspectives of family members of adolescents with eating disorders. Results: Four thematic blocks comprising several categories were identified: (T1) diagnosis, (T2) family, (T3) resources, and (T4) treatment. The participants emphasized the need for early intervention and a multidisciplinary approach to the treatment of eating disorders. Family therapy was recognized as vital to treatment, and common dissatisfaction with the public health structure underscores the need for greater investment in research and access to specialists. Mental health nurse practitioners play an important role in providing comprehensive care and support, as well as mental health literacy. Conclusions: A holistic, patient-centered approach, including family involvement and appropriate support systems, is key to improving the outcomes and quality of life of adolescents undergoing treatment for eating disorders. Improving healthcare resources and addressing the challenges faced by families is essential. In addition, mental health literacy is critical, as it enables families to understand the disease better, make informed decisions, and actively participate in the recovery process, thus contributing to improved therapeutic outcomes and quality of life for patients. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Obsessive–compulsive (OC) disorder is a debilitating disorder with a high delay in help-seeking that could be associated with two barriers that may differ between OC content dimensions: public stigma and mental health literacy. Objectives: We aim to describe and analyze the differences among OC content dimensions in public stigma, social distance desire, mental health literacy, and help-seeking intention in a sample of the mental health-naïve population. Methods: A total of 487 participants from the Spanish community with no previous knowledge of or experience with OCD were randomly allocated one of six vignettes describing a person with OC symptoms of one out of six contents (i.e., aggression/harm; sexual; religious/blasphemous/immoral; contamination/washing; doubts/checking; or superstition/symmetry/order). After reading the vignette, participants completed the following questionnaires associated with their vignette: Attribution Questionnaire, General Help-Seeking Questionnaire, Social Distance Scale, and Mental Health Literacy Questionnaire. Results: There were significant differences among OC content dimensions on the variables of interest. Aggression/harm OC content was associated with the highest public stigma and discriminating desire, and together with the religious/blasphemous/immoral OC contents were associated with the highest social distance desire. Although no differences appear between contents on intention to seek for formal treatment, participants would request less informal support for their sexual OC content than for the other categories. Contamination, doubts/checking, and superstition/symmetry/order OC contents were more frequently identified as OCD, although only around 50% or less of the sample identified the sexual, superstition/symmetry/order, doubts/checking, and religious/blasphemous/immoral OC contents as a mental health problem. Conclusions: Interventions to reduce stigma and increase help seeking are necessary and should consider OC heterogeneity. © 2024 The Author(s). Brain and Behavior published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Objective: Mental illnesses are the largest disease burden for adolescents, affecting 20 % of youth in Canada. As mental health needs arise earlier and with greater prevalence, it is essential to work upstream and prepare youth before psychological distress emerges. When implemented in the classroom as part of the educational curriculum, Mental Health Literacy (MHL) fulfills these goals as a universal response to the societal and development stressors experienced by youth. The aim of this implementation evaluation was to explore the experience of educators delivering the Elementary Mental Health Literacy Resources (EMHLR) during a 4-month period across Canada. The specific objectives were to identify the individual (educator) and organizational (district) level barriers and facilitators to delivery of the EMHLR to improve future implementation of the program. Methods: An explanatory sequential design used data from an existing feedback survey and qualitative data was gathered from group interviews with Educators. Findings were integrated using the RE-AIM framework to identify barriers and facilitators and develop considerations for implementation Results: System level barriers included the pre-existing stigma around mental health, competing priorities for classroom time, and cultivating buy-in from leadership. Individual level barriers included the time and knowledge to teach MHL. The flexible design of the EMHLR curriculum and specific implementation strategies were seen as facilitators. Mental Health Literacy offers language for youth to communicate about their experience clearly and accurately. Conclusion: The EMHLR curriculum offers an evidence-based and adaptable means to build the MHL of youth across Canada.

AB  - Mental health problems are common among higher education students, yet formal help-seeking rates remain low. Mental health literacy (MHL) is crucial in facilitating help-seeking, but its relationship with formal help-seeking behaviors among ethnic minority students is poorly understood. This study explored MHL among Palestinian minority students in Israel using Jorm's framework, examining the association between each MHL dimension and formal help-seeking. It also investigated information-seeking methods and their relations to actual help-seeking. 129 Palestinian students completed measures of MHL, formal help-seeking, information-seeking methods, sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Participants reported average or above-average levels on all MHL dimensions. Compared to those who did not report actual formal help-seeking, those who did have significantly higher levels of MHL on all dimensions, except for the ability to recognize disorders. The three dimensions - knowledge of risk factors and causes; knowledge of where to seek information; and attitudes that promote recognition or appropriate help-seeking behavior – were found to be significant determinants of formal help-seeking behaviors. Online information-seeking was an important determinant of formal help-seeking. This study supports the association between MHL and formal help-seeking behaviors, even among students from ethnic minorities. Interventions targeting MHL could enhance help-seeking behaviors in this population. This study underlines the crucial role of the Internet in minority students' lives in the context of mental health, similar to its importance in other areas of their lives. They also identify key areas for psychiatric mental health nursing to focus on for more effective education and interventions tailored to minority student populations. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Sleep and mental health are intimately related and shown to impact graduate students enrolled in health sciences programs, including physical therapy education. Doctorate of Physical Therapy (DPT) students’ attitudes and behaviors surrounding sleep and whether these factors are associated with mental health are unknown. This study aimed to describe sleep behaviors and attitudes of entry-level DPT students and to explore the relationship between subjectively reported sleep quality and self-reported symptoms of anxiety in these students. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey consisting of the Sleep Practices and Attitudes Questionnaire (SPAQ), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) questionnaire, and demographic questions were used. Analyses investigated sleep behaviors and attitudes, along with the relationship (unadjusted odds ratio) between restless sleep and anxiety in DPT students in hybrid and traditional DPT programs across the United States (US). Results: A total of 271 DPT students completed the survey. A majority of students reported feeling tired during most days (80.8%, n = 219), a quarter of participants (24.7%) reported having a history of trouble sleeping and four (1.5%) reported being diagnosed with a sleep disorder. Of those who reported their sleep duration, participants slept an average of 6.86 h. The mean GAD-7 score was 7.68 (SD = 4.90), suggestive of mild anxiety. Sixty-seven (24.7%) reported having a diagnosed anxiety disorder, with generalized anxiety being the most common diagnosis. Those who reported having restless sleep were 4.09 times more likely to have moderate to severe anxiety [unadjusted odds ratio = 4.09 (95% CI 2.27,7.35; p < 0.001)] compared to those who reported restful sleep. Conclusions: DPT students who rated sleep as restless exhibit signs of poor subjective sleep quality associated with an increased risk of experiencing moderate to severe anxiety compared to students who had restful sleep. Students reported behaviors surrounding sleep that may contribute to anxiety. These findings have implications for including sleep and mental health education and practices within DPT programs. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Aim: The study aimed to determine the relationship between general nurses' mental health literacy and beliefs toward mental illness. Method: The study involved 285 nurses aged 23 to 47 from three hospitals in western Turkey, who completed the Mental Health Literacy Scale (MHLS) and the Beliefs Toward Mental Illness Scale (BMIS) between December 2023 and March 2024. Results: Those who received training on mental illnesses as students (t = 2.115, p = 0.018), those who had moderate knowledge about mental illnesses (F = 8.177, p < 0.001), those who were willing to receive training on mental illnesses (t = 1.673, p = 0.048), those who encounter individuals with mental illness in their work units (F = 11.233, p < 0.001) and those who care for individuals with mental illness in their work units (t = 1.808, p = 0.036) have higher mental health literacy levels. There was a negative relationship between nurses' negative beliefs toward mental illness levels and their mental health literacymental health literacy levels (r = −0.432, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Mental health literacy is a crucial element in reducing general nurses' negative beliefs about mental illnesses. Thıus, psychiatric mental health nurses can actively prevent negative beliefs and increase awareness by providing mental health education to general nurses. Awareness programs should be accorded greater emphasize on individuals who are not trained in mental disorders when they are students, those who have low knowledge about mental disorders, those who are reluctant to receive training on mental disorders, and cohorts of nurses who are likely to encounter patients with mental disorders in their respective work units. © 2024

AB  - Introduction/problem: Anxiety disorders are increasingly prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Limited data exist on factors contributing to anxiety, particularly among final year junior high school (JHS) students in Ghana preparing for the Basic Education Certificate Exam (BECE). Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the factors influencing anxiety levels among final year JHS students in Ghana, focusing on hunger, parental support, sleep duration, co-occurring mental health concerns, gender, and other variables. Methods: A sample of 394 final year JHS students in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana was surveyed using established measures for anxiety, sleep duration, parental support, hunger, substance use, and mental health concerns. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to explore the relationships between these variables and anxiety levels among students. Key findings: The study revealed a high prevalence of anxiety among final year JHS students, with 71.4% exhibiting symptoms above the chronic anxiety cut-off point. Significant factors associated with anxiety included hunger, living with a single parent, and co-occurring mental health concerns. Age, gender, access to school counseling, school type, and substance use showed no significant associations with anxiety. Conclusions/implications: The findings underscore the need for a comprehensive approach to addressing anxiety among final year JHS students, considering socio-economic factors, family dynamics, and mental health support. Stakeholders can use these insights to develop targeted interventions that promote mental well-being and academic success. Recommendations: Enhancing access to mental health services, addressing socio-economic disparities, providing support for students from single-parent households, and integrating mental health education into school curricula are recommended. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The aim of this umbrella review is to summarize evidence on factors that influence help-seeking and service utilization for professional mental healthcare among young people ages 0–30. The CINAHL, Cochrane, Epistemonikos, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science databases were searched in December 2023 for systematic reviews in English. The search yielded 26 eligible reviews, all of which are medium or high quality. Primary study overlap was rare. Using an established framework, we organize intrapersonal (n = 37), interpersonal (n = 14), institutional (n = 9), community (n = 7), and public policy (n = 6) factors. The most frequently reviewed factor at each level is trust of professionals (intrapersonal), close others' support for treatment (interpersonal), cost (institutional), availability (community), and insurance (public policy). Stigma is widely referenced (18 reviews) and classified as multi-dimensional. Narrative synthesis reveals population-specific variability (e.g., rural, racial/ethnic minority, refugees, immigrants) in the importance of many factors. To develop interventions and healthcare systems sensitive to young people's needs, we recommend promoting stigma-reduction campaigns, and targeting trustworthiness, affordability, anonymity, accessibility, and mental health literacy. Identifying commonalities and differences across populations and contexts assists in the design of nuanced and efficient treatment delivery systems for young people, who are at a critical time for their mental health. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Global trends indicate a rise in mental health disorders among youth, prompting need for effective interventions. Mental health literacy interventions have demonstrated benefits such as improved knowledge, treatment understanding, help-seeking behaviors, and stigma reduction. This study aimed to assess the impact of a comprehensive mental health literacy program on knowledge, attitudes, and stigma related to mental health among secondary school students in Chennai. Methods: Cluster-randomized controlled trial was conducted among students from four secondary schools. Randomization was at cluster level to minimize contamination. Participating schools provided consent, and all ninth-grade students were invited to participate. Written informed consent was obtained from parents/guardians, and assent was obtained from students. There were no specific exclusion criteria, except for students who declined to participate. Analyses were performed using intention-to-treat principles, with multiple imputation for missing outcome data. Results: After adjusting for cluster effects, the intervention group showed a significant improvement in attitude scores compared to the control group (mean difference 0.85, 95 % CI: 0.32–1.39, p = 0.002). However, no significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of knowledge and stigma. Conclusion: The findings suggest that delivering a mental health literacy curriculum alongside contact-based education involving individuals with lived experiences of mental disorders positively influences students' attitudes toward mental health. Although no significant changes were observed in knowledge and stigma levels, the integration of mental health literacy programs with personal narratives from those with lived experiences holds promise for addressing mental health stigma and promoting positive attitudes among school students. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Summary Statement Screen-based simulation is an effective educational strategy that can enhance health care students' engagement with content and critical thinking across various topics, including mental health. To create relevant and realistic simulations, best-practice guidelines recommend the involvement of experts in the development process. We collaborated with persons with lived experience and community partners to cocreate a mental health-focused screen-based simulation. Cocreating meant establishing a nonhierarchical partnership, with shared decision-making from start to finish. In this article, we present 8 principles developed to guide our cocreation with persons with lived experience: person-centeredness, trauma-informed approaches and ethical guidance, supportive environment, two-way partnership, mutual respect, choice and flexibility, open communication, and room to grow. These principles provide practical guidance for educators seeking to engage the expertise of persons who have been historically disadvantaged in society. By sharing these principles, we strive to contribute to a more equitable process in simulation development and promote meaningful, respectful, and safer collaborations. © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Mental health literacy (MHL) was introduced 25 years ago as knowledge and beliefs about mental disorders which aid in their recognition, management, or prevention. This scoping review mapped the peer-reviewed literature to assess characteristics of secondary school-based surveys in school-attending youth and explore components of school-based programs for fostering MHL in this population. The search was performed following the method for scoping reviews by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI). Searches were conducted in four scientific databases with no time limit, although all sources had to be written in English. Primary studies (N = 44) provided insight into MHL surveys and programs for school-attending youth across 6 continents. Studies reported that most youth experience moderate or low MHL prior to program participation. School-based MHL programs are relatively unified in their definition and measures of MHL, using closed-ended scales, vignettes, or a combination of the two to measure youth MHL. However, before developing additional interventions, steps should be taken to address areas of weakness in current programming, such as the lack of a standardized tool for assessing MHL levels. Future research could assess the feasibility of developing and implementing a standard measurement protocol, with educator perspectives on integrating MHL efforts into the classroom. Identifying the base levels of MHL amongst school-attending youth promotes the development of targeted programs and reviewing the alignment with program components would allow researchers to build on what works, alter what does not, and come away with new ways to approach these complex challenges, ultimately advancing knowledge of MHL and improving levels of MHL. © Crown 2024.

AB  - A quarter of all children grow up in a family where a parent experiences a mental illness (FaPMI). Research activity in this area is growing rapidly and it is now critical to better understand the extant knowledge in the field. This scoping review of quantitative FaPMI literature parallels a qualitative literature review and a series of Delphi studies with key stakeholders (e.g. lived experience and clinicians), that is part of a larger program of research to achieve consensus regarding the direction of FaPMI research; including making recommendations about outcomes and measures. The programme of research aims to promote and facilitate greater comparison and learning across studies and settings. Initially this scoping review summarises the quality and focus (e.g. country and sampling) of 50 quantitative studies from 2000 to 2023 and then classifies studies according to outcomes for parents, children and families. Six to eleven years were the most common child sample group and girls were slightly underrepresented (49/51) and parents were 88% mothers. Analogous parent and child outcomes were; mental illness/psychopathology, wellbeing, mental health literacy, trauma and stressful experiences, coping, help seeking/service need, within family relationships and supports, outside family relationships and supports. Additional outcomes for parents were; parenting skills, parent competence and parenting stress and for children in relation to their; cognitive functioning and caregiving. The family related outcomes were the within and outside family relationships and supports. Since 2000 there have been 136 different survey instruments employed with approximately 80% used in only one study. This suggests that the broader goals of the program of research are warranted as there is a need for less heterogeneity in measures used. Suggested areas for future research include a sampling focus on fathers, economic evaluations of programs, parent mental health literacy, trauma, genetics and integrating well-being concepts into research designs. Child research should focus on mental health literacy, the level and impact of caring responsibilities, assessing past trauma and the roles of close family and external supports. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Mental health problems, such as depression, have a high prevalence in young people. However, the majority of youths suffering from depression do not seek professional help. This study aimed to compare help-seeking behavior, intentions and perceived barriers between youthswith different levels of depressive symptoms. Methods: This cross-sectional study is part of a large-scale, multi-center project. Participants were n = 9509 youths who were recruited in German schools and completed a baseline screening questionnaire. Based on their depressive symptoms, youths were allocated to the following three subgroups: (a) without depressive symptoms, (b) with subclinical symptoms, (c) with clinical symptoms (measured by PHQ-A). Quantitative analyses compared previous help-seeking behavior, help-seeking intentions and perceived barriers (Barriers questionnaire) between these subgroups. An additional exploratory qualitative content analysis examined text answers on other perceived barriers to help-seeking. Results: Participants were mostly female (n = 5575, 58.6%) and 12 to 24 years old (M = 15.09, SD 2.37). Participants with different levels of depressive symptoms differed significantly in help-seeking behavior, intentions and perceived barriers. Specifically, participants with clinical depressive symptoms reported more previous help-seeking, but lower intentions to seek help compared to participants without symptoms (all p < 0.05). Participants with subclinical depressive symptoms reported a similar frequency of previous help-seeking, but higher intentions to seek help compared to participants without symptoms (all p < 0.05). Perception of barriers was different across subgroups: participants with clinical and subclinical depressive symptoms perceived the majority of barriers such as stigma, difficulties in accessibility, and family-related barriers as more relevant than participants without depressive symptoms. Across all subgroups, participants frequently mentioned intrapersonal reasons, a high need for autonomy, and a lack of mental health literacy as barriers to help-seeking. Conclusions: Youths with higher levels of depressive symptoms are more reluctant to seek professional help and perceive higher barriers. This underlines the need for effective and low-threshold interventions to tackle barriers, increase help-seeking, and lower depressive symptoms in adolescents and young adults differing in depression severity.

AB  - Background: Asians and Asian Americans have the lowest rate of mental health service utilization (25%) in the US compared to other racial/ethnic groups (39 − 52%), despite high rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. The lack of culturally-responsive mental health trainings hinders access to mental health services for these populations. We assessed the mental health priorities of Asian communities in Greater Boston and evaluated cultural responsiveness of the Mental Health First Aid (MHFA), a first-responder training teaching participants skills to recognize signs of mental health and substance use challenges, and how to appropriately respond. Methods: This is community-based participatory research with the Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center (BCNC), Asian Women For Health (AWFH), and the Addressing Disparities in Asian Populations through Translational Research (ADAPT) Coalition. We conducted focus groups with community-based organization staff and community members to assess mental health priorities of Asian populations in Boston, MA. We then evaluated the utility and cultural-responsiveness of the English-language MHFA for Asian populations through pre- and post-training questionnaires and focus groups with community participants. Paired t-tests were used to evaluate questionnaire responses. Thematic analysis was used to analyze interviews. Results: In total, ten staff and eight community members participated in focus groups, and 24 community members completed the MHFA and pre- and post-training questionnaires. Common mental health challenges in the Asian communities reported by participants were loneliness, high stigma around mental illnesses, academic pressure, and acculturation stress. Compared to pre-training, MHFA participants demonstrated lower personal mental health stigma (p < 0.001) and higher mental health literacy (p = 0.04) post-training. Participants also noted the lack of data statistics and case studies relevant to Asian populations in the training, and desired the training be offered in languages spoken by Asian ethnic subgroups (e.g., Chinese, Vietnamese). Conclusion: Cultural-responsiveness of the MHFA for Asian populations could be improved with the inclusion of data and case studies that capture common mental health challenges in the Asian communities and with translation of the MHFA to non-English languages predominant in Asian communities. Increasing the cultural relevance and language accessibility of the MHFA could facilitate wider adoption of these trainings across communities and help to reduce mental health stigma and gaps in literacy and service utilization. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Mental health literacy among youth is crucial for the early detection and intervention in mental health disorders. Despite growing awareness, many young individuals lack the knowledge to recognize and respond to mental health concerns effectively. Educational interventions, such as targeted practice sessions, offer promise in addressing this gap. This study investigates the effectiveness of targeted practice sessions in enhancing students' ability to identify mental disorders. Situational questions were employed to assess participants' comprehension of various psychological disorders, including depression, post-traumatic stress, stress, and social phobia. A total of 80 high school students from Hoang Hoa 2 High School, Thanh Hoa, Vietnam, participated, with 40 assigned to the control group and 40 to the experimental group. The Paired-Samples T-test was used for data analysis, with a significance level of p < 0.05. Results revealed significant improvements in recognition abilities among students in the experimental group, highlighting the efficacy of targeted interventions in promoting mental health literacy. The study underscores the importance of addressing mental health literacy within educational settings and contributes valuable insights into evidence-based strategies for enhancing students' understanding of psychological disorders. Targeted practice sessions represent a promising approach to promoting mental health awareness and support among youth, with implications for improving mental health outcomes and reducing stigma surrounding mental illness. © 2024 Malque Publishing.

AB  - Background: Mental health literacy is a promising avenue of intervention for addressing the development of psychopathology, as well as its associated consequences, such as a decrease in academic performance. The current study aims to test the effectiveness of such an intervention in high school students, focusing on two main formats of delivery: (1) automated and (2) blended. Methods: To achieve this aim, a randomized clinical trial with direct comparisons at three time points between three conditions (automated, blended, and waitlist) was designed. Power analyses yielded a necessary sample size of 264 high school students. The participants will be selected from Romanian high schools. Discussion: The current study aims to contribute to the mental health literacy literature by testing the effectiveness of an educational intervention concerning mental health in terms of its benefits for reducing psychopathology and increasing academic performance. The success of such an intervention bears important implications for addressing mental health in the educational system.

AB  - Introduction: Mental complications of diabetes are one of the main obstacles to the implementation of self -care behaviors that have been less studied. Therefore, this study was conducted to survey the effective factors in predicting burnout and self-care behaviors among patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods: In this Path analysis, 1280 patients with type 2 diabetes were selected from Mashhad (Iran) in 2023 to 2024. Four scales, the mental health literacy (MHL) scale, diabetes burnout scale, diabetes distress scale, and self-care behavior scale were used for data gathering. AMOS software checked the direct and indirect paths between the variables. Results: In the path analysis, variables of MHL and diabetes distress predicted 25% variance of diabetes burnout (R2 = 0.25), and diabetes distress (total effect = 0.491) had the greatest impact on predicting diabetes burnout. Variables of MHL, diabetes distress, and diabetes burnout predicted 12% variance of Self-care behaviors (R2 = 0.12) and MHL (total effect = -0.256), age of onset of diabetes (total effect = 0.199), and diabetes burnout (total effect = − 0.167) had the greatest impact on prediction of self-care behaviors. Conclusion: MHL could reduce diabetes distress and burnout and eventually promote self-care behaviors among patients with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, screening and identifying psychological problems (such as distress and burnout) and designing interventions to increase MHL can ultimately increase the health of patients with diabetes. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Background: The incidence of mental health problems among medical graduate students is much higher than among students of other disciplines. This can have adverse consequences for the medical students themselves as well as their future patients. This study aims to understand the pressures faced by Chinese medical students and the current status of mental health education. It also propose recommendations for the current situation and prospects for the future. Method: The authors conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with 22 master’s students from five medical schools during November 2023. All interview sessions were recorded and transcribed verbatim. The transcriptions were analyzed using the Colaizzi’s seven-step method. Result: Three main themes were extracted from the students’ statements: sources of psychological stress, ways to cope with stress, and perspectives on mental health education. The study showed that current mental health education in China is mostly in the form of printed mental health education manuals and mental health lectures, and there is no active tiered intervention for students at different levels. It is suggested that reforms should be made to shift to a model where the school proactively identifies problems and intervenes based on feedback. Conclusion: This study reveals the widespread psychological stress and shortcomings in current education methods. To address these challenges, institutions should develop tailored interventions, including tiered support systems, open dialogue promotion, and resilience training. Future research should focus on evaluating innovative interventions’ effectiveness, ultimately fostering a supportive environment that enhances students’ success and contributes to a healthier healthcare workforce. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Background: Mental health problems among adolescents is a global challenge. During the transition to adolescence, physiological, psychological, and social changes occur, leading to increased vulnerability. Thus, adolescent boys are less likely to seek help for mental health problems, which makes them an undetected group. The aim of this study was to gain a deeper understanding of adolescent boys’ experiences of mental health and school health service. Methods: An inductive, qualitative design was chosen using three focus group interviews and three individual interviews. The study included 18 adolescent boys in 7th grade, in a school located in a medium-sized municipality in Norway. The interviews were analysed with qualitative content analysis. The consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ) were followed in this study. Results: The overall theme “barriers towards seeking help”, and three categories— navigating stigma and privacy concerns; perceptions of self-responsibility; and lacking knowledge of mental health problems and help-seeking—described the adolescent boys experiences. The awareness and willingness to seek help were present, but there are barriers preventing the adolescent boys from acting on that willingness. Conclusions: Lack of knowledge and a non-permissive culture for mental health problems among adolescents contributes to decreased help-seeking behaviour among adolescent boys. The school health service is the most related health service for adolescents and should focus on being available and strengthening empowerment and mental health literacy through the development and implementation of interventions to promote mental health. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Background: Depression is a common mental health disorder and the second leading cause of disability worldwide. In people with depression, low depression literacy, which could be characterized by a poor recognition of depressive symptoms and less knowledge about the availability of treatment options, can hinder adequate therapy for depression. Nevertheless, questionnaires measuring depression literacy in Germany are rare. Consequently, for the present study, the German Depression Literacy Scale (D-Lit) has been revised and evaluated. Methods: First, a team of clinical psychologists revised the D-Lit German scale. Next, cognitive interviews were conducted with patients with depression to improve the comprehensibility of the scale items. Our revision of the D-Lit-R German scale was then subjected to an anonymous online study. Finally, the data went through an exploratory factor analysis, and sociodemographic subgroup analyses were performed. Results: N = 524 individuals (age 18–80) completed the D-Lit-R German scale and a questionnaire on their sociodemographic data. Cronbach´s alpha was estimated as α =.72, and McDonald's Omega (categorical) was estimated as ω =.77. The mean Item difficulty was M =.75 (SD =.15). An EFA was performed for a unidimensional model, a 5-factor-model and at last a 3-factor-model. The 5-factorial model showed a good model fit (χ2<inf>emp,WLSMV</inf>(131) = 92.424, p >.05; CFI = 1, RMSEA = 0, SRMR =.07) but was rejected since the content of the potential 5 factors could not be determined. The 3-factor model showed an arguable model fit. The Chi2 test was significant (χ2<inf>emp,WLSMV</inf>(168) = 199.912, p <.05), but the CFI and the RMSEA met an acceptable model fit (CFI =.990, RMSEA of.019, 90% CI[.003,.029]). Substantively, the three factors were defined as (1) Distractors and other symptoms, (2) Depressive symptoms, and (3) Pharmacological and psychotherapeutic depression treatment. Furthermore, there were significant differences in sum scores regarding the subgroup's gender, treatment for mental health problems, depression treatment, experience with depression, and different career fields. Conclusions: The D-Lit-R German scale is a time-efficient scale to assess some aspects of the depression literacy construct that can be easily applied. Since there was no perfect model fit, it is recommended to continue to revise the scale. Further evaluation studies could ask for knowledge of the etiological factors of depression. Future studies could then use this instrument to convey depression literacy. This instrument could assess the growth of knowledge after psychoeducational interventions in different settings.

AB  - Background: Newly recruited nurses face multiple sources of stress and their coping styles need to be focused on to ensure good mental health. This study aimed to examine the relationship among mental health literacy, psychological capital and coping styles in newly recruited nurses. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in August and September 2022. A total of 315 newly recruited nurses were recruited in a tertiary hospital in Henan Province, central China, employing the convenience sampling method. The self-reported questionnaires were sent through a QR code, including the Mental Health Literacy Scale for Healthcare Students, Psychological Capital Questionnaire, and Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire. Pearson correlation analysis was used to evaluate the relationships among the variables. Mediation analysis was performed to identify the mediating effect of psychological capital on the relationship between mental health literacy and coping styles. Results: Positive coping showed a positive relationship with psychological capital and mental health literacy, while negative coping showed a negative relationship with psychological capital and mental health literacy. For positive coping, psychological capital was a partial mediator with an effect of 0.140, accounting for 62.8%. For negative coping, a full mediating effect was shown by psychological capital between mental health literacy and negative coping, with an indirect effect of -0.048. Conclusion: Psychological capital plays a partial and complete mediating role between mental health literacy and different coping styles among newly recruited nurses. Diversified training and personalized guidance in improving mental health literacy and increasing psychological capital simultaneously can be provided to newly recruited nurses continuously to adjust their coping styles. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The prevalence of mental disorders in adolescents has a considerable impact on daily life, restricting tasks and diminishing overall quality of life while potentially leading to stigmatization. This study aims to measure the impact of a mental health literacy intervention program, called “Bicho de 7 Cabeças” project, in b-learning format, on the increase of knowledge and the decrease of stigma in young people from Póvoa de Varzim, in Portugal. A quasi-experimental study was conducted, from November 2022 to May 2023, involving an experimental group (“Bicho de 7 Cabeças” protocol) and an active control group (informational brochures), utilizing a pre-test/post-test design. Mental Health Literacy Measure-MHLM, Mental Health Promoting Knowledge Scale-MHPK-10, Mental Illness Knowledge Schedule-MAKS, Reported and Intended Behaviour Scale-RIBS, and Community Attitudes toward People with Mental Illness-CAMI were used. A total of 504 young students from the 9th grade enroll in this study, with a mean age around 14 years old. There is a significant difference between stigma (p <.001) and knowledge (p <.001) scores at baseline and follow-up. The results of this study shows that interventions aimed at young people for the promotion of mental health literacy and stigma reduction are needed and more initiatives should be implemented in schools to address these problems. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Background: In the context of Greece, many instruments measuring constructs pertinent to child and adolescent mental health lacked a locally-validated, freely-available version. As part of a nationwide survey, we translated and cross-culturally adapted a collection of seventeen brief, largely-employed assessment tools that can be used at scale. Methods: This study is part of the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Initiative in Greece (CAMHI), a capacity-building program focusing on enhancing mental health care for children and adolescents living in Greece. We conducted a nationwide survey assessing mental health symptoms, parenting practices, service availability and quality, mental health literacy and stigma, and professional practices within the country. As part of this process, we selected outcomes and instruments after consulting the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM) and the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN). From our selection, we identified 17 instruments that did not have a Greek-validated version available for use. These instruments were translated and cross-culturally adapted following a structured procedure, including independent back-and-forth translations, synthesis of versions, expert revision, and pilot testing. Some instruments were slightly modified to meet CAMHI survey purposes. Results: A cross-culturally adapted version in Greek was made available for the following instruments: Pediatric Symptoms Checklist (PSC); Deliberate Self Harm Inventory (DSH) (modified); Child and Adolescent Trauma Screen-2 (CATS-2); ABCD Screen Use (modified); Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham-IV (SNAP-IV); Parent Behavior Inventory (PBI); Mental Health Literacy Scale (MHLS)—(modified); Australian Mental Health Vignettes; Reported and Intended Behavior Scale (RIBS); Barriers to Access to Care (BACE) (modified); Experience of Service Questionnaire (ESQ) (modified); and Multitheoretical List of Therapeutic Interventions (MULTI-30) (modified). Conclusion: A collection of these widely-used assessment tools is now adapted for the local context and freely accessible at [https://osf.io/crz6h/]. Researchers and health professionals in Greece can utilize this resource to screen, evaluate, and monitor various constructs related to mental health in accordance with the most effective practices. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Background and purpose: Mental health disorders are a growing concern worldwide, with a significant impact on public health. Understanding attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help is essential in addressing these issues. In the Iranian context, there is a need for a reliable tool to measure these attitudes. This study aims to assess the validity and reliability of the Persian Adaptation of the Attitudes Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help Scale-Short Form (ATSPPH-SF). Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in May 2023, utilizing a convenience sampling method with 1050 participants aged 10 to 65 years in Iran.The ATSPPH-SF questionnaire, consisting of 10 items and 2 subscales, was employed. The questionnaire underwent translation and cultural adaptation, and its validity was assessed through qualitative face and content validities. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to evaluate construct validity. Reliability was assessed using McDonald’s omega coefficient and Cronbach’s alpha coefficient. Data collection was conducted through an online survey. Results: The CFA results indicated a two-factor structure for the ATSPPH-SF, with one factor representing openness to seeking treatment for emotional problems and the other factor reflecting the value and need for seeking treatment. The model demonstrated acceptable fit indices. Both McDonald’s omega coefficient and Cronbach’s alpha coefficient suggested good internal consistency for the scale. The mean total score for the ATSPPH-SF was 21.37 (SD = 5.52), indicating the reliability and validity of the scale for the Iranian population. Conclusion: This study confirms the suitability of the short-form ATSPPH-SF with 10 items and 2 subscales as a valid and reliable tool for assessing attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help in the Iranian population. With no prior appropriate instrument available, this scale fills a crucial gap. It can be employed to measure attitudes among various demographic groups, aiding in the design of targeted interventions to enhance mental health literacy and reduce the stigma associated with seeking professional psychological help in Iran. © 2024, The Author(s).

AB  - Research shows the important role of parents’ mental health literacy in detecting depressive symptoms and supporting their children to seek professional help. Improving mental health literacy in parents has recently gained even greater importance due to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children and adolescents’ mental health. The aim of the present experimental pre-post-follow-up study was to examine knowledge change after the reception of contents from an innovative web-based platform (www.ich-bin-alles.de/eltern) containing evidence-based information on youth depression and mental health in parents of adolescents with a history of depression. A second aim was to assess evaluation of the layout and the acceptance of the platform. N = 33 parents of adolescents with a history of depression (either current or remitted depression) were presented different content domains of the website. Participants’ knowledge about depression was assessed at pre- and post-intervention, and at a four week follow-up. Moreover, parents evaluated the acceptance and the layout of the website. The trial was preregistered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05335564). The results showed a significant increase in total knowledge from pre to post, which remained stable over the course of four weeks. Explorative analyses showed that sociodemographic variables did not influence the extent of knowledge gain. Acceptance rates were high and evaluations of the website’s layout were positive. The findings show that the web-based information portal is a promising and appealing means to increase parental knowledge on youth depression. Low-threshold psychoeducational approaches like websites are particularly relevant in times of crisis and increased prevalence rates of depressive symptoms and disorders (ehealth). These results are an important basis for future studies as well as approaches that aim to impart knowledge about mental disorders like youth depression via web-based means. Furthermore, they bear implications for policy decisions concerning mental health education and campaigns. © 2024, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: The relationship between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and mental health later in life has been well-established. However, first-person qualitative narratives describing how ACEs negatively impact mental health of young adults are rare. Objective: Qualitative data explores how young adults with serious mental health conditions (SMHC) describe childhood adversities and relate those experiences to their mental health conditions. Participants and setting: Young adult participants (n = 55; ages 25–30) who self-reported being diagnosed with an SMHC were recruited from one state in United States. In-person interviews were conducted to gather narratives related to mental health, education, training, and employment. Methods: Young adults with lived experience actively participated in the research process. Iterative coding and thematic analysis were employed to assess ACEs reported and analyze how participants described those experiences as influential. Results: Most participants identified as White, non-Hispanic women. Major depression and anxiety disorders were the most prevalent diagnoses. Over 80% reported experiencing trauma, familial mental illness, or substance use challenges. Young adults connected their ACEs to fear and anxiety, emotional processing difficulties, poor coping behaviors, delayed help-seeking, and later negative interpersonal relationships. Conclusions: This study is the first to qualitatively describe how young adults with SMHC describe ACEs and relate those experiences to their own mental health conditions. Future research should seek similar first-hand accounts in vulnerable populations and consider the unique impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings and future research can inform policy, practice, and mental health treatment for young adults who have experienced ACEs, especially in the post-pandemic era. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Purpose: Drug prevention programs typically focus on providing information on the effects of drugs and developing refusal skills. However, there is evidence that adolescents use substances to cope with stress. As such, integrating mental health literacy is important in prevention programs. The purpose of this study was to test a video-based mental health and substance prevention program for Filipino youth. Design/methodology/approach: The study used a cluster randomized trial and mixed methods design with 623 Filipino adolescents from 12 to 18 years old. The program consisted of six sessions focusing on stress, adaptive coping, effects of substances and drug refusal skills. It uses short psychoeducation videos along with self-reflection, and discussions to increase learner engagement. Findings: Results revealed a significant increase in knowledge and negative attitudes toward substance of participants in the intervention group compared to the control group. Those in the intervention group reported improved use of adaptive coping skills particularly cognitive reappraisal, social support, problem-solving and relaxation compared to the control group. Originality/value: This study adds to the literature on prevention from under-represented and non-Western contexts such as the Philippines. This study highlights how technology-mediated and integrated mental health and substance use programs can be useful in countries with few resources for mental health. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to outline what early support should be offered to children and young people with neurodevelopmental conditions including those who are autistic or have intellectual disability. A review of all child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) services in the Northwest completed by NHS England and Improvement (Doyle and Ryan, 2021) found that there was no clear Tier 2 offer (for mild to moderate mental health issues) for autistic children and young people or for those with intellectual disability. Following this review, a project group that had developed a model for mental health services for autistic children and young people and for those with intellectual disability (Wee et al., 2021) was tasked with articulating the “Getting Help” offer for children and young people with neurodevelopmental conditions, including intellectual disability. Design/methodology/approach: A working group was created consisting of professionals from mental health, education and local authority and lived experience representatives of coproduction partners. A brief review of the background literature was also conducted. Six meetings were held to create a framework for the “Getting Help” offer and to discuss what the offer should be based on professional expertise and lived experience. Findings: Recommendations for the Getting Help multi-agency offer included pre- and post-assessment support as part of a single attention deficit hyperactivity disorder/autism/neurodevelopmental pathway, community support for children with intellectual disability, access to adapted mental health support and the need for early recognition and support for avoidant and restrictive food intake disorder. Key themes from working group discussions included the reduction in the quality of services experienced by children and families due to silo working, which increased the risk of falling between multi-agency services and led to early signs of neurodevelopmental needs, or mental health issues being missed. Another theme was aiming for equity of access and outcomes. Originality/value: This work is a response to a coproduced review of CAMHS in the Northwest and incorporates the lived experience of young people and families. It also adopts a holistic multi-agency neurodevelopmental approach rather than focusing on a single diagnosis or service. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: While enhancing mental health literacy is a critical component of preventive mental health, there is currently no mental health literacy instrument specific to adolescents in Turkey. This study aimed to adapt the universal mental health literacy scale for adolescents (UMHL-A) to Turkish and determine its validity and reliability. Methods: This methodological study utilized data collected from 268 adolescents aged 10 to 14 years, between April and June 2024. Data were obtained using a personal information form and the UMHL-A. The construct validity of the scale was evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis, and its reliability was assessed with internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Results: The scale consists of two parts: the Likert UMHL-A, a five-point scale to determine adolescents' attitudes, and the T/F UMHL-A, a true/false scale to measure their knowledge. In this study, it was shown that the Likert UMHL-A, which includes 8 items and two factors, namely help-seeking and stigma, and the T/F UMHL-A, which consists 9 items and two factors namely mental health knowledge and mental illness knowledge, had good fit indices. The Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient was 0.934 for the Likert UMHL-A, and 0.862 for the T/F UMHL-A. The item-total score correlation coefficients of the Likert UMHL-A ranged between 0.582 and 0.856, whereas those of the T/F UMHL-A varied between 0.483 and 0.804. Conclusion: The Turkish version of the UMHL-A is a valid and reliable tool for assessing adolescents' mental health literacy. Implications for practice: Health professionals can use this brief and easy-to-apply instrument in clinical practices or educational programs to identify and improve adolescents' mental health literacy. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objective: Mental health diagnoses among adolescents are increasing in prevalence. Existing literature considers associations between individual-level social determinants of health (SDOH) and adolescent mental health. Neighborhood-level SDOH can have a substantial impact on health. This paper examines associations between neighborhood-level SDOH and mental health diagnoses of anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation among hospitalized adolescents. Methods: We used 2018 and 2019 Texas Inpatient Discharge Public Use Data Files linked to the zip-code level Child Opportunity Index 2.0, a composite measure of subdomains which characterize neighborhood-level SDOH, to examine rates of mental health diagnoses and associations with patient characteristics across opportunity level quintiles. Results: The sample included 50,011 adolescents ages 10–19 admitted to the hospital with the mental health diagnoses anxiety, depression, and/or suicide. Most had a single diagnosis; anxiety (12.9%), depression (37.5%), or suicide (13.0%). Hospitalized adolescents 10–14 years old were a plurality (44.2%) of the sample. Most adolescents were White (64.2%) and non-Hispanic (67.4%) and lived in rural areas (29.6%). Adolescents from racial minority populations and those in rural communities with mental health diagnoses had lower opportunity-levels. Higher opportunity levels were associated with greater odds of having an anxiety or suicide diagnosis while a depression diagnosis was associated with a lower opportunity-level. Conclusions: There are significant differences in adolescent mental health diagnoses associated with neighborhood opportunity-level. While all adolescents can benefit from mental health education, screening, and early interventions, additional resources tailored to neighborhood-level opportunity may prove a more meaningful way to improve population-level mental health outcomes. © 2024 Academic Pediatric Association

AB  - Suicide is a global public health issue which has far-reaching impacts on individuals, families, and wider communities. Early intervention is a core pillar of policy on the prevention of suicide related deaths. However, limited mental health literacy, and negative attitudes regarding mental illness amongst the public are a barrier to early intervention. Past research has not explored mental health literacy and attitudes regarding suicide specifically. The aim of the current study was to examine mental health literacy and attitudes towards suicide in adults. 590 adults in Ireland aged 18-80 years (M = 43.24, SD = 12.6) took part in this online cross-sectional study, completing the Mental Health Literacy Scale and The Attitudes Towards Suicide Scale. Experience of suicide deaths was common among participants. Independent t-tests indicated that males had significantly lower levels of mental health literacy and more stigmatising attitudes towards suicide than females. Young adults also had lower ability to recognise mental health difficulties than older adults. Hierarchical Multiple Regressions found that mental health literacy significantly accounted for varied attitudes towards suicide in adults, particularly willingness to communicate about suicide, and beliefs that suicide is preventable. Findings are discussed in the context of informing policy-makers who are promoting early-intervention for suicide prevention. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Adolescence is a critical period for mental health and social exclusion, a key social determinant of mental health. Early intervention approaches are key to mitigating the impact of mental ill-health during adolescence, however social exclusion can create additional barriers to accessing care. Aim: We aimed to better understand help-seeking experiences of adolescents facing co-occurring social exclusion and mental ill-health, including sources of support, barriers and preferences for service provision. Method: Cross-sectional data were analysed, from the 2022 Mission Australia Youth Survey (N = 18,800). Adolescents aged 15 to 19 years were recruited from around Australia, through schools, community organisations and digital platforms. Indices of four domains of social exclusion (housing, finances, relational and education/employment) were created using existing Youth Survey variables, and supplemented with demographic characteristics, psychological distress and help-seeking behaviours (perceived need, mental health supports, barriers to access and preferences). Relationships between social exclusion domains, mental health concerns and help-seeking behaviours were explored using logistic regression models. Results: A total of 9,743 young people reported having needed mental health support, yet only 58.1% reportedly sought support (n = 5,565). Social exclusion domains were associated with different help-seeking behaviours: housing challenges with higher help-seeking (OR = 1.28; 95% CI [1.15, 1.42]); relational difficulties and edu-employment issues with lower (OR = 0.75; 95% CI [0.68, 0.83] and OR = 0.82; 95% CI [0.75, 0.89]). Stigma, confidentiality concerns, cost and not knowing where to seek help were common barriers to help-seeking; those experiencing social exclusion more likely to report these. Participants reported a strong preference for face-to-face support. Conclusions: This study highlights the additional needs and challenges faced by adolescents dealing with both social exclusion and mental ill-health. With greater barriers to help-seeking, concerted efforts are needed to reduce stigma, improve mental health literacy and increase access to trusted information sources. Further initiatives should focus on structural factors that socially exclude young people and exacerbate inequitable access to mental healthcare. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Introduction: One in 5 adults in the United States have depression and are at risk for suicide, the 11th leading cause of death in the United States. Community pharmacy settings are ideal for increasing access to mental health services. Our objectives were to assess PHQ-9 scores and evaluate participant satisfaction in a student pharmacist–led depression screening program in a community pharmacy. Methods: Student pharmacists trained in mental health first aid recruited participants 18 to 90 years old in a community pharmacy to complete the PHQ-9 and provided mental health education, referrals, and resources. A 2-week follow-up was completed, and participants reported on actions taken since the initial visit. Descriptive statistics, independent t tests, and v2 tests were used in data analysis. Results: Twelve depression screening events were held, and 70 participants completed the screenings. The mean age was 52 years, and 75.7% were female. PHQ-9 scores ranged from 0 to 24 with an average of 3.96. Most participants (92.9%) reported the depression screening program was helpful. More than 90% of participants completed the 2-week follow-up, and 92.3% reported being comfortable seeking mental health services from a pharmacist. About half (53.8%) reported reading the educational materials, 24.6% helped a friend or family member, and 16.9% made an appointment with their health care provider. Discussion: Student pharmacists successfully provided depression screenings and mental health education in a community pharmacy. Most participants had low PHQ-9 scores, found the program helpful, and are willing to utilize mental health services in a community pharmacy. © 2024 AAPP.

AB  - Background Epidemiological evidence about the prevalence of adolescent mental health issues and their association with mental health literacy is crucial for sustained mental health promotion strategies. Adolescence is a critical life stage for mental health promotion. However, evidence is not available among Ethiopian school adolescents. Hence, the present study examined the prevalence of adolescents’ mental health issues and their correlation with mental health literacy. Materials and methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among adolescents (grades 5–12) in Dire Dawa city, Eastern Ethiopia using multistage random sampling. Data was collected using the Strength and Difficulty Questionnaire, WHO-5 well-being index, and mental health literacy questionnaire. SPSS version 25 was used for the descriptive, Chi-square, binary logistic regression, and correlation analyses. Results Between 14.0–24.5% of adolescents had reported mental health problems: internalizing problems (14.9–28.8%), emotional problems (10.4–25.5%), and peer relationship problems (17.8–25.5%). These mental health problems were significantly greater among adolescents who had either themselves or their family members used psychoactive substances (p≤0.05). Females from upper elementary (5–8 grade) and lower secondary (9–10) grade levels had a higher prevalence of mental health problems (AOR: 2.60 (0.95–7.10, p<0.05)). The effect of age, parental education, or employment status was insignificant (p>0.05). The prevalence of depression ranged from 18.0–25.5%. Mental health literacy was negatively correlated with total difficulties scores and positively associated with mental well-being scores (p<0.05). Conclusion The prevalence of adolescents’ mental health problems was higher. It implied that promoting mental health literacy could enhance adolescents’ positive mental health. Intervention programs should prioritize vulnerable groups and individuals reporting symptoms of mental health difficulties. Future studies should involve qualitative studies and consider effect of other determinants. © 2024 Hassen et al.

AB  - Mental health literacy (MHL) is an important part of the help-seeking process, yet there is a lack of knowledge about the MHL of adolescents in the Caribbean. This region is important to study as it is underrepresented in mental health research globally. The aim of this study is to explore the ability of adolescents in Bermuda to recognize depression and social phobia (social anxiety) and their beliefs about the sources of help for a peer with these mental health problems. This cross-sectional study surveyed middle and high school students aged 10-19 years in Bermuda. Online surveys conducted between November 2022 and June 2023 gathered demographic data including age, gender and race, and assessed the ability to recognize depression and social anxiety from descriptions provided in randomly assigned vignettes, and beliefs about sources of help. Across 15 middle and high schools, 2423 adolescents (out of 3593 eligible participants) completed all demographic and MHL survey questions (1139 males, 1272 females). Recognition rates for depression and social anxiety were 60% and 53%, respectively. Compared to females, males endorsed a greater variety of help sources. Reporting symptoms of depression or anxiety reduced the likelihood of endorsing multiple sources of help. MHL of adolescents in Bermuda is sub-optimal, particularly for social anxiety. Mental health promotion programs may be useful in improving recognition rates. © 2024 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press.

AB  - Background: Compared with the general population, prison inmates show a higher prevalence of mental disorders, particularly among those with childhood traumas. Despite childhood traumas being robust indicators of poor mental health, there is limited research on their relationship with prisoners' attitudes toward seeking psychological help. This study investigates the impact of childhood traumas on prisoners' attitudes toward help-seeking and self-stigmatization. Methods: This cross-sectional, explanatory study was conducted with 250 persons in prison. Data were collected using a sociodemographic information form, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, the Attitudes Toward Seeking Psychological Help Scale, and the Self-Stigma of Seeking Help Scale. Statistical analysis was performed using Spearman correlation test and multiple linear regression analysis with SPSS Version 28. Results: A significant link was found between childhood traumas and self-stigmatization in seeking psychological help. Positive attitudes toward help-seeking were significantly associated with increased self-stigmatization. Childhood traumas were significantly related to single-parent families, conflicted intrafamilial relationships, entering prison at the age of 19 years or older, mental health issues, and behavioral disorders. Moreover, a meaningful association was observed between self-stigmatization in help-seeking and being from a single-parent family with a low socioeconomic status. Conclusion: In conclusion, imprisoned persons with childhood traumas exhibit higher levels of self-stigmatization in seeking psychological help, contributing to negative attitudes. Recommendations for adequate access to mental health services in prisons include fostering a culture of psychological help, enhancing mental health literacy, providing trauma-informed care, and developing comprehensive strategies. In addition, the suggestion is made for the development of societal reintegration programs. © © 2024 International Association of Forensic Nurses.

AB  - Disparities in mental health care and access to care disproportionately affect youth from minoritized and low-income communities. School-based prevention programs have the potential to offer a non-stigmatized approach to mental health care as well as the ability to reach many students simultaneously. Advocates 4 All Youth (ALLY) is a program developed for 5-6th grade students aimed at improving self-efficacy and resilience via individualized sessions with a trusted adult (ALLYs). The feasibility of delivering ALLY in a racially and minoritized low-income community is discussed and modifications required to implement the program documented. Students completed questionnaires and sessions with an ALLY. Aspects of program delivery deemed feasible included training ALLYs to delivery program, stakeholder buy-in regarding missing class time, and students attending the sessions. Further modifications included adjustments to materials due to lower reading level and health literacy related-educational needs. Programs designed in one demographic setting may not work in a different setting. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - The mental health of youth with chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been increasingly recognized as an area of clinical need. The development of mental health concerns is influenced by a range of physiological, psychological, and environmental factors. Some of these factors are common across child development, but some are more unique to youth with CKD. Mental health concerns are associated with increased risk for a range of poor medical outcomes (e.g., adherence, risk of transplant rejection) and quality of life concerns. In this educational review, we discuss the current evidence base regarding the development of mental health concerns in youth with CKD. The review covers multiple domains including mood and anxiety disorders, traumatic stress, and neurodevelopmental disorders. Estimated prevalence and hypothesized risk factors are outlined, and the potential impact of mental health on medical care and functional outcomes are reviewed. Finally, we introduce options for intervention to support positive mental health and offer recommendations for building access to mental health care and improving the mental health education/training of medical professionals.

AB  - Resilience, the capacity to maintain or regain functionality in the face of adversity, is a dynamic process influenced by individual, familial, and community factors. Despite its variability, distinct resilience trajectories can be identified within populations, yet the predictors defining these distinct groups remains largely unclear. Here, using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ages 0-18), we quantify resilience as the remaining variance in psychosocial functioning after taking into account the exposure to adversity. Growth mixture modeling identified seven distinct resilience trajectories, with over half of the study population maintaining resilience throughout early life. Factors increasing the likelihood of resilient trajectory membership included a less emotional temperament, high cognitive abilities, high self-esteem, low levels of autistic social traits, strong sibling relationships, high maternal care, and positive school experiences. Among the socioeconomic factors considered, maternal education - a significant indicator of socioeconomic status - and birth-order were associated with resilient trajectories. Our findings underscore the importance of fostering cognitive abilities, self-esteem, social relationships, positive school experiences, and extracurricular engagement to bolster resilience in adversity-exposed individuals and communities. This research informs resilience-focused interventions in mental health, education, and social policy sectors, and prompts further exploration of socioeconomic influences on resilience trajectories. © The Author(s), 2023.

AB  - This study aims to analyze the effect of psychological health based on artificial intelligence agent technology on the implementation effect of Japanese family education. By combining mobile agent technology and education thought, the system structure and working mechanism of the education support system of agents are studied to build personalized support for the family education system based on mobile agents. A total of 320 Japanese middle school students were randomly divided into an experimental group and a control group, with 160 cases in each group. The control group received traditional family health education, while the experimental group received mental health education based on the Agent Technology family education system. The basic information and mental health scores of the two groups of students were compared. The results showed that there were no remarkable differences in the number of male and female cases, weight, height, average age, grade, home address, or family situation between groups (p > 0.05). The psychological health level of the experimental group was considerably superior to that of the control group regarding obsessional symptoms, interpersonal tension and sensitivity, depression, anxiety, learning pressure, maladaptation, emotional imbalance, and psychological imbalance (p < 0.05). In summary, compared with traditional family education, family education of the mental health education system based on agent technology can better improve the level of middle school students’ mental health, which can improve student forced symptoms, interpersonal tension and sensitivity, depression, anxiety, learning pressure, maladjustment, emotional imbalance, psychological imbalance, and many other psychological states. Furthermore, personalized support for family education systems based on mobile agents has the advantages of autonomy, responsiveness, initiative, and mobility, which provides a new idea for family education. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.

AB  - Mental health difficulties affect children and adolescents pervasively. School counsellors serve as frontliners to support the students in need, but often face challenges from the complexity of their cases. This study aims to develop a training module named MDAS (Mental Health disorder, Developmental disorders, Attachment and Self-compassionate) program to improve the school counsellors’ mental health knowledge and counselling self-efficacy. The Module was adapted from Child and Adolescent Mental Health Training Module for Specialist 2009 (Second Edition). The study adopted a one group pre-test/post-test design to assess 28 school counsellors at 0-month and 4-month after the training. The scales used were Counselling Self-Efficacy scale (COSE), Mental Health Literacy Scale (MHLS) and Self-Compassionate Scale – Short Form (SCS-SF). Post-training, there were significant increment of COSE and MHLS scores (p <.001 and p <.046) with Cohen’s d of 1.01 and 0.58. Four of the COSE subscales (micro skills, counselling process, cultural competence and dealing with difficult clients’ behaviour) significantly increased after MDAS training (p <.001, p =.006, p =.001 and p =.01). In addition to increasing the counselling capacity of school counsellors, our training module can serve as a promising platform for mental health professionals and counsellors. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Mental health literacy (MHL) is one of the most important factors in resolving mental health disorders for adolescents. This cross-sectional study examines the level of MHL among secondary school students and seeks to determine its predictors. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to recruit a sample of 404 students with a mean age of 14.89 years (SD = 1.66) attending an autonomous secondary school in Nakhon Pathom province, Thailand in the first semester of the 2023 academic year. The research instruments were two self-reporting questionnaires, namely the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ – Thai version) and the Mental Health Literacy Survey. Content validity was reviewed by three experts and the Index of Consistency (IOC) was 0.97, with Cronbach’s alpha reliabilities of 0.94 (GHQ), and 0.75 (MHL). Descriptive statistics including chi-square test and binary logistic regression were used to analyze the data. The mean score of MHL was 28.96 (SD = 3.58), indicating adequate MHL within this sample. Academic performance (OR 1.834, 95%Cl 1.139-2.954), studying at the senior high school level (OR 1.559, 95%Cl 1.005-2.418), and experiencing psychological distress (OR.535, 95%Cl .321-.892) were all predictors of adequate MHL. These findings suggest that school administrations and healthcare providers should develop a program to ensure junior-level students attain cognitive abilities and an adequate MHL level to prevent future mental illness. © 2024, Mahidol University - ASEAN Institute for Health Development.

AB  - Objective: Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) is an international, early intervention, public education program that teaches participants to identify, understand, and respond to signs of mental health and substance use challenges. Until now, all evaluations on MHFA courses in the United States have been performed externally, which have limits in generalizability and the ability to address insights in a timely manner. Additionally, few evaluations have assessed the newest versions of MHFA courses. Therefore, this evaluation aimed to understand key outcomes and participant responses to Adult and Youth MHFA courses in a nationwide sample, spanning nearly a year of real-world implementation. Methods: An internal, mixed methods program evaluation was performed on the second edition of the in-person versions of Adult and Youth MHFA. Pre- and post-course evaluation data from 3,586 Adult and 2,314 Youth MHFA participants trained between October 2022 and July 2023 were used in this evaluation. Key quantitative constructs, such as mental health literacy, intentions to perform MHFA skills, and confidence to use MHFA skills, were analyzed using paired sample t tests. Rapid thematic analysis methods were used to analyze participants' qualitative responses to the course. Results: Significant increases in mental health literacy, intentions, and confidence were observed in both Adult and Youth MHFA participants from pre- to post-course. Qualitative analyses revealed key themes in participant responses, including the helpfulness of the activities, materials, and the MHFA action plan. Adjustments to materials, the length or pace of the course, and other specifics were noted as opportunities for improvement. These findings will be used to inform the future practice, implementation, and revisions of MHFA. Conclusion: Completion of Adult or Youth MHFA by adults in the United States led to improvements in mental health literacy and intentions and confidence to assist someone in need. Both programs may benefit from implementation and content-related changes to enhance participant experience. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - While Singapore is celebrated for its world-class economy and education system, it still grapples with mental health challenges among young people, highlighting the urgent need for early intervention and effective treatment for this population. Hence, this systematic review aimed to identify mental health interventions for young people aged 10 to 24 in Singapore. Databases including PubMed, CINAHL Complete, APA PsycArticles, APA PsycInfo, and Scopus were searched until September 23, 2023, resulting in the identification of five studies (N = 397) conducted between 2017 and 2023. They were analysed following the latest Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline, with the risk of bias and levels of evidence assessed. The studies covered diverse populations ranging from students to youth offenders, addressing various mental health concerns such as autism spectrum disorder, anxiety, social withdrawal, and mental health literacy. While three studies reported positive outcomes but two of them too raised concerns about measurement validity, intervention rigor, and sample size. Overall, the review revealed significant heterogeneity in both intervention outcomes and delivery methods among mental health interventions for young people in Singapore, making comparisons challenging and definitive conclusions difficult to draw. Additionally, the review underscored the scarcity of published interventions for this demographic, highlighting the urgent need for more tailored and evidence-based approaches. Nonetheless, it emphasizes the importance of addressing this gap and advocates for more research to inform evidence-based practices and policies, providing valuable insights for mental health professionals, policymakers, and researchers aiming to enhance the well-being of Singapore’s young population. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Objectives: The prevalence of self-harm and the potential link with suicidal ideation highlights the need to prepare future physiotherapists to deal with the potentially catastrophic outcomes to which a lack of understanding in this area can lead. The aim of this research was to investigate if final year physiotherapy students felt prepared to assess risk of suicide or self-harm following patient disclosure, or showing signs of intention to harm themselves. Design: An interpretive phenomenological methodology (IPA) was implemented to aid in the understanding and interpretation of participants’ own experiences. In conjunction with the overarching design, semi-structured interviews, via two focus groups, were used to explore participants' views. Setting: Focus groups were conducted via an online platform. Participants: Purposive sampling was employed as a sampling method to recruit final year physiotherapy students. The final sample consisted of ten participants. Results: Four main themes were identified: Experiences of disclosure; Encountering mental health; Lack of mental health education, and Lack of knowledge regarding policy and procedure. Conclusions: The findings highlight a deficit with regards to the preparedness of final year students in dealing with disclosure to self-harm. A lack of both formal education regarding mental illness and of practice experience in the field of mental health contribute to this. Therefore, a more rigorous and directed approach to education regarding mental illness is essential. Furthermore, involvement in mental health practice placements would allow for a greater level of experiential learning and understanding of the issues faced by those living with mental illness. Contribution of the paper: Contribution to the evidence: • This paper supports existing literature that physiotherapy training falls short in its treatment of mental health related issues. • This shortfall is twofold; relating to gaps in both formal educational settings and practice placements. Contribution to knowledge: • Participants highlighted clear deficits in knowledge of the relevant policies and procedures concerning disclosure to self-harm. • Overall there was a feeling of unpreparedness for dealing with such issues in practice. © 2024 Chartered Society of Physiotherapy

AB  - Go plays a very prominent role in quality education and mental health education. Go can cultivate character, make friends, improve interpersonal relationships, and promote mental health. To apply it to mental health and emotional regulation, the AlphaGo series algorithms are analyzed. To address the unstable deep reinforcement learning training, low training data utilization, model sensitivity to hyper-parameters, and heavy parameter tuning burden, the algorithm is optimized by combining ensemble learning and advanced deep reinforcement learning. Then, the weighted voting method is applied to the selection step of sub nodes in the Monte Carlo tree search process. At the same time, asynchronous parallelization improvements are implemented to improve the efficiency of the Monte Carlo tree search algorithm. Finally, a board game based on ensemble learning and improved Monte Carlo tree search algorithm is obtained. Through experimental analysis, the average winning rate of the system was 93.36 %. The number of users who were very satisfied with the game was 83.96 %. After intervention, the depression and anxiety scores of the experimental group students were significantly lower than the control group (P < 0.05). The designed game can effectively alleviate user anxiety and depression, providing new ideas for the psychotherapy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The literature to date has documented the presence of challenges and barriers in mental health systems and services for children and adolescents worldwide. However, studies addressing this reality often do so in a fragmented, residual, incomplete, or generalized way, therefore hindering a comprehensive understanding of this complex phenomenon. The aim of this qualitative systematic review is to analyze the barriers and challenges affecting global mental health care for children and adolescents. Searches were made in the Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed databases between 2018 and 2022 using terms connected with mental health, childhood, adolescence, and health systems. The search resulted in the extraction of 9075 articles, of which 51 were considered eligible for inclusion and complied with quality indicators. A number of closely related structural, financial, attitudinal, and treatment barriers that limited the quality of life and well-being of children and adolescents with mental health needs were found. These barriers included inadequate public policies, operational deficiencies, insufficient insurance coverage, privatization of services, stigma, lack of mental health literacy, lack of training, overburdened care, dehumanization of care, and lack of community and integrated resources. The analysis of these barriers displays that this treatment gap reflects the historical injustice towards mental illness and the disregard for real needs in these crucial stages, perpetuating a systematic lack of protection for the mental health of children and adolescents. The complexity of the disorders and the absence of public resources have resulted in a hodgepodge of mental health services for children and adolescents that fails to provide the continuing specialist health care they need. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Reviews into universal interventions to improve help seeking in young people focus on specific concepts, such as behaviour, do not differentiate between interpersonal and intrapersonal help seeking, and often report on statistical significance, rather than effect size. The aim of this review was to address the gaps highlighted above, to investigate the impact of universal, school-based interventions on help-seeking in children and young people, as well as to explore longer term impact. Four databases were searched. Data were extracted on country of origin, design, participant, school, and intervention characteristics, the help-seeking concept measured (e.g. knowledge, attitude/intention, behaviour), the duration between baseline and each follow-up (if applicable) and effect sizes at each follow-up. Quality assessment of the studies was undertaken using the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) quality assessment tool. Overall, 14 different interventions met inclusion criteria. The majority of the studies were rated low in the quality assessment. Three constructs were most frequently reported a) intrapersonal attitudes towards help-seeking, b) interpersonal attitudes towards help-seeking and c) intrapersonal intended help-seeking. Findings around intervention effect were mixed. There was tentative evidence that interventions impacting interpersonal attitudes produced small effect sizes when measured between 3 and 6 months post intervention and that when effect sizes were initially observed intrapersonal attitudes, this remained at 3–6 month follow-up. Further work should pay attention to implementation factors, understanding the core ingredients needed to deliver effective interventions and whether embedding mental health education could help sustain or top up effect sizes from help-seeking interventions. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - This final chapter draws together the key findings presented in the preceding pages and considers emergent conclusions and implications for mental health and wellbeing in schools. The author draws upon the evidence presented by the book's eclectic range of contributors and the health promoting schools' (HPSs) framework to provide a road map of what an effective whole school approach (WSA) might look like moving forward. Crucially, lessons from recent crises in education, including COVID-19-driven changes in pathways to support, are highlighted as pivotal factors in a future vision which sees schools as an effective and sustainable frontline force to help tackle the global burden of child and adolescent mental health through a proactive, preventive stance. With this future focus in mind, next steps are considered in terms of developing effective and sustainable mental health and wellbeing support for all within healthy school settings. © 2024 The authors.

AB  - School nurses play a key role in supporting student mental health, and many school nurses report the need for additional mental health education. The Mental Health Training Intervention for Health Providers in Schools (MH-TIPS) is a training and implementation support system for school nurses to enhance their skills in promoting student mental health. The current study evaluated the feasibility of the MH-TIPS online curriculum for school nurses, and its impact on their preparedness and ability to support student mental health. Participants included 1,282 registered nurses and nurse practitioners. Descriptive statistics indicated that MH-TIPS online was feasible, relevant, and accessible for school nurses and helped them support student mental health. School nurses reported significant improvements in their preparedness to conduct brief mental health interventions with students and motivate students to seek help. MH-TIPS online is a promising tool to increase the ability of school nurses to support student mental health. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Background: Adolescents’ mental health can have significant effects on their well-being; Inadequate Mental Health Literacy (MHL) is also a global concern. The present study investigated Mental Health Literacy and its relationship with positive mental health in Iranian adolescents. Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed in Saveh, a city in the center of Iran, between April 15, 2023 to May 25, 2023. A total number of 400 adolescents in 8 schools were selected through a multi-stage cluster sampling technique. Mental health literacy and positive mental health were measured using the Mental Health Literacy Questionnaire (KAMHS) and the 14-item Mental Health Continuum Short Form (MHC-SF) questionnaire. The parameters linked to mental health literacy were found using a hierarchical multiple linear regression model. SPSS version 22 was used to analyze the data. Results: The study results revealed that approximately half of the participants (52.5%) had moderate mental health. The mean and standard deviation of mental health literacy scores were 89 and 8.7, respectively. Gender (P=0.041), father’s level of education (P=0.043), mother’s level of education (P=0.031), father’s employment status (P=0.023), family income (P=0.035), familiarity with those with mental illness (P=0.01), and mental health status (P=0.005) were associated with mental health literacy. Also, results indicated significant differences in MHL (P=0.01) and good mental health behaviors (P=0.04), avoidance coping (P=0.03), and knowledge (P<0.001). Conclusions: It is essential to implement suitable educational programs to improve the mental health status and mental health literacy of adolescents. The mental health status of individuals can act as a catalyst in promoting mental health literacy. © 2024, International Journal of School Health.

AB  - Background: Neurodiversity is increasingly discussed in relation to autism research and practice. However, there is a lack of scholarship concerning the neurodevelopmental condition of Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) and the neurodiversity movement. While this movement may hold opportunities for the DLD community, the application of the concept of neurodiversity to DLD research and practice needs consideration, as DLD and autism have very different levels of public and professional awareness and understanding. Aims: In this article, we discuss what the concept of neurodiversity and the associated neurodiversity movement could mean for DLD research and practice. We aim to critique some assumptions that may arise from the application of neurodiversity principles (or assumed principles) to the field of DLD. Methods: This is a discussion paper, drawing on the personal experiences and reflections of the author team. Main Contributions: We make the case for why DLD should be included in discussions about neurodivergence and outline considerations for doing so, and why some issues and applications may be particular to DLD. We outline points of similarity and contrast with autism in relation to our understanding of neurodiversity. We consider the issues around diagnosis and terminology and urge practitioners to continue to diagnose DLD using currently agreed terminology, so as not to undermine recent awareness efforts. We note that a neurodiversity-informed perspective challenges us to offer interventions that operate at the level of our environments, not just at the level of an individual. Indeed, neurodiversity offers a platform to argue for better rights and more inclusive spaces in mental health settings, education and work for children and adults with DLD. Conclusions: DLD should be considered from a neurodiversity-informed perspective, and it is our hope that this will lead to neurodiversity-affirming practice that will afford young people with DLD better understanding from members of the public and the professionals who work with them. Further work is needed to better support children, young people and adults with DLD to have a voice in the neurodiversity movement. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: What is already known on the subject Neurodiversity approaches are increasingly being taken up in research and practice in relation to autism, meaning that our understanding of autism and how autistic people are supported is increasingly drawing on the principles of neurodiversity. However, autism is not the only neurodivergent population. Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) is another neurodevelopmental condition; however, relative to autism, DLD has lower awareness amongst professionals and the public. There has been no scholarship that has examined DLD through the lens of neurodiversity, or considered the application of neurodiversity-affirming approaches to DLD. What this paper adds to existing knowledge In this paper, we examine what the neurodiversity movement means for DLD research and practice. In particular, we consider what neurodiversity in the field of autism might teach us about the application of neurodiversity in the field of DLD, and highlight where we believe there are important differences between the two populations. We reflect on what neurodiversity means for intervention, diagnosis, terminology and championing the need for accessibility, especially with regard to mental health support, education and employment. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? Neurodiversity highlights the need to consider interventions at the level of an individual's environment (e.g., how can we make this space more inclusive?) as well as interventions operating at the level of the individual themselves (e.g., interventions focusing on an individual's language skills). We challenge the notion that neurodiversity-affirming approaches mean not diagnosing DLD or changing DLD's terminology: we argue that this is not in the spirit of the original neurodiversity movement, but also that for a condition with such low public awareness, these actions could do more harm than good for families affected by DLD. We call for more in-depth scholarship and discussion around the application of neurodiversity approaches to DLD and argue that the neurodiversity movement offers an important opportunity to raise better awareness and understanding of DLD in multiple sectors, including (but not limited to) mental health, education and employment. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Preventing the development of criminal potential in young people is an important component of broader crime reduction strategies. A key feature of developmental crime prevention is a comprehensive effort to improve the life chances of at-risk children and families, and there is evidence that doing so improves long-term life-course outcomes like physical health, mental health, education, and employment. We assess available research evidence from 12 high-quality studies of developmental crime prevention initiatives and find that extensive use of multimodal interventions helps to foster cumulative protection over the life course, that there are significant improvements in other outcomes over the life course, that there are promising signs of intergenerational transmission of the intervention effects, and that there is strong support for these sorts of interventions from the perspective of benefit-cost analysis. We also discuss implications for public policy and research. © 2025 by The American Academy of Political and Social Science.

AB  - Even in this post-pandemic world, it cannot be overlooked that the global community has yet to fully recover from the long-term mental impacts of the pandemic and its associated challenges. Among these, the shift to remote learning and isolated lives has significantly affected students' mental health. While it is widely discussed that engineering students are more prone to mental health conditions, investigating the mental well-being of students specializing in Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) is also critical. This research focuses on examining the stress levels and identifying key factors contributing to stress, such as academic workload, anxieties related to job searches, and concerns over future professional prospects. In our previous research, we also highlighted the significance of mental health challenges among engineering students. Our previous study recommended integrating mental health resources into the engineering curriculum, particularly for civil and construction students [1]. Building on our prior research, this study aims to assess stress levels and explore the relationships between various stressors and demographic variables among AEC students. Following Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, this study distributed the developed questionnaires to 74 AEC students. The study categorized stressors into three distinct groups: “Personal/family-related stressors”, “Academic-related stressors”, and “Industry/work-related stressors”. Aligned with the study's objectives, the research customized and utilized the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4), comprising 10 questions for each group, to measure stress levels among the participants. This study underlines the importance of addressing mental health in AEC education, revealing personal and family-related stressors as primary concerns for students. It highlights the critical role of communication skills and the need for gender-sensitive approaches in mental health education. It suggests incorporating mental health topics into the curriculum, as recommended by students, to address stressors effectively and improve preparedness for workplace challenges. This approach aims to foster a resilient future workforce, ready to handle the professional environment's demands. Future research should build upon these findings, broadening the scope to include a wider range of engineering disciplines and engaging diverse stakeholders. This expanded approach aims to refine and enhance mental health support, leading to a more comprehensive and impactful curriculum for engineering students. While this study aims to understand the aforementioned stressors and their relationship with demographic factors, the study also endeavors to pave the way for future development of tailored mental health programs for the targeted group. The long-term goal is to enhance resilience, improve mental well-being skills, and encourage help-seeking behaviors among future AEC students and entry-level engineers. This will also help future engineers to communicate effectively and tolerate the world of industry. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024.

AB  - Mental health services are under unprecedented pressure with overwhelming referrals and a current waiting list of 1.2 million people of all ages. The cross-government White Paper ‘No health without mental health’ was launched 12 years ago detailing the importance of wellbeing services in the creation of mentally healthy communities through health promotion and illness prevention. While primary care, community services and psychiatry are pivotal in the treatment of mental Illness/disorder, mental health care per se is on a continuum, and a great deal of work can be undertaken in communities by wellbeing services to prevent avoidable referrals. This paper proposes a broad framework of education and training for wellbeing/positive mental health services, primary and community care, and nurses working in Community Mental Health Treatment Teams and Home Treatment Teams to ensure all those working with potentially vulnerable adults and children are regulated and meet national standards for mandatory mental health education and training. © 2024 MA Healthcare.

AB  - Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to inadequate provision of mental health and addictions care, as services have been traditionally conceptualized to serve the needs of children or adults. Additionally, rural communities have been largely excluded from research investigating mental healthcare access and exhibit unique barriers that warrant targeted interventions. Finally, perspectives from the target population will be most important when understanding how to optimize adolescent mental health and addictions care. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify what adolescents in a rural town perceive as barriers to accessing mental health services. We conducted a cross-sectional survey study with high school students to generate ranked lists of the top perceived individual-level, community-level, and overall barriers. A total of 243 high school students responded to the survey. Perceived barriers were predominantly at the community level. Overall, the top barriers reported were a lack of awareness and education regarding mental health, resources, and the nature of treatment. Students who had previously accessed mental health services identified primary barriers related to mental health professionals, whereas students who had not accessed care reported fear and uncertainty as primary barriers. Modifiable community-level factors related to (1) mental health literacy and (2) mental healthcare professionals were identified by adolescents as the main perceived barriers to accessing mental health and addiction services in a rural town. The findings of this preliminary study should inform intervention strategies and further rigorous research for this traditionally underserved target population. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Background: From the age of 14, many adolescents enter a vulnerable developmental phase, with a sharp increase in mental illness at 16. The COVID19 pandemic has further exacerbated this issue. Hence, universal and easily accessible prevention in the young is needed. E-mental health interventions are on the rise due to numerous benefits such as potential low-costs, low-threshold and high scalability. However, effectiveness and acceptance of mobile health (mHealth) preventive interventions remain unresearched. Method: In a two-armed, randomised controlled study design adolescents and young adults from 14 years old will be recruited. Following an initial baseline assessment, they will be randomised to a) the intervention group (IG, n = 75), which will receive a mHealth intervention (the application ‘Mental Health Guide’, co-developed by lived experience experts) or b) the waiting list control group (CG, n = 75). Both groups will be followed up after 3 and 6 months following post assessment. We hypothesize an increase in mental health literacy in the IG compared to the CG for post and follow-up assessment (primary outcome: Mental Health Literacy Scale). In addition, we expect an improvement in mental health and psychological well-being, improved emotion regulation, reduced psychological distress, as well as good quality ratings in usability and acceptance in the use of the ‘Mental Health Guide’ We performed multiple simulations of possible outcome scenarios, incorporating an array of factors, to generate realistic datasets and obtain accurate estimates of statistical power. Conclusion: As a first-of-its-kind in this field, this study investigates whether a mHealth intervention based on mental health literacy may improve the mental health literacy and further aspects of psychological functioning of young people in a vulnerable phase. Furthermore, the results promise to provide important knowledge of how universal prevention may be implemented with low costs for diverse populations. Trial registration: This trial was registered in the DRKS register (DRKS-ID: DRKS00031810) on 23 June 2023. © 2024

AB  - Aim: This study aimed to examine levels of mental health literacy (MHL) and associated factors among adolescents. Methods: A descriptive, cross-sectional, analytical study was conducted with a total of 650 students aged 11–18 years in three middle and three high schools. Data were collected using the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Literacy Scale and evaluated using descriptive statistics and regression analysis to determine whether age, gender, and grade are predictive factors of MHL. Results: The mean age of the participants in the study was 16.8 ± 1.35 years, 55 % of the students were girls, and the mean MHL score was 3.96 ± 1.2, indicating moderate MHL. Multiple regression analysis indicated that the variables of age, gender, and grade explained 5.5 % of the variance in MHL score. When these variables were examined individually, gender and grade had no significant effect (p > 0.05), while older age was associated with higher MHL score (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The results of this study showed that MHL improved with age. MHL promotion is important in mental health resilience. Collaboration between school nurses, school counselors, and psychiatric nurses to provide mental health educational interventions may help reduce stigma and increase help-seeking behaviors. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Mental health challenges are widespread among adolescents undergoing significant physical, emotional, social, and academic changes. However, rates of formal help-seeking remain low, particularly among those from ethnic minorities. Aims: This study investigated the determinants of intentions to seek formal mental health help among Palestinian adolescents in Israel, focusing on mental health literacy (MHL) and trust in formal sources of information. Methods: A total of 178 adolescents (Mage = 16.24 ± 1.24 years, 61.8% female) completed measures assessing intention for formal help-seeking, psychological distress, MHL, trust in formal sources of information, sociodemographic, and clinical characteristics. Results: Findings revealed low levels of intention to seek formal help and psychological distress, alongside average or above-average levels on all MHL dimensions and trust in formal sources for information. Our analysis identified socioeconomic status (β =.17, p <.05), psychological distress (β =.18, p <.05), trust in formal sources of information (β =.28, p <.001), and two MHL dimensions: knowledge of where to seek information (β =.25, p <.01) and attitudes that promote recognition or appropriate help-seeking behavior (β =.16, p <.05) – as the main determinants of intention for formal help-seeking. Conclusions: This study underscores the critical role of trust in formal sources of information and MHL in seeking formal help among adolescents from ethnic minorities. Interventions aiming to improve access to mental health-related information, address and enhance attitudes, and foster trust in formal professionals and institutions may contribute to an increased tendency for formal mental health help-seeking among this population and others. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The high prevalence of mental health problems and underutilization of mental health treatment are more severe among the Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander (NHPI) populations and remain misunderstood and understudied. Examining mental health literacy (MHL) – the knowledge and beliefs about mental disorders – aids their recognition, management, or prevention – has been shown to identify barriers to seeking and receiving care. This study aimed to assess the level of MHL in NHPIs and identify associated demographic variables. Data for this cross-sectional study were collected from 298 US NHPIs via an online questionnaire of the Mental Health Literacy Scale (MHLS). The overall mean MHLS score was 121 (SD = 17.3), with statistically significant higher scores in female participants, >31 years old, Tongan, more educated, and with higher income. This study demonstrated that overall MHL is comparable among NHPI compared to the current literature. However, NHPI men ≤30 years old and with lower income had lower MHL, which may be linked to the mental health disparities specific to this population. Current interventions should focus on increasing knowledge of risk factors, causes, self-treatments, and available professional help regarding mental disorders. Efforts to improve the MHL of NHPI should target men ≤30 years with lower income (<$50 000). © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

AB  - This pilot study assessed the acceptability and feasibility of the PROviding ACcess To InnoVative & Evidence-Based Intervention (PROACTIVE) Family Navigator Program for foster parents of children with mental health needs. Foster parents (n = 7) participated in four video conference sessions with a family navigator over the course of one month. In this study, family navigators were psychology doctoral students with mental health training. Feasibility and acceptability were measured with post-session surveys completed by family navigators and participants as well as a participant-completed survey following completion of the program. Feasibility and acceptability were both found to be excellent. Foster parents provided very positive satisfaction ratings for all aspects of the program. This pilot study provided preliminary support for the feasibility and acceptability of the PROACTIVE Family Navigator Program. With the experienced gained in this pilot work, we will design a randomized controlled trial with a fully powered sample to evaluate the efficacy of this program on building foster parent capacity to manage their child's mental health needs. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has wrought a profound impact on mental health in Sub- Saharan Africa, exacerbating existing disparities and rendering individuals undergoing treatment particularly susceptible. This comprehensive critical review delves into the scope, nature, and extent of COVID-19 impact on mental health services in Sub- Saharan Africa, while concurrently elucidating pivotal lessons and exemplary practices learnt from periods of lockdown. Methods: The methodology was guided by Jesson & Laccy's guide on how to conduct critical literature reviews. Articles were comprehensively sought through two academic databases (PubMed and Google Scholar), complemented by targeted searches on the WHO website and official public health websites of relevant Sub-Saharan African countries. Results: The investigation reveals a surge in mental health challenges, notably marked by a significant escalation in anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Disruptions to care services, financial hardships, and the pervasive effects of social isolation further compound this escalation. The pre-existing inequalities in access to and quality of care were accentuated during this crisis, with marginalized groups encountering heightened impediments to essential services. In navigating this unprecedented challenge, communities emerged as integral agents in establishing supportive networks and implementing culturally sensitive interventions. Technology, such as telemedicine and online resources, played a pivotal role in bridging access gaps, particularly in remote areas. The synthesis of best practices for supporting mental health patients during lockdowns encompasses targeted interventions for vulnerable groups, including adolescents and pregnant women. Empowering communities through economic support and mental health literacy programs was identified as crucial. The integration of technology, such as the development of robust telemedicine frameworks, virtual training in curricula, and the utilization of digital platforms for interventions and public messaging, emerged as a cornerstone in addressing access disparities. Community engagement and resilience-building strategies gained prominence, emphasizing the necessity of collaboration between healthcare providers and communities. Promotion of peer support groups, home-based care, and the preservation of traditional healing practices were underscored as essential components. Conclusion: The study underscores the need to adapt and optimize mental health services during emergencies. This entails prioritizing mental health within emergency response frameworks, exploring alternative service delivery methods, and fortifying data collection and research efforts. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Background: There is little evidence on the association between patterns of unhealthy lifestyle and mental health among young adults. Method: This study included a total of 28,978 young adults aged 18 to 44 years old in Guangdong province in south China, which was conducted from September to December in 2022. We used latent class analysis to classify the patterns of unhealthy lifestyle among young adults and used multiple logistic regression to explore their associations with depressive and anxiety symptoms. Result: The weighted prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms were 28.0 % and 19.5 %, respectively. The cumulative effect of unhealthy lifestyles on depressive and anxiety symptoms was significant. Five patterns of unhealthy lifestyle were classified. Compared to the relatively healthy lifestyle class, the class with more unhealthy lifestyles (OR = 6.54, 95 % CI: 5.70–7.51) and insufficient sleep (OR = 6.16, 95 % CI: 4.92–7.70) had higher risk for depressive and anxiety symptoms. Meaningfully, having adequate mental health literacy could reduce the risk of depressive and anxiety symptoms from unhealthy lifestyle by half. Limitations: The cross-section design study limited causal inferences, and the self-report information may lead to recall bias. Conclusions: Unhealthy lifestyles have a negative impact on depressive and anxiety symptoms through independent, cumulative and combined effects, and they could be interrelated. Unhealthy lifestyle patterns differed in younger population by socio-demographic characteristics and mental health literacy. Health-care professionals and policymakers may provide programs to intervene multiple unhealthy lifestyles and improve mental health literacy by integrating healthy lifestyle education to promote youngers' mental health. © 2024

AB  - Over the last decade, there has been a growing interest in mental health literacy (MHL) in health promotion, largely motivated by increased awareness of MHL as a modifiable determinant of mental health. Accordingly, MHL has been associated with the health-promoting school approach emerging over the last 20 years. To succeed in promoting MHL, it is of vast importance to evaluate working strategies and interventions to address MHL using validated instruments. The current study describes the revision and psychometric testing of a modified version of the 10-item adolescents’ positive MHL measure, the MHPK-10, the only identified instrument measuring adolescents’ positive MHL. The MHPK-10 was adjusted to address the previously documented ceiling effects and was further optimized for use in schools by reworking it to measure learning rather than self-reported knowledge, becoming the new nine-item Mental Health Learning Scale (MHLS-9). The MHLS-9 was tested on a national sample of N = 2,012 Norwegian ninth graders. Data were analyzed by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and tests of reliability and validity. The revised CFA model for the MHLS-9 showed an improved fit over the original CFA model for the MHPK-10. The MHLS-9s’ CFA model revealed excellent factor determinacy (.95) and scale reliability (ω =.91). Thus, the MHLS-9 is an improved measure for the positive component of MHL for use in school settings, enabling researchers and practitioners to evaluate and focus positive MHL interventions in schools using a short, reliable, and valid measure for adolescents’ learning about the factors promoting good mental health. © 2023 Society for Public Health Education.

AB  - This study investigated factors that impacted the mental health of secondary school students in Thailand. This cross-sectional study included 1,560 participants from six class levels in six public schools in Thailand. The survey instruments included the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale, Perceived Stress Scale, Short Grit Scale, Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version, and the Rosenberg’s Self-Esteem Scale. For secondary school adolescents, results indicated that Grit, Self-esteem, and smartphone addiction were significant predictors of stress (R2 =.46); self-esteem and smartphone addiction significantly predicted depression (R2 =.39); girls have significantly higher levels of depression, stress, smartphone addiction, and higher GPA than boys; and girls have significantly lower levels of self-esteem and grit than boys. Recommendations include strengthening parental involvement and supportive relationships among secondary school adolescents, which could help to reduce smartphone addiction and mental health problems. Additionally, implementing mental health literacy and intervention programs at schools could help to spread awareness, reduce stigma, improve resiliency, and boost self-esteem. © 2024, Mahidol University Faculty of Public Health.

AB  - Even though there is a large frequency of mental health issues among adolescents all over the world, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the mental health literacy of this demographic, particularly in economically developing nations. Literacy in mental health is necessary for the early diagnosis and treatment of mental illnesses before they become severe. The objectives of this study are to investigate the mental health literacy of students, the causes of mental illness, the disparities between genders, the reasons for mental disorders, and the variations between grade and causes of mental illnesses. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and an independent sample t-test were utilized to analyze the data. It was shown that environmental factors were the most significant contributors to mental illness. Furthermore, there was a substantial disparity between the degree of spirituality and the gender of the individual. Moreover, it was demonstrated that there are substantial distinctions between grade and environmental and biological factors. These findings have significant repercussions for educational initiatives that aim to promote students' mental health literacy at the high school level. Among the Vietnamese high school population, there is a demand for programs that teach pupils about mental health literacy. Literacy in mental health serves as the basis for mental health promotion, prevention, and care, with the primary goal of enhancing mental health and its associated outcomes. © 2024 Conscientia Beam.

AB  - Effective school-based mental health promotion and prevention interventions in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) can positively impact the mental health and well-being of large numbers of young people. This scoping review aimed to investigate the implementation of effective mental health promotion and prevention interventions in LMIC schools. A scoping review of the international literature was conducted and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. Medline, PsycInfo, Scopus, Embase, CINAHL and Cochrane were searched for peer-reviewed literature published from 2014 to 2022. PsycExtra, Google Scholar and the websites of key organisations were searched for relevant grey literature. Study selection focussed on mental health promotion interventions, including the development of social and emotional skills and mental health literacy, and prevention interventions, including anti-bullying and skill-based interventions for at-risk students. Twenty-seven studies evaluating 25 school-based interventions in 17 LMICs were included in the review. Fifteen interventions were developed in the implementing country and 10 were adapted from high-income countries (HICs) or other settings. Findings from the studies reviewed were generally positive, especially when interventions were implemented to a high quality. Universal life-skills interventions were found to increase social and emotional skills, decrease problem behaviours and positively impact students mental health and well-being. Mental health literacy interventions increased mental health knowledge and decreased stigma among students and school staff. Outcomes for externally facilitated antibullying interventions were less positive. All 19 effective studies reported on some aspects of programme implementation, and 15 monitored implementation fidelity. Eleven studies outlined the programme s underpinning theoretical model. Only four studies reported on the cultural adaptation of programmes in detail. Including young people in the adaptation process was reported to facilitate natural cultural adaptation of programmes, while input from programme developers was considered key to ensuring that the core components of interventions were retained. The review findings indicate increasing evidence of effective mental health interventions in LMIC schools. To facilitate the sustainability, replication and scaling-up of these interventions, greater attention is needed to reporting on intervention core components, and the processes of implementation and cultural adaptation in the local setting. . © The Author(s), 2024.

AB  - Background: A range of factors including mental disorders, adverse events and history of self-harm are associated with suicide risk. Further examination is needed of the characteristics of suicides which occur without established risk factors, using national surveillance systems. Methods: Data on all suicides in Ireland from 2015 to 2017 were drawn from the Irish Probable Suicide Deaths Study (IPSDS). Variables examined included socio-demographics, psychiatric history and precipitant stressors. Suicide data were linked with data on prior self-harm from the National Self-Harm Registry Ireland (NSHRI). Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was used to identify sub-groups of suicide cases. Results: Of the 1809 individuals who died by suicide, 401 (22.2 %) had a history of hospital-treated self-harm. Four distinct profiles of suicides were identified. One group was marked by high levels of prior self-harm and mental health conditions. Two of the groups included few individuals with a history of self-harm but had notably high levels of mental health conditions. These two groups had relatively high levels of reported chronic pain or illness but differed in terms of socio-demographics. The final group, predominantly male, had markedly low levels of mental health conditions or self-harm but high levels of personal stressors and substance use. Limitations: The use of coronial data may be limited by bias in the collecting of information from the deceased's family members. Conclusions: A sub-group of suicide cases exists without any psychiatric or self-harm history but with salient occupational or health-related proximal stressors. Suicide prevention interventions should include occupational settings and should promote mental health literacy. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Mental illnesses are the leading cause of disease burden among children and young people (CYP) globally. Low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) are disproportionately affected. Enhancing mental health literacy (MHL) is one way to combat low levels of help-seeking and effective treatment receipt. We aimed to synthesis evidence about knowledge, beliefs and attitudes of CYP in LMICs about mental illnesses, their treatments and outcomes, evaluating factors that can enhance or impede help-seeking to inform context-specific and developmentally appropriate understandings of MHL. Eight bibliographic databases were searched from inception to July 2020: PsycInfo, EMBASE, Medline (OVID), Scopus, ASSIA (ProQuest), SSCI, SCI (Web of Science) CINAHL PLUS, Social Sciences full text (EBSCO). 58 papers (41 quantitative, 13 qualitative, 4 mixed methods) representing 52 separate studies comprising 36,429 participants with a mean age of 15.3 [10.4–17.4], were appraised and synthesized using narrative synthesis methods. Low levels of recognition and knowledge about mental health problems and illnesses, pervasive levels of stigma and low confidence in professional healthcare services, even when considered a valid treatment option were dominant themes. CYP cited the value of traditional healers and social networks for seeking help. Several important areas were under-researched including the link between specific stigma types and active help-seeking and research is needed to understand more fully the interplay between knowledge, beliefs and attitudes across varied cultural settings. Greater exploration of social networks and the value of collaboration with traditional healers is consistent with promising, yet understudied, areas of community-based MHL interventions combining education and social contact. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Migrants who relocate to the United States from the Middle East are more likely to face a host of structural and individual barriers that can significantly contribute to their mental health issues and affect their psychological well-being. Addressing mental health problems and incentivizing help-seeking behavior is important among women who are more likely to face daily stressors in childcare, household responsibilities, and marital relationships. In this paper, we discuss factors that impact help-seeking for mental health problems among Middle Eastern migrant women including English language proficiency, structural challenges, and cultural factors such as shame and stigma. We argue that when considering its potential effectiveness, targeting mental health literacy may serve as the best direction for future research and social work intervention in order to enhance help-seeking behavior among this population. Recommendations for social workers include using community-based partnerships to provide educational resources regarding mental health services through healthcare centers, social service agencies, and local Muslim and Arab organizations. © 2024 Authors,.

AB  - Objective This study identified latent subtypes of mental health literacy (MHL) for Internet gaming disorder (IGD) and explored their characteristics and differences in various factors in adolescents. Methods This study analyzed secondary data from the 2019 Youth Smart Digital Media Survey and included data from 1,936 middle and high school students (14–18 years old). Thirteen items of the MHL questionnaire were used for latent profile analysis. We compared the characteristics and predictors of the identified types using various statistical analyses, including one-way ANOVA, chi-square test, and multinomial logistic regression. Results We identified three subtypes of MHL for IGD in adolescents: “low perception-prefer informal resources,” “moderate perception-preferred resources unclear,” and “high perception-prefer professional resources.” Subtypes showed significant differences in sex, age, family affluence, e-learning time during weekdays, mental health risks, level of problematic smartphone use, and IGD. All variables except IGD predicted one or more latent types. Conclusion Practical interventions are required to improve IGD MHL, including customized prevention based on the differences between the three types. © 2024 Korean Neuropsychiatric Association.

AB  - One in five women will experience perinatal anxiety and/or depression. In South Australia, a rural health service identified a high proportion of women with risk of perinatal mental health challenges and sought additional education for midwives. In response, a six-week facilitated, online perinatal mental health education program (e-PMHEP) was piloted. Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the (e-PMHEP) for rural midwives, nurses and Aboriginal maternal infant care practitioners. Method: Program evaluation incorporated a validated online pre/post survey to assess self-reported knowledge, skill and confidence regarding perinatal mental healthcare. Additional questions sought feedback on satisfaction and feasibility. Findings: Sixteen participants from rural South Australia engaged in the project from June to August 2022. Twelve participants completed the online pre/post survey. The overall pre/post knowledge scores were statistically significant (t = 2.73, 8df, p = 0.025) with improvement from the pre to post-test. Pre/post data also showed a measurable increase in confidence and skills. All respondents agreed that the content addressed their learning needs and would recommend this program to other practitioners. Discussion: The e-PMHEP appeared beneficial in developing knowledge, skills and confidence regarding perinatal mental healthcare in rural midwives and practitioners. Only a third of practitioners routinely developed a mental health care plan with women. Key strengths of the program included the accessible content, and the combination of an experienced mental health clinician and a facilitator with lived experience. Conclusion: Providing an accessible, facilitated online perinatal mental health education program could be beneficial for rural midwives. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - This study discusses the significant topic of mental health challenges in Nigeria, focusing on the shortage of mental health professionals, particularly psychiatrists, and the factors influencing medical students' hesitation to pursue psychiatry as a career path. We examine the multifaceted difficulties in Nigeria's mental health environment using various sources, including research studies and statistical data. The scarcity of psychiatrists, with only 250 for a population of 200 million, underscores the urgent need for attention to mental health within the country. Factors such as brain drain, inadequate learning infrastructure, limited research exposure and insufficient health coverage contribute to this crisis. Additionally, societal stigma and financial constraints discourage students from pursuing psychiatry as a career. To address these challenges comprehensively, we propose a holistic approach that involves cross-disciplinary collaboration, robust mental health education in all healthcare programs, community-based awareness initiatives and transdisciplinary teamwork among mental health providers. We highlight the importance of mentorship, scholarships and national advocacy to encourage more individuals to enter the mental health profession, emphasizing the need for diversity and inclusiveness. Furthermore, our paper stresses the significance of research and innovation in advancing mental health treatment and inspiring passion for mental health among students and aspiring professionals. By embracing this comprehensive set of recommendations, we aim to cultivate a diverse, talented and compassionate workforce capable of effectively addressing Nigeria's pressing mental health challenges. © The Author(s), 2024.

AB  - Poor adolescent mental health calls for universal prevention. The Mental Health Foundation’s ‘Peer Education Project’ equips older students (‘peer educators’) to teach younger students (‘peer learners’) about mental health. The peer-led lessons cover defining good and bad mental health, risk and protective factors, self-care, help-seeking and looking after one another. While previous pre-post evaluations have suggested effectiveness, the mechanisms through which the intervention improves mental health literacy remain unclear. We purposively recruited seven secondary schools across England from 2020 to 2022 and collected data through five observations, 12 staff interviews and 15 student focus groups (totalling 134 students; 46 peer educators aged 14–18 years and 88 peer learners aged 11–13 years). Our realist analysis adopted retroductive logic, intertwining deductive and inductive approaches to test the initial programme theory against insights arising from the data. We developed Context–Mechanisms–Outcome configurations related to four themes: (i) modelling behaviours and forming supportive relationships, (ii) relevant and appropriate content, (iii) peer educators feeling empowered and (iV) a school culture that prioritises mental health support. Our refined programme theory highlights key mechanisms, contexts conducive to achieving the outcomes and ways to improve training, recruitment and delivery to maximise effectiveness for similar peer-led initiatives. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Objective: The ability to assess a patient’s risk of harm to self or others is a core competency for mental health clinicians which can have significant patient outcomes. With the growth of simulation in medical education, there is an opportunity to enhance education outcomes for psychiatric risk assessment. The purpose of this study was to determine how simulation is used to build competency in risk assessment and map its educational outcomes. Methods: The authors conducted a systematic scoping review using the Arksey and O’Malley framework. Electronic database searches were conducted by an academic librarian. Studies published before August 2022 which described simulation activities aimed at training clinicians in suicide, self-harm, and/or violence risk assessment were screened for eligibility. Results: Of the 21,814 articles identified, 58 studies were selected for inclusion. The majority described simulations teaching suicide risk assessment, and there was a notable gap for building competency in violence risk assessment. Simulation utility was demonstrated across emergency, inpatient, and outpatient settings involving adult and pediatric care. The most common simulation modality was patient actors. A smaller subset implemented technological approaches, such as automated virtual patient avatars. Outcomes included high learner satisfaction, and increases in psychiatric risk assessment knowledge, competency, and performance. Conclusion: Simulation as an adjuvant to existing medical curricula can be used to teach risk assessment in mental health. Based on the results of our review, the authors provide recommendations for medical educators looking to design and implement simulation in mental health education. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to American Association of Chairs of Departments of Psychiatry, American Association of Directors of Psychiatric Residency Training, Association for Academic Psychiatry and Association of Directors of Medical Student Education in Psychiatry.

AB  - The Erasmus+ project me_HeLi-D (mental health literacy and diversity) aims to promote mental health literacy (MHL) and diversity awareness among adolescents aged 12-15 through a digital program designed to enhance well-being, resilience, and emotional regulation. This paper explores the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) within the me_HeLi-D project, highlighting their potential to support mental health education and intervention. LLMs, such as GPT4, offer scalable, personalized, and contextually relevant support, making them valuable tools in digital mental health initiatives. The paper discusses the benefits and challenges of using LLMs, including their ability to provide immediate, evidence-based responses and the ethical considerations surrounding data privacy and bias. LLMs can deliver tailored feedback and resources that resonate with the diverse experiences of adolescents, thus fostering a more inclusive and supportive environment for mental health learning. Preliminary findings suggest that LLMs can effectively enhance mental health literacy and support adolescents in managing stress and preventing mental health issues. Furthermore, the interactive nature of these models encourages continuous engagement and learning, making complex mental health concepts more accessible to young audiences. The integration of LLMs also highlights their potential to adapt to different cultural contexts, thus promoting diversity awareness more effectively. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research and the responsible development of LLMs in mental health projects, emphasizing the need for ongoing evaluation and adaptation to meet the evolving needs of adolescents. Ultimately, the integration of LLMs within the me_HeLi-D project underscores their potential as powerful allies in the pursuit of better mental health outcomes and greater diversity awareness among youth. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - The purpose of this book is to help graduate students successfully navigate research in applied graduate programs (e.g., psychology, mental health, education). There is no such thing as an easy research or scholarly project like a dissertation or thesis. Students typically need help navigating their way through the nuts and bolts of identifying research interests, developing a project topic, and writing and managing a project, as well as the various relationship and academic skills necessary to successfully (and sanely) complete such a project. Using well-recognized national research competency benchmarks from the field of psychology, students are guided through a comprehensive and proactive approach from the beginning to the end of the research process. Specifically, this book addresses the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary at three stages of graduate school: becoming familiar with research and scholarly work, developing a proposal and managing a project, and finalizing a final project and beyond. Ways to critically evaluate research, conduct research in applied settings, and consider ethics and professional development are reviewed. In addition, ways to foster successful mentoring relationships and work collaboratively are emphasized throughout the book. The accompanying worksheets and tables are designed to help students think through factors to consider at each stage, plan written work and timelines, self-evaluate and improve research and writing skills, and determine steps for moving forward. Recommendations are also made for faculty teaching research courses, running applied research labs, and advising, mentoring, and/or chairing. © Oxford University Press 2024. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Ukrainians staying in Sweden under the EU mass refugee directive may face challenges due to traumas caused by the invasion that started on February 24, 2022. Part of an European Social Fund (ESF) project, our study showed that a brief trauma-focused group intervention onsite helped to increase health and mental-health literacy. The intervention has not yet been adapted online. Methods: This pilot study during six months aimed to investigate the feasibility, acceptability and outcome in perceived trust, anxiety/stress, and perceived health after this brief trauma-focused group intervention online. A second aim was to observe perceived acceptability of the group intervention with different ways of online intervention. Local coaches, interpreters, the authors, and local experts participated. A mixed-methods design with participatory methodology and evaluation were used. Data was collected with a short questionnaire in Ukrainian. Additionally, at the end of each set, we orally asked about perceived trust and integrity. There were six sets of five group sessions per set, a total of 30 sessions. Each group met online five times for 2 h, a total of 10 h excluding pre- and post-assessment. Breathing exercises sought to reduce stress among the participants. Results: The group intervention had both strengths and limitations. Baseline data were obtained from 136 participants, mostly females (75.7%). Answers to pre- and post-questionnaires showed that perceived anxiety/stress was significantly reduced (N = 91, chi-2 20.648, df = 6, p <.02). Perceived health significantly improved between pre- (mean 63.6) and post (77.2) (N = 77, t = −8.08, df = 66, p <.001). Older participants were vulnerable with higher stress and lower mean perceived health after the intervention. Four out of ten needed individual psychosocial support online.The participants' open questions were analyzed with qualitative content analysis, giving five general categories and 25 sub-categories and the theme “Strong efforts to cope with Swedish system”. Conclusion: Trust and reduced anxiety level changed after the intervention and a combination online of small, closed group meetings with the possibility of personal acquaintance, trust and individual follow-up psychosocial support for those in need to be paid attention to for future refugee support services, particular an online format. 2025 Ekblad, Gramatik and Suprun.

AB  - A transdiagnostic approach is increasingly recognized as crucial in the prevention or treatment of child internalizing and externalizing mental health concerns. There is substantial overlap and comorbidity among various mental health concerns and the onset of one mental illness elevates the risk of others, underscoring the potential limitations of singular-focused mental health education or treatment. Meaning Mindset Theory (MMT) is a transdiagnostic framework developed and evaluated over the past decade in Canada as a promising new approach. MMT emphasizes agency over thoughts and behaviors, empathy and social competence skills, and meaningful engagement to enhance resilience for both internalizing and externalizing symptoms. The DREAM Program—Developing Resilience through Emotions, Attitudes, and Meaning is a mental health education program grounded in MMT principles. This program has enhanced meaning mindset—agency over thoughts and behaviors, hope for a future that is good, positive self-concept, and openness to learning, new experiences, and feelings—as well as both internalizing and externalizing mental health. To date, the DREAM program, as well as MMT more broadly, has been tested in diverse populations with school-aged children, families, neurodiverse and intellectually gifted young people, homeless men, and Black families, among others. Future research should explore the efficacy of an MMT in therapeutic settings compared to standard treatments, potentially enhancing mental health intervention strategies for Canadian children and families. © © 2025 Armstrong, Watt, Potter and Epperson.

AB  - Addressing adolescent mental health care across sub-Saharan Africa faces numerous challenges, including underfunded public health systems, a shortage of mental health professionals, barriers to access, and pervasive stigma. Untreated adolescents often experience worsening symptoms, academic and social difficulties, physical health risks, and engage in risky behaviours. Early detection and appropriate treatment of common mental health conditions can support adolescents in developing robust social and emotional foundations and enhancing their mental well-being. Ensuring adolescents receive the mental health care required for healthy development depends on collaborative, evidence-based solutions that consider the contextual challenges of sub-Saharan Africa. Innovative community-based solutions to mental health services may significantly improve accessibility and support adolescents close to their homes and schools. For example, co-creation and peer-delivered interventions with professional supervision may enhance uptake and reduce stigma. This short article adds to the current debate arguing for working with communities and implementing community mental health services for common mental health conditions. Sensitivity to community-specific challenges and building referral networks are crucial for effective care. Investing in these strategies, alongside increasing mental health literacy, could lead to affordable and significant interventions to address adolescent mental health. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Adolescence is a critical period for developing and maintaining good habits for mental health and well-being. This is crucial for future mental health; as most mental health problems emerge during adolescence. Mental health literacy forms the foundation for preventing mental health issues, reducing stigma, and enhancing the effectiveness of help-seeking, particularly among adolescents. Objective: This study aims to measure the effect of social media-based educational intervention on mental health literacy among male high school students in Ramhormoz city. Methods: This randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluated the effectiveness of a social media-based intervention, designed around the core components of The Guide training package. The study involves all high schools in Ramhormoz city using a stratified random sampling method. A total of 204 students are expected to participate. Measures of mental health literacy and attitudes towards seeking professional psychological help are evaluated at three time points: before the intervention (baseline), 3 months, and 6 months after the intervention. Results: We anticipate a significant improvement in the mental health literacy score of the intervention group compared to the control group at post-intervention and both follow-ups. Additionally, we expect a substantial enhancement in the attitude towards seeking professional psychological help score for the intervention group compared to the control group at post-intervention and 6-month follow-up, though not at the 3-month follow-up. Conclusion: In conclusion, this study will contribute valuable insights into the effectiveness of social media-based interventions in enhancing mental health literacy and attitudes towards seeking professional help among high school students. The results will guide future initiatives in mental health education and promotion. Clinical trials: This study protocol is registered with the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT) under the registration number IRCT20230603058372N1, dated June 5, 2023.

AB  - Introduction: COVID-19 has increased parental stress and significantly impacted the psychological well-being of individuals, especially parents of school-age children. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy posits that individuals can accept their unchangeable inner experiences (thoughts and feelings) while acting in ways aligned with their personal values, demonstrating effectiveness in reducing stress and improving psychological well-being, especially among parents of children with chronic illness. This study aimed to test the effectiveness of a group-based ACT, delivered flexibly, in improving stress and psychological well-being in parents with school-age children, regardless of their children’s chronic conditions, within a real-world context. Methods: This quasi-experimental study recruited parents with school-age children, through convenience sampling from the Christian Family Service Centre in Hong Kong. The group-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy intervention consisted of five weekly sessions delivered via face-to-face meetings and online videoconferencing, consistent with participants’ preferences and COVID-19 related restrictions in Hong Kong. Paired t-tests and Generalized Estimating Equations following the intention-to-treat principle were used to examine the overall effects and the moderating effects of delivery methods. Results: The study included 250 parents, with an average age of 40.90 years, mostly women. The average age of their youngest child was 7.68 years. In line with COVID-19-related restrictions and participants’ preferences, 109 parents participated in online sessions, while 141 attended face-to-face sessions. Results showed significant small-to-medium improvements in various outcome variables after the intervention, including parental stress (Cohen’s d = 0.26), general stress (d = 0.18), depressive symptoms (d = 0.18), mental health literacy (d = 0.43), subjective wellbeing (d = 0.25), and psychological flexibility (d = 0.28). Notably, the online videoconferencing format was found to be as effective as the face-to-face format, with similar session attendance rates. Conclusion: The findings highlight the potential of group-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy to alleviate stress and improve psychological well-being in parents of school-age children, regardless of the delivery method, especially during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. However, due to limitations in the study design, caution is warranted when interpreting the overall effects of group-based ACT on parent outcomes and the moderating role of delivery methods. Further research is needed to validate these findings and explore the nuances of delivery methods in similar real-world situations. © © 2024 Mak, Leung, Zhang, Chung, Chow, Ruan and Yeung.

AB  - Purpose: Adolescence is a stage where genetic and environmental vulnerabilities can emerge as behavioural and emotional disorders. Early detection and seeking professional help are critical for these groups. This study aims to explore how mental health literacy (MHL) and other demographic variables impact help-seeking behaviour among adolescents in India. Design/methodology/approach: This quantitative study used a structured questionnaire comprising demographic variables and standardized measurement tools to assess MHL, and help-seeking behaviour among adolescent pupils. Two hundred students aged 14 and above were randomly selected, with informed consent of themselves and their parents, from selected public and private schools in Ernakulam district, Kerala, India. Findings: The mean age of the sample was 14.5 and 67% belonged to nuclear families with the majority being male (64%). The help-seeking attitude was negatively associated with the ability to recognize disorders among male students and positively associated with attitudes that promote recognition or appropriate help-seeking behaviour among female students. Additionally, hailing from extended families was associated with help-seeking behaviour among adolescent boys, but this relationship was not significant for girls. Originality/value: The current study has identified that targeted interventions for male adolescents should focus on enhancing disorder recognition and leveraging family support, while those for female adolescents, the programs should promote positive attitudes towards recognizing mental health issues and help-seeking behaviours, integrating families and schools in the process. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This study examines the integration of biofeedback mechanisms with mental health education as a biotechnological intervention to improve psychological states and neural activity in patients with psychopathology. Using a sample of 105 clinically diagnosed psychologically depressed student patients at H City People’s Hospital from January 2022 to January 2023, the therapeutic effects of biofeedback were evaluated. Patients were randomly divided into two groups: 36 patients in the control group received traditional mental health education, while 36 patients in the experimental group received EEG biofeedback therapy in addition to mental health education. Key indicators, including brain wave activity and heart rate variability (HRV), as well as the coupling coordination index, were measured and compared between the two groups. Results showed that the experimental group exhibited significant improvements in neural activity and psychological resilience compared to the control group. Specifically, the lgLF of the experimental group after treatment was 2.03 ± 0.52, compared to 2.45 ± 0.32 in the control group, reflecting a notable enhancement in autonomic nervous system regulation. Furthermore, the coupling coordination index of the experimental group increased from 0.5073 to 0.8423, representing a 1.62-fold improvement. These findings demonstrate the synergistic potential of combining biofeedback mechanisms with mental health education in enhancing psychological well-being and neural function. This research highlights the value of biofeedback as a biotechnological tool for advancing mental health interventions, with significant implications for public health. By fostering positive psychological development and improving neural regulation, this approach offers a scalable and innovative solution for addressing mental health challenges. Future applications may explore the broader commercialization and integration of biofeedback technologies in educational and healthcare settings to promote sustainable mental health outcomes. © 2024, Journal of Commercial Biotechnology.

AB  - The lack of knowledge of cadres about mental health causes a lack of social support for pregnant women. This study aims to analyze the effectiveness of mental health education for maternal and child health cadres on the knowledge and social support of cadres. This study was conducted with a quasi-experimental pre-test and post-test design with a control group. Sampling was carried out by cluster random sampling in the city of Surakarta. The intervention group consisted of 45 cadres in the Gajahan health center area and the control group consisted of 47 cadres in the Pajang health center area. While educational interventions use short story video media equipped with infographics. Data on knowledge and social support were collected using a questionnaire that had been tested for validity. Data analysis used independent t-tests and paired t-tests because the data were normally distributed. To analyze the data, this research used free statistical software. The results of this study are there were differences in the scores of mental health knowledge and social support between the intervention group and the control group (p-value <0.001). The intervention effectiveness test was carried out on the difference between the two groups’ pretest and post-test data. This study concluded that mental health education with video media for maternal and child health cadres is effective in increasing mental health knowledge and cadre social support for pregnant women. © 2024, Universitas Negeri Semarang.

AB  - Background: Vietnam’s mental health care system is undergoing significant changes since the government has initiated large-scale programs to reform and develop the mental health care infrastructure. Cultural belief systems on mental illnesses influence help-seeking behavior and compliance. This study investigates the belief systems about people with schizophrenia and depression among people living in the Hanoi area. Method: 1077 Vietnamese participants answered two open-ended questions after reading an unlabeled vignette describing a character with the symptoms of schizophrenia or depression. The answers were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Of all participants, 88,4% associated the presented cases with a mental illness, with 91,5% in the case of schizophrenia and 85,1% in the case of depression, so both disorders were conceptualized as mental illnesses. 18,6% mentioned depression when presented with the depression vignette, while only 3,6% recognized schizophrenia in the schizophrenia condition. Conclusions: Almost 9 out of 10 participants considered the presented cases as an example of mental illness, suggesting a high mental health awareness among our participants. The majority did not identify the presented cases as examples of schizophrenia or depression, reflecting little familiarity with Western mental health concepts. It could be interpreted as a sign of relatively low mental health literacy among the study participants. © © 2024 Mobashery, Ta, Cao, Böge, Eilinghoff, Nguyen, Mavituna, Fuchs, Weyn-Banningh, Kemna, Bajbouj and Hahn.

AB  - Background: Mental health literacy (MHL) is a crucial concept in mental health because it promotes positive mental health outcomes and behaviors across various demographics, including adolescents. Aims: This study utilized the MHLS-Arabic-Adolescents tool to investigate MHL among Palestinian adolescents in Israel, aiming to explore its significance in determining intentions to seek formal and informal mental health help separately. Methods: A cohort of 172 adolescents (with a mean age of 16.25 ± 1.25 years, comprising 64% females) completed assessments measuring their intention for both formal and informal help-seeking, levels of psychological distress, MHL, and various sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. This study uses the same dataset from previous research on formal help-seeking, with an expanded focus on informal help-seeking and MHL using an adapted tool. Results: Participants reported medium to high levels of MHL factors, demonstrating stronger intentions to seek informal help compared to formal. “Knowledge of where to seek information” and “Attitude toward mental illness” emerged as the significant MHL factors determining formal help-seeking intentions, whereas ‘attitudes toward mental illness’ was identified as the sole determinant of intentions to seek informal help. Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of MHL factors in shaping adolescents’ intentions to seek formal and informal mental health help. It emphasizes the need to strengthen informal support networks, improve adolescents’ attitudes toward mental illness, and facilitate access to mental health information. These insights offer valuable guidance for intervention programs aimed at promoting both formal and informal help-seeking behaviors among Palestinian Arab adolescents in Israel and similar groups. © © 2024 Abo-Rass.

AB  - This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of incorporating mental health education into ideological and political theory classrooms using speech emotion recognition technology from the field of human-computer interaction. Mental health education is essential for students' well-being, and this study establishes a theoretical framework for its integration into the curriculum. Utilizing recurrent neural networks (RNNs) augmented with attention mechanisms, the research demonstrates the model's proficiency in identifying subtle emotional cues within speech data. The model achieves an average recognition accuracy of 87.21% on the RAVDESS speech emotion corpus, showing particular strengths in detecting emotions like happiness and boredom. The findings suggest that this technology can be effectively employed to gauge student satisfaction with different teaching methodologies post-integration, offering valuable insights for refining educational practices in ideological and political theory classes through improved mental health education initiatives. © 2024 IGI Global.

AB  - Millions of adolescents participate in sport programs annually across the globe. In this article, we will discuss key issues related to adolescent sport participation. First, demographic information, including inequalities related to sport participation, are discussed along with details on the organization of youth sport. Then, we present how adolescents in appropriate sport environments can experience a range of positive outcomes such as improved physical health, mental health, and mental health literacy. However, inappropriate environments can contribute to poor outcomes including poor physical health outcomes, mental health challenges, and dropout from sport. We conclude by suggesting ways in which parents, coaches, administrators, and peers can all play a role in helping to create appropriate sport environments for adolescents. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This review synthesises current research on the prevalence and determinants of depressive and anxiety symptoms among medical students. It highlights significant mental health challenges faced by this group, emphasising the influence of various factors such as academic pressures, personality traits, and reluctance to seek professional help. The analysis also delves into the roles of gender and geographical variation, revealing how these factors contribute to differing rates of mental health issues among medical students globally. The findings reveal a concerning prevalence of depression and anxiety, with variation observed across different regions and genders, indicating the influence of cultural and societal norms on mental health. This review underscores the urgent need for enhanced mental health support and intervention strategies within medical education systems. The importance of incorporating psychological support programmes and mental health education into curricula is highlighted. By addressing these issues, there is a potential to significantly improve the well-being and academic success of medical students, ultimately contributing to their overall mental health and resilience in their future professional lives. The paper advocates for a multifaceted approach in tackling these challenges, suggesting that medical institutions should not only focus on academic excellence but also prioritise the mental health of their students, ensuring a more supportive and nurturing educational environment. © 2024 Medical Communications.

AB  - Student learning and development of emotional control abilities are aided by mental health education. It makes it possible for students to understand the sensations and emotions better. Students' mental health and negative emotional responses can help to quickly resolve psychological issues and prevent them from interfering with their regular academic programs. In this study, we proposed a novel Northern Goshwak deep multi-structured Convolutional neural network (NG-DMCNN) to recognize studentsemotions related to mental health education. For this study, 300 participant’sfacial and physiological data were acquired. Pre-processed data using Kalman filtering is an advanced method for data noise reduction. The NG-DMCNN method is compared to the other traditional algorithms. Significant performance metrics were attained by the NG-DMCNN model: recall of 78.42%, accuracy of 94.56%, precision of 92.38%, and F1-score of 89.67%. The result shows the psychological stress test indicates that the students are in good health and not performing well. The proposed method hassuperior performance than other algorithms. The study intends to offer a more accurate and effective method for health education. © 2024 Slovene Society Informatika. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study explores the efficacy of AI-generated music compared to traditional pop music in alleviating anxiety among high school students from a Chinese international school and an American high school. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, the research integrates quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews to assess the impacts of music interventions before and after exposure. Initial findings indicated that both groups experienced significant reductions in anxiety, as measured by the GAD-7 scale, with AI-generated music showing a greater decrease. The quantitative results revealed that after a four-week intervention, students listening to AI music exhibited a marked improvement in anxiety levels with the Chinese international school students' scores dropping from an average of 13.33 to 6.06, and the American students' scores from 14.02 to 7.28. In contrast, those who listened to pop music also showed improvements but to a lesser extent. Qualitative interviews further highlighted the personalized experience of AI music, enhancing its effectiveness in reducing stress compared to the broader appeal of pop music which was linked more to cultural resonance and social connectivity. The interaction effects analyzed through mixed linear models and F-tests showed statistically significant differences in the impact of music types across cultures. This study underscores the potential of personalized AI-driven music interventions in mental health strategies tailored for diverse cultural contexts, suggesting a paradigm shift towards more customized therapeutic approaches in global mental health education. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Despite elevated rates of trauma exposure, substance misuse, mental health problems, and suicide, systems-impacted teens and their caregivers have limited access to empirically supported behavioral health services. Family-based interventions are the most effective for improving mental health, education, substance use, and delinquency outcomes, yet the familial and placement disruption that occurs during child welfare involvement can interfere with the delivery of family-based interventions. Objective: To address this gap in access to services, we adapted an in-person, empirically supported, family-based affect management intervention using a trauma-informed lens to be delivered via telehealth to families impacted by the child welfare system (Family Telehealth Project). We describe the intervention adaptation process and an open trial to evaluate its feasibility, acceptability, and impact. Methods: Adaptations to the in-person, family-based affect management intervention were conducted iteratively with input from youth, caregivers, and systems partners. Through focus groups and collaborative meetings with systems partners, a caregiver-only version of the intervention was also developed. An open trial of the intervention was conducted to assess family perspectives of its acceptability and feasibility and inform further refinements prior to a larger-scale evaluation. Participants included English-speaking families involved in the child welfare system in the past 12 months with teens (aged 12-18 years). Caregivers were eligible to participate either individually (caregivers of origin, kinship caregivers, or foster parents; n=7) or with their teen (caregiver of origin only; n=6 dyads). Participants completed session feedback forms and surveys at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 3-month posttreatment time points. Qualitative exit interviews were conducted with a subset of participants (12/19, 63%) to further understand their experiences with the intervention. Results: Session attendance was high, and both caregivers and teens reported high acceptability of clinicians and sessions on feedback forms. Families were comfortable with video technology, with very few (<5%) sessions having reported technology problems. Thematic analysis of exit interview transcripts indicated that families used effective communication and affect management skills taught during the intervention. Regarding challenges and barriers, some caregiver-only participants expressed a desire to have their teen also participate in the intervention. All interview participants reported that they would recommend the intervention to others and perceptions of the intervention were overwhelmingly positive. Quantitative surveys revealed differential responses to the intervention regarding affect management and communication. Conclusions: An open trial of the Family Telehealth Project, a skills-based telehealth intervention for families impacted by the child welfare system, suggests high levels of intervention feasibility and acceptability. Participants noted improvements in areas often hindered by the impacts of trauma and family separation: communication and affect management. Perceptions of the intervention were positive overall for both teens and caregivers. The Family Telehealth Project shows promise in addressing the gaps in behavioral health access for systems-impacted families. © 2024 JMIR Publications Inc.. All rights reserved.

AB  - Adolescent health literacy is critical for navigating the complex landscape of modern healthcare and making informed decisions that influence long-term health outcomes. This comprehensive review synthesizes current research on integrating digital tools and interactive learning approaches to enhance health literacy among adolescents. We explore the use of digital technologies, such as mobile apps and virtual reality, which cater to the preferences of this tech-savvy generation, offering personalized and accessible health information. The effectiveness of interactive learning methodologies, including simulations and role-playing, is also examined, highlighting their potential to increase engagement and retention of health-related knowledge. We address the importance of mental health literacy and the role of social media and peer education in disseminating health information effectively. Our review identifies gaps in the current literature, particularly the need for studies that consider long-term outcomes and the impact of socioeconomic and cultural factors on health literacy initiatives. We propose a multidimensional approach to health literacy education that incorporates innovative technologies and interactive methods to meet the diverse needs of adolescents in various contexts. The findings suggest that an integrated approach, including digital and critical health literacy, is essential for developing comprehensive health education programs that are both informative and engaging for adolescents. © © 2024 Mancone, Corrado, Tosti, Spica and Diotaiuti.

AB  - Introduction: Health literacy is defined as the "ability to obtain, process and understand basic health information and to access health services in order to make informed choices”. The concept of Mental Health Literacy (MHL) has been introduced in recent years in order to promote mental health. MHL refers to knowledge and beliefs about mental disorders that facilitate their recognition, management, and prevention. A low level of MHL represents a fundamental barrier to seeking mental health care. Methods: For this review we followed a narrative approach. Papers published between 2013 and 2024 were screened for inclusion. Only 24 articles met the inclusion criteria, all of them were included in the review. Results: Among the 24 articles included, schools represented a particularly important context for interventions, as adolescents spend much of their time in school and school staff are often the point of reference for young people seeking help and advice. School-based interventions aimed at improving MHL and reducing stigma have the potential to prevent mental disorders and promote mental well-being, ultimately reducing their health, social, and economic burden. Conclusions: Schools are a key setting for mental health interventions, given the significant time adolescents spend there and their reliance on school staff for support. Enhancing MHL and reducing stigma through school-based programs can prevent mental disorders and promote well-being. Both live and digital interventions have shown effectiveness, though long-term impacts need more study. © 2024 Medicinska Naklada Zagreb. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction and Objectives: Canadians rely on their primary care providers to address their mental health needs, but there are longstanding system gaps that must be addressed to enhance their ability to deliver mental health care. The present study addressed the gap in pediatric mental health care through the development, delivery, and evaluation of a mental health literacy training among non-physician primary care providers. Methods: We delivered the training among 97 participants, with all completed the pre-test survey, and 74 completed the post-test survey on knowledge, attitudes toward mental health, and help-seeking intentions. Additionally, participants explained why they attended the training and shared how they would apply the knowledge learned into their practice (behaviors). Results: Participants improved their knowledge significantly from pre-test to post-test, P <.001, d = 2.51. We didn’t find any statistical significance between pre-test and post-test on attitudes, P =.067, nor on help-seeking intentions, P =.274. However, participants’ scores were exceedingly high on both outcomes, indicating positive attitudes and intentions at 2 time points and implying a ceiling effect of both outcomes. We did not find outcome differences by demographics, practice year, practice zone, or professional role. While knowledge, years of practice and prior mental health training predicted participants attitudes at pre-test, they didn’t at post-test. Attitudes toward mental health predicted help-seeking intentions. Participants indicated this training will change their practice behaviors. Conclusion: This mental health literacy training for primary care providers demonstrated strong evidence of the need to integrate mental health and addiction support into primary care practice. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Introduction: In recent years, the suicide rate among adolescents in China has shown a continuous upward trend, and mental health issues such as depression and excessive anxiety have become increasingly prominent. Awareness and concerns around poor mental health in adolescents is rising among the general public and in academic circles, but there is little research on adolescent mental health policies in China. Methods: This article reviews the national policies on adolescent mental health from 2000 to 2023, and analyzes and evaluates the selected policy texts through the PMC index model. Results: The study indicates growing national attention towards adolescent mental health policies in terms of both quantity and quality, with improved policy feasibility and synergy. However, shortcomings exist in the policy formulation process, including a lack of advocacy and supervision-oriented policies, a focus on short to medium-term effects, and inadequate comprehensive planning, hindering their swift implementation. Discussion: In conclusion, facing the escalating crisis of adolescent mental health, the previous requirements of the education system are no longer sufficient. The government needs to further improve the top-down policy system, weave a safety net for mental health education and preventive intervention, and effectively promote the development of adolescent mental health. © © 2024 Yang.

AB  - Introduction and objective: Mental Health Literacy (MHL) is important in promoting youth mental health. One key aspect of MHL is knowledge about mental disorders, which is particularly relevant for populations at risk for developing mental disorders, such as children of parents with a mental illness (COPMI), representing a mechanism within the transgenerational transmission. Currently, COPMI’s level of disorder knowledge in general, and about the specific parental disorder has not been comprehensively researched. We, therefore, aimed to assess COPMI’s disorder knowledge and clarify its association with COPMI’s age and sex exploratively. To assess both general and disorder-specific knowledge, we took a novel approach that makes disorder knowledge comparable across samples and over time. Methods: A mixed method analysis of N = 181 semi-structured MHL interviews with COPMI (aged 5 to 17 years) was carried out in the COMPARE—family study in Germany. We conducted a DSM-oriented deductive qualitative content analysis to assess COPMI’s general and specific disorder knowledge. Chi-square tests served to identify age and sex differences. Results: Children revealed limited knowledge of mental disorders in general, whereas adolescents displayed more knowledge that was also partly consistent with descriptions of classification systems like the DSM-5. The level of specific knowledge about the parent’s disorder depended on the disorder group. More children displayed adequate knowledge of somatic and anxiety disorders compared to trauma and depressive disorders, and more adolescents displayed adequate knowledge of depressive and anxiety disorders. COPMI’s age and sex were found to be significantly associated with disorder knowledge: adolescents exhibited higher levels of adequate general and specific disorder knowledge, and males exhibited higher levels of adequate general disorder knowledge. Conclusion: Assessing COPMI’s disorder knowledge and identifying associated age and sex differences yield valuable insights into the knowledge component of the MHL theory. Our findings can help to improve psychoeducational interventions for COPMI by orienting them to their prevailing levels of disorder knowledge. We recommend employing and extending the DSM-oriented deductive approach to assess knowledge within MHL. Analyses involving additional assessments within the COMPARE—family study are in preparation to identify potential knowledge gains over time, and associations to COPMI’s own well-being and mental health symptoms. © © 2024 Kinzenbach, Praum, Stracke, Schwenck, Kieser, Otto, Reck, Steinmayr, Wirthwein, Zietlow, Christiansen and the COMPARE-family Research Group.

AB  - Online mental health services offer programs and resources for users to better manage their mental health, where part of the process of engaging in these services involves initiatives that attempt to motivate a transition from online to face-to-face support. What can we make of those initiatives through the insight of users? This research, platforming the voices of young adults aged 18–25 years, provides valuable insights into the unique help-seeking experiences of this demographic and the effectiveness of online mental health services in facilitating a transition to face-to-face support. Using an online survey comprising of open-response and Likert scale questions, 101 participants provided qualitative and quantitative feedback. Key quantitative findings revealed 66% of participants had transitioned from online mental health services to face-to-face supports following their initial engagement. Moreover, a substantial 57.05% of participants expressed satisfaction with their online experiences. Mental health education pages were the most accessed resource by service users, with 82.18% of participants having used them. Emerging from a series of 10-point Likert scale questions, “contact with a professional” (7.58) and “receiving a referral” (9.25) were the highest rated predictors of transition, while barriers such as a “lack of motivation” and “bureaucratic complexities” were identified from qualitative data as the dominant inhibiting factors. Lastly, psychoeducation emerged as a crucial tool for empowering participants toward overcoming stigma, with the theme of trust highlighted as the most critical factor in determining the confidence of young adults attempting to transition from online to face-to-face support. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: There is growing evidence that climate change can negatively impact people’s mental health. Therefore, it is important for psychologists to receive adequate training in this area. However, little is known about current levels of training, including the amount of climate change mental health education within postgraduate psychology programs in Australia and Aotearoa-New Zealand. Method: Two cross-sectional surveys regarding climate change and mental health were emailed to postgraduate psychology programs in Australia and Aotearoa-New Zealand. The first invited participation from program coordinators (n = 17), the second students (n = 159). We conducted quantitative content analysis and thematic analysis of qualitative responses. Results: Most participants believe this is an important topic of training for psychologists as climate change will impact the mental health of their clients. Further, results indicate minimal climate change mental health content in postgraduate psychology training programs in Australia and Aotearoa-New Zealand. Conclusions: Integration of climate change mental health education into postgraduate psychology curriculum will work towards equipping the emerging mental health workforce to address this growing demand, which in turn can improve mental health outcomes in a changing climate. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - This paper attempts to test and analyze students' mental health status through the reform of physical education curriculum setting mode, reveal the changes and characteristics of individual mental health status, and then promote reasonable and effective physical education reform and the integration of psychological education. Furthermore, this article investigates people's mental health using the Apriori algorithm and the BP algorithm, and accurately presents the current condition using data graphs and other approaches, and its accuracy has grown by 20.32%. It also concludes that we should pursue the aims of social adaption and mental health, as well as support improved implementation of the new physical education curriculum. Physical education instruction must be engaging, but it cannot be done in isolation from sports and practice. As part of the new curriculum reform, physical education should be linked with psychological education. © 2024 IGI Global. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: With a global prevalence of mental disorders among adolescents, exacerbated by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)’s impact, understanding the dynamics of seeking assistance is crucial. Therefore, this study determined the status of the help-seeking intention and the factors affecting it among high school students in Saveh (center of Iran). Methods: In this cross-sectional study conducted in 2023, 400 students from different high schools were selected by a multi-stage stratified random sampling procedure. They were studied using the Short Form of Mental Health Continuum Questionnaire (MHC-SF), Attitude Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help Questionnaire (ATSPPH), Help-seeking Intention Questionnaire (GHSQ), and perceived barriers related to mental health services. Data were analyzed via SPSS 21 software using linear regression and descriptive statistical methods. Furthermore, P< 0.05 was considered statistically significant Results: The mean score attitude toward mental health services, perceived barriers to mental health services, and positive mental health were 33.8 ± 5.5, 23.5 ± 3.8, and 42.36 ± 10.39, respectively. Close friends were favored for informal help-seeking (4.3 ± 0.97), while doctors preferred formal help-seeking (3.4 ± 0.91). Furthermore, attitude toward mental health services was the most important predictor of formal help-seeking (P value < 0.001; β = 3.89), while positive mental health was the most important predictor of informal help-seeking (P value < 0.001; β = 2.93). Conclusion: The findings of this study identified friends, family, and doctors as primary sources of informal and formal help-seeking among adolescents. Mental health literacy education is crucial for these groups. Given boys’ lower help-seeking intentions and the influence of attitudes and perceived barriers, comprehensive training is recommended. Hence, it is essential to incorporate mental health literacy programs within school curricula. Moreover, school counselors should receive comprehensive training to identify and address mental health issues effectively among students. © 2024 The Author(s);

AB  - Background: Mental health literacy (MHL) research in Jordan is sparse and validated MHL measures are lacking. The present study validated a Jordanian version of the Mental Health Literacy Scale (MHLS) and examined Jordanian individuals’ MHL. Method: A Google Forms survey was designed, and the link was shared through various Jordanian social media platforms. Factor analysis and Rasch analysis were performed to validate the Jordanian version of the MHLS. Binary logistic regression was performed to assess variables associated with MHL. Results: The Jordanian MHLS was administered to 974 participants (74.4% females; median age 27 years). The mean MHL score of the participants was 71.1% indicating average literacy levels. The factor analysis indicated that 27 items distributed across four factors had the best model fit. The Rasch analysis confirmed item separation reliability and person reliability. The regression showed a correlation between educational attainment, income, marital status and MHL level. These findings emphasize the role of educational attainment in MHL, pointing to the necessity of integrating mental health education into formal curricula to enhance MHL across all societal levels. Stigma and limited-service availability act as barriers to mental health service and access, which compound the challenge of improving MHL. Targeted educational interventions and policy reforms may help improve MHL, thereby contributing to improving mental health outcomes in Jordan and potentially other similar settings. © © 2024 Al-Qerem, Jarab, Khdour, Eberhardt, Alasmari, Hammad, Zumot and Khalil.

Results: 33 studies were included and categorized into four themes reflecting their respective clinical/research/preventive paradigm: (i) BPD as a comorbidity in CHR-P youth (k = 20), emphasizing early detection and intervention in psychosis; (ii) attenuated psychosis syndrome (APS) as a comorbidity among BPD inpatients (k = 2), with a focus on hospitalized adolescents/young adults admitted for non-psychotic mental disorders; (iii) mixed samples (k = 7), including descriptions of early intervention services and referral pathways; (iv) transdiagnostic approaches (k = 4) highlighting “clinical high at risk mental state” (CHARMS) criteria to identify a pluripotent risk state for severe mental disorders. Conclusion: The scoping review reveals diverse approaches to clinical care for CHR-P and BPD, with no unified treatment strategies. Recommendations for future research should focus on: (i) exploring referral pathways across early intervention clinics to promote timely intervention; (ii) enhancing early detection strategies in innovative settings such as emergency departments; (iii) improving mental health literacy to facilitate help-seeking behaviors; (iv) analysing comorbid disorders as complex systems to better understand and target early psychopathology; (v) investigating prospective risk for BPD; (vi) developing transdiagnostic interventions; (vii) engaging youth with lived experience of comorbidity to gain insight on their subjective experience; (viii) understanding caregiver burden to craft family-focused interventions; (ix) expanding research in underrepresented regions such as Africa and Asia, and; (x) evaluating the cost-effectiveness of early interventions to determine scalability across different countries.

AB  - This questionnaire-based study aimed to explore depression literacy (DL) and help-giving experiences in 12–18-year-old adolescents (N = 535, M<inf>age</inf> = 14.9 years, 51.8% male) in Ireland. In response to a vignette depicting a character displaying symptoms of depression, 46.7% labelled these symptoms ‘depression’, with increasing age and empathy associated with increased likelihood of labelling as such. Almost all (92.1%) believed the character needed help, but the perceived helpfulness of potential responses varied. Over one-third (38.2%) indicated they knew someone who had displayed similar symptoms in the past year, with 85.2% of these reporting having helped this person. Reported help-giving responses included comforting the person, encouraging professional help-seeking, and informing an adult. The findings suggest adolescent DL can be best supported by developmentally-sensitive interventions that encourage empathy and the importance of engaging adults’ assistance. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Background: Self-harm is common among adolescents and is a major public health concern. School staff may be the first adults to notice a young person’s self-harm and are well placed to provide support or signpost students to help. However, school staff often report that they do not feel equipped or confident to support students. Despite the need, there is a lack of evidence-based training about self-harm for school staff. A web-based training program would provide schools with a flexible and cost-effective method of increasing staff knowledge, skills, and confidence in how to respond to students who self-harm. Objective: The main objective of this study was to coproduce an evidence-based training program for school staff to improve their skills and confidence in responding to students who self-harm (Supportive Response to Self-Harm [SORTS]). This paper describes the design and development process of an initial prototype coproduced with stakeholders to ensure that the intervention meets their requirements. Methods: Using a user-centered design and person-based approach, the SORTS prototype was informed by (1) a review of research literature, existing guidelines, and policies; (2) coproduction discussions with the technical provider and subject matter experts (mental health, education, and self-harm); (3) findings from focus groups with young people; and (4) coproduction workshops with school staff. Thematic analysis using the framework method was applied. Results: Coproduction sessions with experts and the technical provider enabled us to produce a draft of the training content, a wireframe, and example high-fidelity user interface designs. Analysis of focus groups and workshops generated four key themes: (1) need for a training program; (2) acceptability, practicality, and implementation; (3) design, content, and navigation; and (4) adaptations and improvements. The findings showed that there is a clear need for a web-based training program about self-harm in schools, and the proposed program content and design were useful, practical, and acceptable. Consultations with stakeholders informed the iterative development of the prototype. Conclusions: SORTS is a web-based training program for school staff to appropriately respond to students who self-harm that is based on research evidence and developed in collaboration with stakeholders. The SORTS program will equip school staff with the skills and strategies to respond in a supportive way to students who self-harm and encourage schools to adopt a whole-school approach to self-harm. Further research is needed to complete the intervention development based on the feedback from this study and evaluate the program’s effectiveness. If found to be effective, the SORTS program could be implemented in schools and other youth organizations. ©Anne-Marie Burn, Poppy Hall, Joanna Anderson.

AB  - Background: A good understanding of health-related information is crucial for people to make informed decisions about their well-being. Mental health disorders like depression and anxiety can have a significant impact on one's quality of life. Unfortunately, not everyone has equal access to resources and health education, hindering their health literacy. Adolescents in remote areas with mental health issues have more difficulties in addressing their disorder due to the limited resources available, which can have long-term consequences. Peer support interventions have successfully promoted behavioral changes and addressed mental health problems. Digital and online game-based learning has widely been used in mental health education. Board games have several advantages over digital game-based learning in improving the effectiveness of game-based learning in mental health education among adolescents in remote areas. Objective: This study examined the effectiveness of game-based learning using a board game called “Carpe Diem” in adolescent mental health intervention. Our focus was to assess the effect of board games on awareness, peer involvement, and stigma about adolescent mental health. Methods: We used a mixed-methods approach with an embedded experimental model involving 45 senior high-school students chosen using cluster random sampling to represent the variety of school characteristics in Kupang City, Indonesia, in January 2020. Quantitative data were collected through a non-control group quasi-experimental design using pre-and post-tests with open-ended and post-exposure questionnaires. Qualitative data were collected through a focus group discussion and further analyzed using content analysis. Results: The quantitative pre-post test results showed an increased average score with significant differences in stigma and awareness of mental health problems. The content analysis showed that the Carpe Diem board game could help decrease stigma, increase awareness of mental health problems, and encourage peer engagement in health-seeking behavior. However, we also discovered that the board game needed improvements in its integration with the formal curriculum and real-life situations. Conclusion: Adding adjuvant interventions, such as game-based learning, to conventional psychoeducation strategies can improve awareness, decreasing stigma and positive peer involvement in health-seeking behaviors for adolescents' mental health in similar characteristics regions. Further improvement is still needed to improve the efficacy of the Carpe Diem. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - This randomized controlled trial tested the Family Assessment and Feedback Intervention (FAFI), a new intervention to enhance family engagement with emotional and behavioral health services. The FAFI is a guided conversation with families about results of their multidimensional assessment that is set in the context of motivational enhancement. It differs from other assessment-with-feedback interventions by extending the focus of assessment beyond the target child to parents and the family environment, addressing parental emotional and behavioral problems and competencies, spanning a broad range of children’s and parents’ strengths and difficulties, and being generalizable to many settings and practitioners. Participants were 81 families in primary care pediatrics. The FAFI was associated with a significant increase in parental mental health literacy and with an increase in parental attitudinal engagement with health supports and services that closely approached statistical significance (p =.052), while controlling for children’s age and gender and family socioeconomic status. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Background: Adolescents living with HIV are disproportionally affected by depression, which worsens antiretroviral therapy adherence, increases viral load, and doubles the risk of mortality. Because most adolescents living with HIV live in low- and middle-income countries, few receive depression treatment due to a lack of mental health services and specialists in low-resource settings. Chatbot technology, used increasingly in health service delivery, is a promising approach for delivering low-intensity depression care to adolescents living with HIV in resource-constrained settings. Objective: The goal of this study is to develop and pilot-test for the feasibility and acceptability of a prototype, optimized conversational agent (chatbot) to provide mental health education, self-help skills, and care linkage for adolescents living with HIV. Methods: Chatbot development comprises 3 phases conducted over 2 years. In the first phase (year 1), formative research will be conducted to understand the views, opinions, and preferences of up to 48 youths aged 10-19 years (6 focus groups of up to 8 adolescents living with HIV per group), their caregivers (5 in-depth interviews), and HIV program personnel (5 in-depth interviews) regarding depression among adolescents living with HIV. We will also investigate the perceived acceptability of a mental health chatbot, including barriers and facilitators to accessing and using a chatbot for depression care by adolescents living with HIV. In the second phase (year 1), we will iteratively program a chatbot using the SmartBot360 software with successive versions (0.1, 0.2, and 0.3), meeting regularly with a Youth Advisory Board comprised of adolescents living with HIV who will guide and inform the chatbot development and content to arrive at a prototype version (version 1.0) for pilot-testing. In the third phase (year 2), we will pilot-test the prototype chatbot among 50 adolescents living with HIV naïve to its development. Participants will interact with the chatbot for up to 2 weeks, and data will be collected on the acceptability of the chatbot-delivered depression education and self-help strategies, depression knowledge changes, and intention to seek care linkage. Results: The study was awarded in April 2022, received institutional review board approval in November 2022, received funding in December 2022, and commenced recruitment in March 2023. By the completion of study phases 1 and 2, we expect our chatbot to incorporate key needs and preferences gathered from focus groups and interviews to develop the chatbot. By the completion of study phase 3, we will have assessed the feasibility and acceptability of the prototype chatbot. Study phase 3 began in April 2024. Final results are expected by January 2025 and published thereafter. Conclusions: The study will produce a prototype mental health chatbot developed with and for adolescents living with HIV that will be ready for efficacy testing in a subsequent, larger study. © 2024 JMIR Publications Inc..

AB  - Efficiently conducting scientifically-grounded sports activities and harnessing the full potential of physical education in enhancing students' physical and mental well-being represents an area of active inquiry among educators. Addressing the imperative of enhancing physical exercise to regulate students' mental health, an investigative initiative advocating for the integration of physical exercise within a music teaching curriculum was proposed. The study employed an experimental research design, involving a survey conducted among 580 first and second-grade students at an experimental middle school within an urban setting. Out ofthe distributed 580 questionnaires, 530 valid responses were collected, comprising 280 male and 250 female students, resulting in a recovery rate of 93%. Both questionnaire and interview surveys were utilized during data collection, with the questionnaire survey serving as the primary method. Among the 530 valid responses obtained, findings revealed that 70% of middle school students exhibited good mental health, while 40% reported experiencing mild mental issues, 10% had moderate mental challenges, 2.4% demonstrated severe mental problems, and 0.8% exhibited extremely severe mental issues. Employing music therapy within music classroom instruction holds potential to enhance the mental health education of adolescents and elevate their psychological well-being. This practice contributes to fostering a positive classroom culture for school principals, facilitates effective student management, and enhances students' psychological resilience. The integration of music therapy into music education significantly impacts the holistic development ofjunior high school students' mental health. Notably, music instruction in junior middle schools inherently encompasses a plethora of teaching elements conducive to mental health education. In accordance with the nuanced dynamics of students' physical and psychological maturation, educators must diligently explore teaching resources, employ effective pedagogical approaches, engage in meaningful student dialogue, and prioritize the holistic well-being of students. This entails guiding students to cultivate a healthy psychological disposition aligned with the developmental trajectories of their physical and mental states, thereby enhancing their overall psychological resilience and character development. Music assumes a pivotal and multifaceted role in fostering the mental health development ofjunior high school students. Through the process of musical appreciation and learning, students are continually inspired to persevere, engage in proactive selfdevelopment, and endeavour to realize their life aspirations, ideals, and values. © 2024 Sociedad Revista de Psicologia del Deporte.

AB  - Background: Mental health (MH) problems in youth are prevalent, burdening, and frequently persistent. Despite the existence of effective treatment, the uptake of professional help is low, particularly due to attitudinal barriers. Objective: This study evaluated the effectiveness and acceptability of 2 video-based microinterventions aimed at reducing barriers to MH treatment and increasing the likelihood of seeking professional help in young people. Methods: This study was entirely web based and open access. The interventions addressed 5 MH problems: generalized anxiety disorder, depression, bulimia, nonsuicidal self-injury, and problematic alcohol use. Intervention 1 aimed to destigmatize and improve MH literacy, whereas intervention 2 aimed to induce positive outcome expectancies regarding professional help seeking. Of the 2435 participants who commenced the study, a final sample of 1394 (57.25%) participants aged 14 to 29 years with complete data and sufficient durations of stay on the video pages were randomized in a fully automated manner to 1 of the 5 MH problems and 1 of 3 conditions (control, intervention 1, and intervention 2) in a permuted block design. After the presentation of a video vignette, no further videos were shown to the control group, whereas a second, short intervention video was presented to the intervention 1 and 2 groups. Intervention effects on self-reported potential professional help seeking (primary outcome), stigma, and attitudes toward help seeking were examined using analyses of covariance across and within the 5 MH problems. Furthermore, we assessed video acceptability. Results: No significant group effects on potential professional help seeking were found in the total sample (F<inf>2,1385</inf>=0.99; P=.37). However, the groups differed significantly with regard to stigma outcomes and the likelihood of seeking informal help (F<inf>2,1385</inf>=3.75; P=.02). Furthermore, separate analyses indicated substantial differences in intervention effects among the 5 MH problems. Conclusions: Interventions to promote help seeking for MH problems may require disorder-specific approaches. The study results can inform future research and public health campaigns addressing adolescents and young adults. ©Diana Lemmer, Markus Moessner, Nicolas Arnaud, Harald Baumeister, Agnes Mutter, Sarah-Lena Klemm, Elisa König, Paul Plener, Christine Rummel-Kluge, Rainer Thomasius, Michael Kaess, Stephanie Bauer.

AB  - Ahead of the Game (AOTG) is a comprehensive multi-level, multi-component programme for adolescent males delivered through community sporting clubs and organisations. The programme includes four components, two interventions for adolescents targeting mental health literacy and resilience, a parent mental health literacy intervention, and an intervention for coaches aimed at helping them to facilitate self-determined motivation. AOTG is primarily a mental health promotion and prevention programme that also promotes early intervention for mental illness and available support services. Targeting mental health literacy, help-seeking, stigma, and resilience in adolescent males is important for a number of reasons. Mental disorders are recognised as one of the most prominent contributors to the global burden of disease among young people, and they carry significant personal, social, and economic costs that can last a lifetime. At both the individual intervention and full AOTG programme level, implementation has been shown to have meaningful benefits for adolescent male mental health. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Gavin Breslin and Gerard Leavey; individual chapters, the contributors.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate associations between physical activity levels and emotional and behavioural problems in school-going adolescents aged 14 to 17 years in Uganda. Methods: Two-hundred and five adolescents [median (interquartile range) age = 16.0 (1.0) years; female = 61.9%] completed the interviewer-administered Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 questionnaire (GAD-7), and the Physical Activity Vital Sign (PAVS) measure. Spearman’s rho correlations and Mann–Whitney U-tests were applied. Results: Among 205 adolescents, 97.1% were physically inactive (PAVS < 420min/week), while 64.4% reported either mild depressive (PHQ-9 ≥ 5) or anxiety (GAD-7 ≥ 5) symptoms. Higher PAVS scores correlated significantly with lower SDQ emotional problems (ρ = −0.23, p < 0.001), lower PHQ-9 (ρ = −0.26, p < 0.001), and lower GAD-7 (ρ = −0.22, p < 0.001) scores. Those with emotional problems (SDQ ≥ 5) (n = 86) were significantly less physically active than those without (n = 119) [30.0 (62.5) versus 60.0 (105.0) min/week, p < 0.001]. Those with depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 ≥ 5) were significantly less physically active than those without [35.0 (70.0) versus 60.0 (120.0) min/week, p < 0.001]. Conclusion: Physical inactivity and mental health problems are related important public health concerns in school-going adolescents in low-income countries such as Uganda. The efficacy and effectiveness of school-based mental health literacy programs, including physical activity promotion, should be explored in these low-resource settings. © 2024 NISC Pty Ltd.

AB  - Background: Parental mental illness (PMI) is common and places children at high risk of developing psychological disorders. Family Talk (FT) is a well-known, whole-family, 7-session intervention designed to reduce the risk of transgenerational psychopathology. However, very few larger-scale evaluations of FT (across only a limited number of settings) have been conducted to date while there have been no cost analyses. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and costs of delivering FT in improving child and family psychosocial functioning in families with PMI within routine mental health settings. Methods: A total of 83 families with PMI, with children aged 5-18 years, were randomly assigned on a 2:1 ratio to receive either the FT intervention (n=55 families) or usual services (n=28 families) across 10 adult, child and primary care mental health sites in Ireland. Parental disorders included anxiety/depression (57%), Bipolar Disorder (20%), Borderline Personality Disorder (12%), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (8%) and psychosis (2%). Detailed assessments with parents were conducted at baseline and 6-month follow up. Results: FT led to significant improvements in family functioning and child behaviour at 6-month follow up when compared to usual services, with medium effect sizes indicated. Parent participants with lower mental health literacy at baseline also showed significant post-intervention improvements. Those parents with less severe mental illness at baseline, and families with more partner and economic supports, reported additional significant post-intervention improvements in child depression/anxiety and parental mental health symptoms. The cost of FT amounted to €761.50 per family, although this decreased to €415.31 when recurring costs only were included. Conclusion: The findings from this study, which was conducted within the context of a national programme to introduce family-focused practice in Ireland, demonstrate that FT is a low-cost intervention that improved child and family psychosocial functioning across different mental health disorders within routine adult, child and primary care mental health services. The findings contribute to the growing evidence base for FT, and provide a robust basis to inform practice and policy development for families with parental mental illness both in Ireland and elsewhere.

AB  - Individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR) report a strong desire for psychoeducation, and clinical guidelines recommend psychoeducation in early psychosis care. Although several CHR psychoeducation models have been developed, additional research is needed to establish the effectiveness of these models. The goal of this study was to conduct a pilot trial of the Brief Educational Guide for Individuals in Need (BEGIN). BEGIN is a brief structured psychoeducation intervention designed to educate CHR individuals on symptoms and treatment options. We conducted a feasibility and pilot study of 25 CHR individuals (60% female, Mage = 20.6, 64% non-White, 52% Hispanic/Latino) identified via the Structured Interview for Psychosis Risk Syndromes. Qualitative interviews were administered to learn about their experience and analyzed using iterative thematic analysis. Participants (n = 12) completed pre- and post-BEGIN self-report measures to assess factors that influence treatment engagement, including CHR knowledge and motivation for therapy. Data were analyzed using Hedges’ g effect sizes and paired samples t tests. The intervention completion rate (83%) and therapeutic alliance were high. Qualitative themes and quantitative measures converged on similar results showing how CHR individuals were impacted by receiving psychoeducation via BEGIN, including increased CHR knowledge (g = 1.37), competence to monitor symptoms (g = 0.53), hope (g = 0.87), and motivation for therapy (g = 0.46). This study demonstrated the feasibility, acceptability, and potential benefits of the BEGIN CHR psychoeducation model, including enhancing motivation for treatment. The flexible but standardized format can facilitate BEGIN’s implementation and dissemination. © 2024 American Psychological Association

AB  - Objective: The National Mental Health Services (N-MHSs) in Iran was integrated with Primary Health Care (PHC) in 1988. This study aimeds to analyze the policy of integrating N-MHSs in PHC, focusing on the analysis of the current situation, pathology, and the existing challenge. Method: This qualitative research was conducted in 2020 using a case study approach. This study used the policy triangle model to analyze the policy. The required data were collected via interviews, literature review, and document analysis. The interviews were conducted with 23 experts, stakeholders across the country who were selected through purposive sampling, and the data were analyzed using the content-analysis method. Results: The main goals of this policy were to raise mental health literacy among the people and eliminate its stigma in the society, while implementing the referral system for N-MHSs. Twenty weaknesses were extracted in eight areas, including negative views of mental health, weaknesses in human resource training, compensation for the service of psychologists, unfavorable working conditions of the workforce, inappropriate service delivery facilities, lack of meaningful communication between different levels of service delivery, poor inter-sectorial communication, and the challenging nature of mental health care. De-stigmatizing psychological disorders in the society and identifying hidden patients are some of the most significant achievements of this policy. Conclusion: Despite the successful implementation and significant achievements in integrating N-MHSs in PHC, the results of the present study indicate that there are many challenges in this field that require serious planning and attention from relevant authorities. © 2024 Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

AB  - Adolescents are facing an unprecedented mental health crisis worldwide. Yet, mental health literacy and experiences of mental illness vary significantly with gender. For example, male deaths by suicide are twice as high as females on average globally, with the trend of gender disparity in mental illness emerging in high school and continuing into adulthood. With the majority of mental illnesses also emerging in adolescence, high schools are uniquely positioned to provide timely preventative mental health education for boys. To date, however, school-based mental health education programs are predominantly gender-neutral. We conducted a narrative review of the literature in mental health education programs for high school aged boys aged 12–18 years within schools and the wider community. To address the question How can high schools provide better mental health education for their male students? searches were undertaken in four databases, ProQuest (including ERIC), Informit (including A+ Education), PsychINFO and Google Scholar, between January 2021 and November 2023. There were no restrictions on publication date. Our findings suggested that to improve mental health knowledge and attitudes towards mental health and help seeking, school-based programs should be gender transformative, draw on best practice and theory in sociology, psychology, and boys’ pedagogy, utilise co-design so that student voice can be prioritised, and be tailored to the school's sociocultural context. Recommendations for schools are discussed. © 2024

AB  - Background: Adolescents’ mental health literacy is a topic of growing interest and studies have begun to explore the factors that influence adolescents’ mental health literacy. This study investigated the relationship between parents’ mental health literacy and adolescents’ mental health literacy, as well as the mediating roles of parent-child relationship, and the moderating roles of school mental health service. Methods: Questionnaires were distributed to adolescents and their parents at two time points with an interval of one month. In the first survey, 835 parents completed a mental health literacy scale and a parent-child relationship scale. In the second, 841 adolescents completed a school mental health service questionnaire and an adolescent mental health literacy assessment questionnaire. A total of 617 paired data points were matched (parents’ age: M = 40.47, SD = 5.10; adolescents’ age: M = 13.34, SD = 0.99). Results: Bootstrapping results showed that parents’ mental health literacy was positively associated with adolescents’ mental health literacy. In addition, parent-child intimacy mediated the relationship between parents’ mental health literacy and adolescents’ mental health literacy. School mental health service moderated the relationship between parents’ mental health literacy and parent-child intimacy and adolescents’ mental health literacy. Conclusion: Intergenerational transmission of mental health literacy from parents to adolescents and its conditions were revealed. These findings provide new insights for the intervention of adolescents’ mental health literacy, and may lead future research to investigate the role of parents within the family context, as well as the influence of home-school cooperation on adolescents’ mental health literacy. © 2024 Wang et al.

AB  - BACKGROUND // Different studies identify mental health literacy as a protective factor for developing a mental health problem. The aim of this paper was to determine the degree of mental health literacy of the adolescent population of Barcelona, and its relationship with socio-demographic and educational variables. METHODS // A cross-sectional study was carried out in Barcelona during the 2017-2018 academic year. A total of 1,032 young people between thirteen and seventeen years of age participated. The following variables were collected: sex, age, nationality, socioeconomic status (RDHpc) and average school grade. The aim was to determine the degree of mental health literacy (knowledge, stigma and help-seeking) of the adolescent population of Barcelona, and its relationship with socio-demographic and educational variables. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed adjusting for the effect of sociodemographic variables on the score of each scale. RESULTS // The mean score (standard deviation) of the EMHL test was 7.28 (1.27) and 4.24 (1.14) respectively, with higher scores obtained by girls, high RDHpc, excellent score and Spanish nationality. The greatest difference in EMHL scores, adjusting for the rest of the variables, corresponded to adolescents with an excellent mean score and a high RDHpc index (with respect to the baseline category, beta=0.72 and 0.52 respectively). The mean stigma score was 27.6 (4.47) for CAMI and 8.83 (3.36) for RIBS. The variables related to a greater difference in score with respect to the baseline category and adjusted for the rest of the variables were: gender (boy=1.54) and academic grade (excellent=-2.38) for CAMI, and nationality (foreign=0.82) and academic grade (excellent=-1.30) for RIBS. The mean RIBS score was 8.83 (3.36) with the largest difference in score from baseline being foreign nationality (beta=0.82) and having a grade of excellent (1.30). Help-seeking was higher in parents and friends, with differences according to gender and nationality. CONCLUSIONS // The level of mental health literacy is medium-low. While gender, nationality and educational attainment are the factors that are related to knowledge and stigma, socio-economic status is only related to mental health literacy. © 2024 Ministerio de Sanidad y Consumo.

AB  - Secondary school students are at risk for mental health problems, especially nowadays, when we face an increase in mental health issues among adolescents and the general population. Mental health literacy (MHL) and help-seeking behavior are considered protective factors; however, we lack data on the levels of MHL in secondary school students and how MHL is developed in schools. This correlational and comparative study was designed to investigate mental health literacy (MHL) and help-seeking behavior among secondary school students in Slovakia. A convenient sample of 250 Slovak secondary school students responded to an anonymous online survey consisting of two scales (Mental Health Literacy Scale and Self-stigma of Seeking Help). Significant differences in mental health literacy (t(248) = 5.56; p ≤ 0.0) and stigma of seeking help (t(248) = −4.33; p ≤ 0.01) were observed between students in general and vocational secondary school. Students in general secondary school who attended optional psychology courses had the highest scores in mental health literacy (U = 987; p = 0.003). These preliminary findings showed that secondary students with a higher level of mental health literacy reported a lower level of self-stigmatization related to seeking professional mental health help (r = −0.339; p ≤ 0.01). Implementing mental health education into secondary school curricula can potentially help increase mental health literacy and decrease self-stigma of seeking help. © © 2024 Sokolová.

AB  - Objective: To determine the impact of the SARSCoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic and lockdowns on the mental health status, training, perceptions of the physiotherapy profession, and career plans of French physiotherapy students. Design: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted, representing the first and only survey of its kind, using a national online survey. Subjects: A total of 2678 French physiotherapy students participated in the study. Methods: Mental health status was assessed using the validated French versions of established depression, anxiety, and insomnia scales. Results: The survey revealed that female sex, age below 21 years, living alone, and having a psychiatric history or COVID-19 risk factors were associated with more severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia in the surveyed students. In addition, stress, anxiety, and depression induced by the COVID-19 crisis were linked to apprehension about continuing practical training in physiotherapy. These factors also affected students’ perceptions of the profession and the initially envisioned mode of practice, particularly among fifth-year students (odds ratio (OR) = 2.25, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = (1.69, 2.99), p < 0.001). Notably, the pandemic significantly reduced the desire of these students to pursue a career as physiotherapists (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.41 (1.06, 1.86)). Conclusion: French physiotherapy students, especially those in their fifth year, have experienced significant impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, affecting their mental health, education, perceptions of the physiotherapy profession, and career plans. © 2024, Medical Journals Sweden AB.

AB  - This paper combines the stepwise regression algorithm as well as the decision tree algorithm to design a decision tree stepwise regression algorithm model of the impact of the big Civics program on students' mental health. This paper focuses on the use of a stepwise regression algorithm to eliminate the independent variables that do not have a significant impact on the dependent variable, and through the decision tree, ID3 method to test all the features, in-depth exploration of the degree of influence of the large courses of ideology and politics on students' mental health. In order to be able to more deeply solve the degree of influence of the large course of thought and politics on students' mental health, a oneway linear regression analysis is carried out on the basis of the relevant analysis data of students' mental health. The results show that the histogram of the independent variable of the large course of ideology and the dependent variable of the total mean score is distributed in a normal curve, with a mean of 2.82E-16, a standard deviation of 0.999, and a correlation coefficient squared of 0.057, which indicates that the large course of ideology has a predictive effect on the mental health of students and that the students' anorexia mental health is influenced by the large course of ideology by 0.057. This study shows that the large course of ideology is able to promote the physical and mental health development of students and contribute to the mental health of the students. This study shows that the large ideology and politics program can promote the healthy development of student's physical and mental health, provide a direction for mental health education to become an effective carrier of "moral education", and also provide a breakthrough point for the reform and innovation of students' mental health education. © 2023 Yan Liu, published by Sciendo.

AB  - Schools play a crucial role in promoting the mental health of children and adolescents. This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of a mental health program by evaluating changes in knowledge, behavior, and mental health outcomes of students before and after the intervention. The study employed a pre-and-post-test quasi-experimental approach in four selected high schools in Bogor. It evaluated changes in knowledge, behavior, and mental health outcomes of students pre-and-post the intervention. The study assessed mental health literacy, anti-bullying education, and creating a positive school environment. Data were collected in July and October 2019, with 476 out of 495 students completing both pre- and post-tests. In the intervention group, there was an improvement in knowledge, as evidenced by a decrease in the risk of “having a lack of knowledge” from the pre-test (OR = 1.8, 95% CI [1.2, 2.6], p = .004) to the post-test (OR = 1.2, 95% CI [0.9, 1.8], p = .284). During the pre-test period, students in the intervention schools had a higher risk of experiencing bullying (OR = 1.4, 95% CI [0.9, 2.3], p = .133). However, after the intervention, their risk of being bullied decreased (OR = 0.9, 95% CI [0.6, 1.6], p = .810). The risk of having no peer support also decreased from OR = 1.6, 95% CI [0.5, 5.8], p = .467 to OR = 1.1, 95% CI [0.3, 4.3], p = .933. The condition of depression in the intervention group improved, with an OR = 1.0, 95% CI [0.6, 1.8], p = .924 at the pre-test and an OR = 0.8, 95% CI [0.4, 1.6], p = .511 at the post-test. These findings underscore the significance of initiatives focused on improving student mental health. © 2024, Mahidol University. All rights reserved.

AB  - By addressing the academic imperative for mental health education and crisis intervention, this exploratory study evaluates the desirability and availability of undergraduate education in recognizing and supporting mental health conditions and crises in hospitality and tourism industry settings. Hospitality and tourism management faculty and undergraduate students were surveyed through an online survey. The majority of faculty and students agreed mental health is important to learn in the classroom to prepare for industry, yet the majority have neither taught nor learned about mental health education and crisis intervention. The findings contribute to how educational leadership influences mental health training integration in classroom instruction. Recommendations included conducting feasibility studies with hospitality management educators on the integration of mental health in classroom learning; conducting larger, more generalizable studies on the effects of such education; and integrating effective mental health and crisis intervention training for hospitality management educators and students into curricula across the field. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - The mental health of young people in youth sport has received growing academic attention and sporting clubs are identified as important settings for prevention and early intervention. Despite this, very few studies have explored the perceptions of multiple stakeholders about youth sporting clubs as spaces for mental health awareness, education, and training. The purpose of the study was to understand the capacity of youth sporting clubs 1 to become a site for general mental health support and explore parents, coaches, club leaders and youth participants perceptions about their sporting club’s readiness for mental health awareness, education, and training initiatives. Using an Interpretive Description (ID) research methodology, 26 participants (parents, youth, club leaders/coaches) involved in community-level youth sport participated in a qualitative telephone interview. Data was analyzed thematically, leading to the construction of three themes about the barriers for building and maintaining a culture of mental health support in youth sport: (a) initial resistance, (b) teething issues and (c) turbulence. The themes reflected perceptions about varying levels of club readiness for meaningfully supporting positive mental health and indicated that many youth sporting clubs may find it difficult to sustain long-term, positive change. The study suggests that while sport can be a promising avenue to promote positive mental health, it is not without multiple forms of resistance, which if not navigated, may discourage efforts to establish and maintain club settings as sites for mental health, education, awareness, and first aid training. Implications for the field are discussed.  Lay Summary: Parents, youth sport participants and club leaders/coaches were interviewed for the purpose of understanding their views of youth sporting clubs’ capacity to become a site for mental health support. The thematic findings suggest that clubs are differentially equipped to support meaningful cultural change surrounding mental health and sport.PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Clubs seeking to become a site for mental health support encounter various barriers and therefore display differential levels of “readiness” for change. To meaningfully and sustainably create clubs that support mental health, additional intervention methods are necessary to support mental health education, awareness-raising activities and first aid training in youth sport. © 2023 Association for Applied Sport Psychology.

AB  - Objective: An estimated 41,000 lives are lost to suicide each year in World Health Organization Eastern Mediterranean Region Office (WHO EMRO) countries. The objective of this study was to conduct a situation analysis for suicide and self-harm in the WHO EMRO region. Methods: Data on suicide were obtained from the WHO Global Health Estimates for the years 2000–2019. Information on risk groups efforts to prevent self-harm and suicide in the EMRO region were retrieved through scientific studies, grey literature, and public websites. Results: During 2000–2019, the age-standardized suicide rate was 6.7 per 100,000 inhabitants, albeit there are concerns regarding data quality. Self-harm and suicide remain criminal acts in more than half of the countries. Few countries have a national plan for prevention of suicide. Toxic agents, such as pesticides and black henna, are easily available and frequently used for suicide in some areas, as are firearms and self-immolation. Successful prevention measures include means restriction and psychosocial interventions after self-harm. Conclusion: Many WHO EMRO countries remain underserved in terms of mental health care. Decriminalization of suicide and means restriction might be further promoted. Online-based tools for mental health literacy and psychosocial therapy are other options to explore. © 2023 International Academy for Suicide Research.

AB  - Background: Two of the most common modifiable barriers to help-seeking for mental health problems during adolescence are stigma and poor mental health literacy. However, relatively little is known about stigma as it relates to suicide, and knowledge about suicidality in this age group. Aims: To assess levels of suicide literacy and suicide attitudes in an adolescent sample, and to identify correlates of these constructs. Methods: Data were drawn from the pre-intervention survey of the Sources of Strength Australia Project. A total of 1019 adolescents aged between 11 and 17 years participated. Suicide literacy and attitudes were measured alongside potential correlates including psychological distress, suicidal ideation, mastery, previous exposure to suicidal thinking and behaviour, and demographics. Results: Participants more strongly endorsed attitudes attributing suicide to isolation/depression, compared to attitudes glorifying or stigmatising suicide. Gaps in knowledge about suicide included the risk factors, signs and symptoms. Key correlates of suicide attitudes and literacy included age, gender and cultural background. Conclusion: Findings highlight the need for further education activities in schools and public awareness campaigns that address the gaps in suicide knowledge and attitudes. Such activities would assist in the identification of suicide risk among young people and improve help-seeking in this population. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Engaging young men in mental health promotion initiatives is important given the negative attitudes toward mental health and increased suicide rates, reported by young men. Ahead of the Game (AOTG) is a sport-based, psychoeducational initiative which uses sports as a mental health and resilience promotional medium. This study sought contribute to the literature on the effectiveness of the AOTG program by exploring for whom, and through what mechanisms, the intervention works. A secondary analysis of the AOTG randomized controlled trial was conducted, which comprised a sample of 350 adolescent male sport-playing participants (M = 14.53 years, SD = 1.19 years) and control group of 466 sport participants (M = 14.66 years, SD = 1.39), various mental health related measures were taken at baseline and at approximately 8 weeks follow-up. Moderation analyses were conducted to examine age, socioeconomic status, and baseline measures of mental health as potential moderators of program effects. Mediation analyses were run to explore whether changes in psychological distress and wellbeing were mediated by changes in AOTG’s various primary mental health related outcomes. Results indicated age did not moderate any effects of AOTG. Meanwhile, socioeconomic status and baseline help seeking, implicit beliefs, and psychological distress all showed signs of moderating main effects of AOTG. Mediation analyses revealed that changes in resilience and implicit beliefs partially mediated changes in psychological distress. Further, increased resilience had an indirect effect of on athletes’ wellbeing. The implications and future directions, in light of these findings, are explored. Lay summary: Ahead of the Game was shown to be effective regardless of age and particularly beneficial for those in low socioeconomic, displaying low levels of help seeking, and those with higher psychological distress. Increasing resilience was also shown to be an important pathway for increasing wellbeing and reducing distress. © 2023 Association for Applied Sport Psychology.

AB  - In Canada, addressing the health literacy needs of children and their communities has largely been taken on by the health sector. The education system has also played a role in addressing health literacy and in collaboration with public health, interest groups, and community agencies has focused on addressing mental health literacy and nutrition literacy. Currently, efforts to address health literacy of groups that have lower health outcomes in Canada have been few and have included limited work with Indigenous peoples and newcomers to Canada. There are two main challenges to the growth and spread of approaches to meet the health literacy needs of children and their communities in Canada. These are (1) lack of a national strategy and (2) lack of communication between programs that become siloed in different parts of the country. There are several ways that the need for improved communication and sharing of resources can be addressed. These ways include ensuring collaborative design, addressing cultural safety in healthcare, fostering communities of practice, and addressing the use of technology and social media. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Introduction: Suicide rates among adolescents and young people are increasing, especially in Western countries. Suicidal ideation often precedes suicide attempts and suicide. Yet, research involving individuals with lived experience in suicide prevention, especially among young adults, remains scarce. Understanding their needs is crucial for effective interventions. This qualitative study aims to explore the needs and perspectives of young adults with lived experience to provide tailored recommendations for suicide prevention. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 19 young adults who had experienced suicidal ideation within the past two years. Open-ended questions addressed the needs for help and support regarding suicide prevention. Data was thematically analyzed and, through an iterative process involving discussion among all authors, categorized into six themes. Results: The results indicated needs around more openness and understanding of suicide among the general public, advocating mental health education starting from a young age, reducing barriers in mental health care such as long waiting lists and enhancing informal support systems by facilitating online and offline peer connections. Participants also highlighted contemporary concerns such as social welfare, academic pressure, and social media as significant needs in the current time. Conclusion: This study highlights the necessity for comprehensive suicide prevention approaches catering to the diverse needs of young adults with recent suicidal ideation. It highlights the urgency of societal awareness, early mental health education, and improved access to services. Informal support networks and addressing societal stressors are also deemed crucial. Structural changes are urged to create supportive environments. 2024 Looijmans, Elzinga, Popma, van Bergen, Gilissen and Mérelle.

AB  - This chapter examines the evolution of adolescent mental health within the context of public education. A historical review of education policy provides the backdrop from which treatment and literacy of mental health in schools began and through which current initiatives are developing. A specific focus is given to the processes and resources within school settings that work to prevent mental health problems for adolescents. When schools employ evidence-based curricula and practices that teach social and emotional competencies, they help promote mental health literacy and serve a fundamental role in the prevention and early intervention of mental illness among students. Through an integration of two prevention-focused frameworks, social-emotional learning (SEL) and multitiered system of supports (MTSS), a sustainable foundation of positive prevention can be established and can offer schools a viable alternative to the “wait-and-fail” model that traditionally has been used to identify struggling students. Schools’ efforts can be further strengthened by coordinating and collaborating with community partners, especially those in the mental health and public health fields. Through shared responsibility, a convergence of evidence-based practices, and braiding or blending of resources, the need for high level services can be reduced and the research-to-practice gap can be closed, but only when implementation is guided by implementation science. When these efforts are employed, schools have a prime opportunity to prevent mental illness among adolescents and to intervene early when additional supports are needed instead of waiting until a crisis occurs. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - This book presents an innovative public mental health model addressing the global crisis of declining mental health among adolescents. Despite the scholarly and public media attention given to post-pandemic adolescent mental health, few published sources present a sustainable, scalable and multisector collaborative solution that includes attention to the social determinants of health, equity, and prevention, together with mental health literacy education and early intervention. This book takes a public health approach to address this need and is inspired by the authors' experience creating and implementing change in adolescent mental health systems. While prevention, together with diagnosis and treatment, are the most effective ways to address mental illness, a systems-level approach has only recently appeared in the applied mental health scientific literature. Unlike cardiovascular disease and cancer, mental health promotion and mental illness prevention have been slow to gain traction in the U.S. However, leading professional associations are beginning to acknowledge the value of a public health approach to adolescent mental health and the need to support public health and mental health intersectoral policies. The concepts presented in this volume draw on three primary systems: public health, mental health and education. The authors present 24 recommendations that are relevant for scholars, practitioners and leaders involved in adolescent mental health. Among the topics covered: • U.S. and global adolescent mental health, public health, and school mental health • Why a systems change is needed in adolescent mental health • How to implement an adolescent public mental health model • Taking action with systems change Adolescent Public Mental Health is essential reading for professionals in mental health, public health, social work, and medicine who are interested in moving to a more integrative, multisectoral approach to adolescent mental health. Educators and academic institutions who teach our future leaders will benefit from understanding the new model, which can be seamlessly included in secondary school education. Clinicians, practitioners, school principals and superintendents can adopt the model and collaborative processes, described in the demonstration project, to respond to the mental health challenges they encounter every day. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Aim: To explore the individual and interpersonal association between mental health knowledge (MHK) and depression in adolescents and one of their parents, and to explore whether gender differences exist between fathers and mothers in these associations. Methods: Participants were 3456 father–adolescent dyads and 4478 mother–adolescent dyads, recruited from eight middle schools in Wuhan, who completed self-report assessments of MHK and depression from September to October 2021. Results: With the application of the actor–partner interdependence model, A positive actor effect between MHK and depression in adolescents was found. Adverse partner effects from fathers' MHK and mothers' MHK to adolescent depression were noted and showed no significant difference. Adolescents' depression was significantly associated with parental depression in both fathers and mothers. Conclusion: It is implied that milder adolescent depression was associated with lower levels of adolescent MHK, along with higher levels of MHK in both fathers and mothers. For parents, it is important to emphasise the improvement of their own MHK and increase their attention to adolescent mental health problems, as this may contribute to enhancing the mental health of adolescents. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care: This study is instructive and related to family-based nursing interventions for mental health, emphasising the potential influence of parents in the family on adolescent depressive symptoms. The findings suggest that parental involvement should be encouraged and that the family's role in supporting the child's mental health should be recognised, contributing to the development of relevant policies. Impact: This study highlights that higher parental MHK is associated with lower levels of adolescent depression, with no gender differences between fathers and mothers. Family-based nursing interventions that emphasise mental health education for parents may have an impact on improving depression in adolescents. Reporting Method: Guidelines were followed using the STROBE reporting method. Patient or Public Contribution: None. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Perceived treatment urgency of mental disorders are important as they determine utilization of health care. The aim was to analyze variations in perceived treatment urgency in cases of psychosis (adolescents), alcoholism (adults), and depression (older adults) with two levels of severity each by characteristics of the case and the respondents. A telephone survey (N = 1200) with vignettes describing cases of psychosis, alcoholism, and depression was conducted in Hamburg, Germany. Vignettes varied by symptom severity and sex. Perceived treatment urgency was assessed by three items. A sum scale was calculated. Linear regression models were computed to analyze differences in perceived urgency by characteristics of the case (severity, sex) and the respondents (sex, age, education, migration background, illness recognition, personal affliction). Perceived treatment urgency was significantly higher in severe cases and varied by education. Additionally, regarding psychosis, estimated urgency varied significantly by correct illness recognition. With regard to depression, perceived urgency differed significantly by age and correct illness recognition. Interaction effects between case severity and sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents, personal affliction, and correct recognition of the disorder were found. The identified differences should be considered in the development of interventions on mental health literacy with regard to adequate urgency assessment. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Recent surveys show rising numbers of young people who report anxiety and depression. Although much attention has focused on mental health of adolescent youth, less attention has been paid to young people as they transition into adulthood. Multiple factors may have contributed to this steady increase: greater exposure to social media, information, and distressing news via personal electronic devices; increased concerns regarding social determinants of health and climate change; and changing social norms due to increased mental health literacy and reduced stigma. The COVID-19 pandemic may have temporarily exacerbated symptoms and impacted treatment availability. Strategies to mitigate causal factors for depression and anxiety in young adults may include education and skills training for cognitive, behavioral, and social coping strategies, as well as healthier use of technology and social media. Policies must support the availability of health insurance and treatment, and clinicians can adapt interventions to encompass the specific concerns and needs of young adults. © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Background: Identifying locally relevant and agreed-upon priorities for improving young people’s mental health, aligned with social and environmental factors, is essential for benefiting target communities. This paper describes a participatory approach to engage young people and professionals in identifying such priorities, whilst considering the social determinants related to them. Methods: We utilised a community-based participatory approach to support young people and professionals in identifying, reviewing, refining, and prioritising, locally relevant opportunity areas that are crucial for understanding and addressing social determinants of young people’s mental health. We adopted a flexible five-stage process, which enabled greater reflection and adaptation in response to young people’s and professionals’ feedback and reflections. Results: Over seven months, we engaged with young people and professionals in Northern Devon, (a rural area in southwest England), involving over 290 individuals to identify locally relevant priorities for supporting young people’s mental health. Three priorities were identified for subsequent exploration using co-design approaches: (1) identity and belonging; (2) mental health awareness and literacy; and (3) diverse opportunities (for education, employment and leisure). The engagements suggested that designing initiatives and strategies in these areas could contribute to improvements in young people’s mental health. Conclusion: Young people in Northern Devon prioritised three themes for the next phase of the Kailo Programme—mental health literacy, access to diverse careers and employment opportunities, and identity and belonging within their communities. Rural communities face unique barriers associated with these issues, related to less diverse populations, lack of access to reliable and affordable transport and local industries, and seasonal working. The perceived neglect by authorities towards rural young people has resulted in a lack of activities and opportunities catering to their specific needs, compared to urban areas. Although the government has recognised the need to address these disparities, community members suggest that there is still more work to be done. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Most mental health problems develop during youth, with about three quarter emerging before age 25. In adolescence, stigmatizing attitudes related to mental illness become more nuanced and consolidate into one’s belief system. As the stigma of mental illness is still one of the leading barriers to help-seeking, intervention measures should explicitly address it before it becomes entrenched over time. Preventive measures, for example, based on promoting mental health literacy (MHL), can be used to address and tackle stigmatizing attitudes. The Canadian MHL-based intervention “the Guide” was translated and adapted for the use in German schools. The present study evaluates the effect of the German version of the Guide on attitudes towards mental illness among students in Germany. Methods: The first-time application of the Guide (German version) was evaluated with a pre-post-evaluation study with an intervention and a control group. The evaluation data of 188 students (intervention group n = 106, control group n = 82) were statistically analyzed focusing on the outcomes social stigma, social distance, and self-stigma. Results: The analysis showed that participants do not tend to hold stigmatizing attitudes even before the intervention. Nevertheless, the intervention was effective in reducing social stigma, but not in reducing social distance and self-stigma. Neither gender, pre-existing experience with mental illness, nor the delivery modality of the contact element within the intervention (speaker vs. video) seemed to influence the outcomes. Conclusions: The German version of the MHL-based intervention, the Guide, seems to be a suitable intervention to improve attitudes towards mental illness among students in Germany. More extensive research is necessary to confirm the findings and further explore factors that influence the program’s effects on attitudes short- and long-term. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Objectives: This study aims to provide a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature on The Effect of Web-Based Educational Interventions on Mental Health Literacy, Stigma and Help-seeking intentions/attitudes in young people. Methods: Articles in English published between April 1975 and February 2023 were retrieved from seven databases, leading to a total of 2023 articles identified. Results: 20 studies were included after applying exclusion criteria, 10 of which were eligible for meta-analysis. Results showed that web-based educational interventions had a significant positive effect on mental health literacy knowledge (SMD = 0.70, 95% CI = [0.16, 1.25]), but not on stigma (SMD = -0.20, 95% CI = [-0.48, 0.08]) or help-seeking intentions/attitudes (SMD = 0.48, 95% CI = [-0.50, 1.46]). Conclusion: This study reviewed and analyzed the effect of web-based educational interventions on mental health literacy, stigma, and help-seeking intentions/attitudes among young people. The results showed that web-based educational interventions improved mental health literacy knowledge, but not stigma or help-seeking outcomes. The study suggested several recommendations to enhance the effectiveness of web-based educational interventions on stigma and help-seeking outcomes, such as using more rigorous designs and methods, more comprehensive and multifaceted interventions, more tailored and targeted interventions, and more collaborative and participatory approaches. The study concluded that web-based educational interventions may have a greater impact on reducing stigma and promoting help-seeking among young people, which may ultimately lead to better mental health outcomes and well-being for this population. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - School-age children frequently present with mental health (MH) problems in school, affecting their academic experience and outcomes. However, school staff report difficulty in identifying and managing such problems. We aimed to determine whether a mental health literacy (MHL) intervention was effective at improving MHL for staff in an urban, predominately Latinx elementary school. A pre/post quasi-experimental design was used. A 20-week MHL intervention that is comprehensive (i.e., not disorder specific) and tiered (i.e., universal as well as targeted services for those with greater needs) was provided as part of an existing school-based mental health prevention and promotion program. A survey adapted from validated measures of MH knowledge and attitudes (including self-efficacy and stigma), as well as use of student support services, was simultaneously administered to staff at the intervention school and a matched comparison school before and after the intervention. Linear and logistic regressions assessed whether changes in MHL and rates of MH referrals varied by school. After controlling for pre-intervention scores, staff in the intervention school had significantly higher knowledge scores (data), higher self-efficacy scores (data), and lower stigma scores (data) in the post-intervention period compared to the comparison school. Following the intervention, more staff in the intervention school reported utilizing student supports to discuss student needs (OR 5.8, 95% CI 2.3–14.6). This intervention, which utilizes a social–ecological framework and tiered approach, led to improvements in MHL of school staff, which may facilitate staff ability to identify and support students’ MH needs. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: The Mental Health Support Scale for Adolescents (MHSSA) is a criterion-referenced measure of adolescents’ supportive intentions towards peers with mental health problems, which was developed for use in evaluations of adolescent mental health interventions, such as the teen Mental Health First Aid (tMHFA) program. The present study aimed to examine the validity and reliability of the MHSSA. Methods: A sample of 3092 school students (Mean ± SD: 15.9 ± 0.4 years old) and 65 tMHFA Instructors (the adult group with known expertise in tMHFA) completed the 12 items of the MHSSA. A sub-sample of 1201 students repeated the scale after a 3-4-week interval. Item concordance rates with the tMHFA Action Plan across helpful and harmful intentions scales were calculated. Scale reliabilities were assessed using agreement coefficients from a single test administration and test-retest reliability measured by intraclass correlation coefficients. The mean differences of MHSSA scores of students and Instructors were compared using independent samples t-tests, while convergent validity was tested via correlations of the scale with validated measures of confidence in providing help, social distance and personal stigma. Results: The average score of Instructors was significantly higher than that of students. The scale was positively associated with confidence in providing help, whilst negatively associated with social distance and dimensions of personal stigma. All scales of MHSSA had high agreement coefficients (all > 0.80) and fair to good test-retest reliability over 3–4 weeks. Conclusions: The MHSSA shows evidence of validity and reliability for use among adolescents for evaluating the quality of intentions to help peers with mental health problems. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: The Improving Mental Health Literacy Among Children and Young People in Indonesia (IMPeTUs) intervention is a co-produced, evidence-based digital intervention designed to improve anxiety and depression focused mental health literacy and self-management among people aged 11–15 in Java, Indonesia. This study aimed to evaluate the usability, feasibility and preliminary impact of our intervention. Methods: Mixed methods, multi-site case studies based on a theory of change. Pre-and post-assessments of a range of outcomes and qualitative interviews/focus groups with children and young people (CYP), parents and facilitators. The intervention was implemented in 8 health, school and community sites across Java, Indonesia (Megelang, Jakarta and Bogor). Quantitative data designed to understand the impact of and feasibility of evaluating the intervention collected from 78 CYP who used the intervention were analysed descriptively. Qualitative data from interviews and focus groups collected from 56 CYP, 49 parents/caregivers and 18 facilitators were analysed using framework analysis. Results: Qualitative data analysis indicated high levels of usability and acceptability for the interface aesthetic, personalisation, message presentation and navigation. Participants reported minimal burden and no negative outcomes associated with the intervention. CYP, parents and facilitators identified a range of direct and spill over effects of interventions engagement, some of which were not anticipated at study outset. Quantitative data highlighted the feasibility of intervention evaluation, with high levels of recruitment and retention across study time points. Minimal changes were identified in outcomes pre-to-post intervention, which may in part be due to a lack of scale relevance and/or sensitivity to the intervention mechanisms indicated in the qualitative data. Conclusions: Digital mental health literacy applications are potentially an acceptable and feasible way to prevent burdens of common mental health problems amongst CYP in Indonesia. Our intervention and evaluative processes will be further refined prior to definitive evaluation. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Engaging adolescents in mental health education programs can markedly improve their knowledge, decrease stigma, and enhance professional help-seeking. Two-step study was carried out. The first step was applied to 416 secondary school students in two Egyptian Governorates, using an adapted version of a questionnaire used to survey beliefs and attitudes towards mental illness and professional help-seeking. The second step, a health education program, was implemented upon 224 students; they were classified into intervention and control groups. The program was done to improve their knowledge and attitude. Results: About 8% of participants had positive findings suggestive of mental illness; the commonest disorder was anxiety disorder (3.9%). Although most of the participants had a positive attitude towards a mentally ill person, 70.7% of them considered mentally ill persons dangerous, and 60.3% will be ashamed if they/their relatives have a mental illness. The main station of seeking help if having a mental trouble was friends (38.9%). The intervention succeeded to change the belief that mental illness is like any other illness from 46.4 to 96.4%. It decreased the belief that mental illness is an evil spirit from 38.4 to 6.3%. Attitude was improved after intervention for all items except in the point of marrying a person with mental illness. Help-seeking from family members or healthcare workers was significantly improved after the intervention. Conclusions: Anxiety was the commonest mental disorder among the studied group. Negative attitude and wrong beliefs can be changed with health education. Low professional help-seeking may arise the need for more effective professional interventions. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Young people are disproportionately affected by poor mental health. Youth sport settings hold immense potential to improve the mental health outcomes of this demographic. Efforts to leverage youth sport settings to promote mental health are limited by the lack of knowledge pertaining to engagement with mental health interventions in these settings. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the willingness of youth sporting club stakeholders (e.g., sportspersons, coaches, support staff, parents/guardians) to engage in mental health initiatives conducted by sporting clubs and ascertain possible determinants of engagement. Methods: This study used an observational cross-sectional design. Participants completed an online survey assessing likelihood of supporting a mental health campaign, mental health literacy (help-seeking, inclusive attitudes), and perceived club support. Perceptions pertaining to the importance of youth mental health and sporting clubs supporting youth mental health were also assessed. Results: The survey was completed by 275 stakeholders of youth sporting clubs in Australia (M<inf>age</inf> = 40.2 ± 15.8 years, 60.3% female). The findings indicated that stakeholders were willing to participate in mental health initiatives in youth sport clubs. A linear regression analysis indicated that the significant predictors of stakeholders supporting such initiatives were older age (> 25–50 and > 50 years; β = 0.15, p =.033, β = 0.19, p =.005, respectively), along with perceived importance of youth mental health (β = 0.24, p =.003) and sporting clubs supporting youth mental health (β = 0.22, p =.004). Conclusion: Youth sport settings have the capacity to improve the provision of mental health support among young people. There is a need for tailored approaches to enhance the engagement with, and effectiveness of, mental health resources in sport contexts. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Background Access describes factors that influence the initial contact or use of services, emphasising both the characteristics of patients and the health resources that influence the use of health services. Aims To compare Mexican boys and girls with mental disorders, with respect to primary diagnosis, symptom onset, and seeking and accessing specialised mental health services (SMHS). Method Longitudinal data were collected from primary caregiver-reported assessments of 397 child-caretaker dyads (child mean age 12.17 years, range 5-18 years, 63% male) that were obtained in two psychiatric hospitals specialising in child mental healthcare. Student t-tests and χ2-tests were applied to compare boys and girls regarding their diagnosis and variables associated with the seeking of and access to SMHS. Results Hyperkinetic disorder was the most prevalent diagnosis in boys, whereas depressive disorder and anxiety disorder were most prevalent in girls. The mean age at symptom onset for boys was 7 years, compared with 10 years for girls. Hyperkinetic disorder had the earliest symptom onset (mean 5.9 years), followed by depressive disorder (mean 9.8 years) and anxiety disorder (mean 12 years). Delayed access to SMHS was associated with initially seeking care from a psychologist, whereas quicker access was associated with affiliation with the (now defunct) Popular Insurance, a programme that served low-income and uninsured individuals. Conclusions Programmes aimed at children's mental health education and early intervention should consider gender- and diagnosis-related differences in symptom onset and trajectory. Access to SMHS might be improved by rapid identification by parents, educators, primary-care physicians and psychologists. © © The Author(s), 2023.

AB  - Purpose: Adolescence and young adulthood are recognised as critical time for developing mental health literacy (MHL). The purpose of this study is to analyse the effectiveness of current MHL interventions to guide the future development of MHL intervention strategies. Design/methodology/approach: A meta-analysis adopting the PRISMA framework for systematically reviewing the literature was adopted. Three authors independently reviewed studies and extrapolated key data for analysis. A robust random-effects model with adjustments for small study biases was conducted to establish the effect sizes of all included MHL interventions. Moderator analysis was conducted to examine the effects of intervention length in MHL. Findings: A total of 11 intervention studies were identified and analysed, resulting in a medium to large pooled effect size of 0.62 (95% CI: 0.28; 0.96). Moderator analysis found that short interventions had an estimated standard mean difference (SMD) effect size of 0.9220 (95% CI: −1.1555; 2.9995). This was greater than the medium length interventions, with an estimated SMD effect size of 0.4967 (95% CI: 0.0452; 0.9483), and long interventions, with an estimated SMD effect size of 0.5628 (95% CI: −0.2726; 1.3983). As a result, MHL interventions are proficient in improving young adults’ MHL, with shorter interventions (45–50 min) having the largest effect size. This study highlights several inconsistencies in methodological rigour and reporting from studies in this area, which future research should look to address. Originality/value: To date, MHL review studies have often focused their attention on a specific domain, most notably education and school-based setting. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no reviews have conducted a meta-analysis across contexts and domains with a specific focus on MHL intervention strategies for young adults. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Introduction: The implementation of nautical sports, particularly in coastal areas, during the school stage is a growing phenomenon. It offers unique opportunities for students to develop the necessary competencies outlined in their physical education curriculum in an immersive manner, within a natural and inherently motivating environment. Material and methods: This study aims to delve deeper into this subject by conducting a systematic review of the utilization of water sports in formal education. To carry out this bibliographic search, the following keywords were employed: “Nautical Activities”, “Nautical Sports”, “Nautical Camps”, “Formal Education”, “Children Education”, “Primary School”, and “Secondary School”. The Boolean operator “and” was used to combine these keywords during the search conducted in databases such as Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and SPORTDiscus. The PRISMA Protocol was utilized for the search process, resulting in the selection and categorization of eight papers into the following thematic areas: Wellbeing, Physical and Mental Health, Education, and Management. Results: The primary findings of this review indicate that the inclusion of these programs within physical education classes enhances overall physical health, mental well-being, and personal development. Conclusions: The results demonstrate a positive impact on peer interaction and short-term improvement in self-confidence. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: Studies have documented diverse adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on young people's lives—for instance on mental health, education/employment prospects, and intrafamily violence. We sought to generate much-needed evidence regarding whether, and which, young people are experiencing multiple intersecting effects. Methods: Data come from cross-sectional surveys with young people ages 15–25 years in Mexico (nationwide, n = 55,692), Kenya (four counties, n = 2,750), and India (two states, n = 3,537), collected from late 2020 to early 2022. We used latent class analysis to identify subgroups based on multiple adverse effects, then examined associations between these subgroups and COVID-19 infections/family deaths, and sociodemographic characteristics. Results: We found prevalent adverse impacts overall and two distinct subgroups in each country—one experiencing higher levels of all impacts, such as on mental health (44%–78% across countries), education/employment (22%–84%), intrafamily violence (22%–49%), and friendships (66%–86%). This subgroup comprised 40% of the sample in Mexico, 25% in Kenya, and 35% in India. In multivariate analyses, this group consistently had greater odds of experiencing COVID-19-related infections and deaths of loved ones. They were more likely socioeconomically disadvantaged, older, urban residents. Associations with other characteristics were country-specific. Discussion: This study provides novel cross-country evidence that a subgroup of young people has experienced intersecting adverse impacts of COVID-19 on their lives. Findings also confirm prior evidence of multiple elevated vulnerabilities in general. Expanded provision of multiple layers of support is required, particularly for the most vulnerable subgroup, as are multi-sectoral policies and interventions to prevent intersectional effects in future times of crisis. © 2023 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine

AB  - BACKGROUND: teen Mental Health First Aid (tMHFA) is an Australian school-based universal program for grade 10 to 12 students. tMHFA teaches teens how to recognize and respond to a peer in crisis or experiencing mental health concerns. METHODS: Schools implementing tMHFA in 2019 and 2020 were propensity score matched, yielding a sample of instructors (n = 130) and students (n = 1915) in 44 high schools in 24 American states. Effectiveness and acceptability were assessed with student surveys at baseline and after implementation. RESULTS: There were significant findings for primary outcomes, including improved helpful first aid intentions (Cohen ds = 0.57 to 0.58), confidence supporting a peer (ds = 0.19 to 0.31); the number of adults rated as helpful (ds = 0.37 to 0.44); and reductions in stigmatizing beliefs (ds = 0.21 to 0.40) and “harmful first aid intentions” (ds = 0.11 to 0.42). Instructors and students rated the program favorably with students sharing improvements on their recognition and responses to mental health problems and crises. CONCLUSION: tMHFA is an effective, feasible, and scalable training program for increasing mental health literacy and decreasing mental health stigma in adolescents in the short term, consistent with trials of tMHFA in Australian adolescents. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Pharmacists need knowledge and confidence to support people living with mental illness. Evidence-based educational materials for pharmacy students to provide psychosis care is limited. Aim: To co-design, content validate and pilot-test, with mental health stakeholders, simulated patient scenarios to educate and assess students in providing psychosis care. Method: Mental health consumers were invited to co-design three simulated patient scenarios (first-episode psychosis, carer of someone living with schizophrenia, non-adherence to antipsychotics), guided by published and psychometrically-tested materials. A panel of mental health stakeholders participated in two rounds of content validation (RAND/UCLA appropriateness model). Round 1 involved individual survey completion to calculate item content validity index (I-CVI) for relevance/clarity, content validity ratio for essentiality and overall scale content validity index (S-CVI/Ave and S-CVI/UA) scores for each scenario. Scores analyses and feedback comments informed revisions. Round 2 involved a panel meeting to discuss revisions and finalise content. The scenarios were then pilot-tested with pharmacy students. Results: Two consumers participated in co-design, nine stakeholders in content validation. All items showed excellent content validity for relevance/clarity. Eleven items were revised for essentiality, discussed, then re-rated at the panel meeting for consensus. The scenarios were pilot-tested with pharmacy students (n = 15) and reported to be realistic and relevant to future practice, contributing to students’ confidence in supporting people experiencing mental health symptoms or crises. Conclusion: Partnering with mental health stakeholders has enabled co-design of authentic, content valid educational materials for pharmacy students to provide psychosis care, in preparation for future provision of mental health support. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Mental health difficulties in the preschool years require early intervention, but preschool children are underserved in mental healthcare. One explanation might be that parents do not seek services because their problem recognition, or labeling, ability is lacking. While previous research demonstrates that labeling is positively associated with help-seeking, interventions aimed at improving help-seeking by improving labeling are not always successful. Parental perceptions of severity, impairment, and stress also predict help-seeking, but have not been examined alongside labeling. Thus, it is unclear how much they add to the parental help-seeking process. The present study simultaneously examined labeling and parental perceptions of severity, impairment, and stress on help-seeking. Participants (82 adult mothers of children ages 3–5 years) read vignettes describing preschool-aged children with symptoms of depression, anxiety, and ADHD, and answered a series of questions to assess their labeling and likelihood of help-seeking for each of the problems presented. Help-seeking was found to be positively associated with labeling (r =.73; r =.60), severity (r =.66), impairment (r =.31), and stress (r =.25). Furthermore, severity, impairment, and stress predicted endorsements of help-seeking above and beyond what was predicted by labeling alone (R2 change =.12; χ2 (3) = 20.03, p <.01). These results underscore the importance of parental perceptions of children’s behavior to the help-seeking process. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Purpose of Review: The aim of this review is to interpret the existing evidence regarding the psychological aspects of sport specialization within the context of a developmental framework. Recent Findings: The growing trend toward early sport specialization is associated with increased risk for injury and burnout, both of which have significant implications for mental health. Mental health literacy programs designed to promote awareness, decrease stigma, and encourage help-seeking behaviors can be an effective way to increase resilience and early recognition of those in need. Summary: The trend toward early sport specialization is likely motivated in large part by the expectation that it will increase the likelihood of long-term athletic success. However, recent studies suggest that the majority of elite athletes delay specialization at least until mid to late adolescence. It is essential to consider the developmental psychology of children and adolescents and to avoid imposing expectations that are beyond their neurocognitive capabilities. In addition to depression, anxiety, and burnout, young athletes who are pressured to perform to excessively high standards are likely to internalize athletic failures as feelings of shame. This can lead to maladaptive perfectionistic traits and potentially overtraining, clinical eating disorders, or other harmful behaviors that will result in declines in performance, physical health, and overall wellbeing. Further work is needed to better inform sport-specific recommendations regarding sport specialization and to optimize the beneficial effects of sport participation while limiting the risks of harm. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Mental illness, such as depression, anxiety disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and different addictive diseases, has increased among young adults over the last decade. Mental illness is associated with distress and problems functioning in social activities. Healthcare centres, that is, primary care, serve as the first point of contact with healthcare professionals for those young adults and provide outpatient medical and nursing care covering both physical and mental illness. Objective: To explore experiences of primary care among young adults with mental illness. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted that followed the method of Bettany–Saltikov and McSherry. A keyword search was performed in various databases, and after a quality assessment 23 articles were included in the review. Results: Young adults' experiences from primary care are described in four categories – Facing difficulties to accept help, relational preconditions, structural and organisational hindrances and satisfaction with youth-focused mental health interventions. Young adults with mental illness experience many difficulties in accessing and receiving proper help from primary care. Further, they did not believe in recovery from mental illness, and they also expressed a lack of mental health literacy. Conclusion: While being the first contact with healthcare professionals, primary care needs to adjust its services to address the growing group of young adults suffering from mental illness. It is necessary to provide tailored guidelines and interventions in primary care for young adults with mental illness, and the Tidal Model may improve the contacts with young adults in primary care. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Background: The majority of long-term mental health problems begin during adolescence. Low mental health literacy (MHL) may impede help-seeking for these problems. Although MHL is a multidimensional construct and adolescent help-seeking can be through formal and informal means, little is known about how dimensions of MHL influence these help-seeking intentions. This study examines associations between dimensions of MHL and formal and informal help-seeking intentions among adolescents. It also investigates whether informal help-seeking mediates the association between dimensions of MHL and formal help-seeking, and whether these associations are moderated by gender. Methods: A cross-sectional survey including measures of MHL, and help-seeking intentions was distributed to participants in 10 schools (12–17 years) across Scotland (n = 734). Data were analysed using Confirmatory Factor Analyses (CFA) and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). Results: Confirmatory Factor Analyses identified two distinct dimensions of MHL: ability to identify a mental health problem, and knowledge of treatment efficacy. Only knowledge of treatment efficacy was associated with increased intention to seek formal and informal help. Ability to identify a mental health problem was negatively associated with both forms of help-seeking intentions. Informal help-seeking mediated the association between both forms of MHL and formal help-seeking. Gender did not moderate the associations between MHL and help-seeking. Conclusions: Care should be taken when providing MHL interventions to ensure that adaptive forms of MHL are promoted. Future research should investigate possible mechanisms by which discrete forms of MHL influence adolescent help-seeking as well as investigating other potential moderators of MHL and help-seeking, such as stigma. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Background: School-based mental health literacy interventions aim to prevent mental disorders and promote mental wellbeing through improving the knowledge and understanding of mental health, mental disorders, and reducing stigma. Evidence suggests that good mental health literacy helps young people recognise mental health difficulties in themselves and in others, and seek help for mental health problems. Improved help-seeking can allow for early intervention, which prevents the progression of mental disorders and ultimately reduces the burden of mental disorders. The aim of this review is to identify and synthesise evidence on the effectiveness of school-based mental health literacy interventions in improving help-seeking outcomes. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, ERIC, Child Development and Adolescent Studies, British Education Index and ASSIA (June 2020). Additional searches were conducted a year later to identify any new publications (June 2021). We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of school-based interventions to improve help-seeking outcomes for children and young people aged 4–18 years. Included studies were critically appraised. Results: We identified 11 studies investigating help-seeking outcomes of school-based mental health literacy interventions including a total of 7066 participants from 66 secondary schools. Overall, there is no strong evidence for the effectiveness of school-based mental health literacy interventions in improving help-seeking outcomes, including general attitudes towards help-seeking, personal intentions to seek help, knowledge of when and how to seek help for mental disorders, confidence to seek help, and actual help-seeking behaviours. None of the studies investigated the cost-effectiveness of the interventions. Conclusion: The lack of standardised measures with established reliability and validity for help-seeking outcomes, and the incomprehensive consideration of the multi-faceted concepts of MH literacy and MH stigma have contributed to the scarcity of evidence for the effectiveness. Future research should focus on developing standardised measurement tools and including economic evaluations to understand pragmatic and financial aspects of school-based mental health literacy interventions. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - What is known on the subject?: The mental health needs of individuals are increasing following the COVID-19 pandemic, with a need to focus on the education of nurses to be equipped to respond. Stigma around mental health still exists for nursing students, with the implementation of mental health education by an individual with lived experience having a known positive effect on stigmatizing attitudes. Research on consumer involvement in nursing education identifies that the consumer role is often varied and casual, with no existing review on the consumer experience. What the paper adds to existing knowledge?: The study emphasizes the importance of consumer involvement in nursing education. Alongside the literature focussing on the student benefits, this review highlights both the benefits of being an educator, and the challenges of being an educator from the consumer's perspective. What are the implications for practice: The knowledge around the consumer perspective mapped in this review has the potential to impact and transform education protocols for consumer involvement in education. This can maximize on the meaningful contribution that lived experience has within mental health nursing education. This review enforces the need for an awareness of the challenges consumers face in their role as an educator, and highlights the need for further understanding of how to overcome these challenges. There is also an opportunity to capitalize on the benefits identified by consumers in their role within nursing education and sharing their lived experience. Abstract: Introduction While the mental health needs of populations are increasing, the targeted training of mental health professionals, specifically nurses, is required. Stigma surrounding mental health from nursing students exists, highlighting educational gaps. To address this, the involvement of consumers in undergraduate education has resulted in a positive effect on the stigmatizing attitudes of nursing students. There is still a limited understanding, however, of the consumers experience in this process. Aim To explore the experiences of individuals living with mental illness in educating nursing students. Methods The Joanna Brigg's Institute's (JBI) methodology for scoping reviews was used to search CINAHL, Medline, PsychInfo, Web of Science and Scopus including grey literature. The eligibility criteria for participants included individuals (a) diagnosed with a mental illness; (b) over 18 years of age; and (c) who participated in the educating of nursing students surrounding mental health in any context. Articles were only considered that were in the English language, and no time constraint was enforced during the search strategy for article selection. The search yielded 2640 results, of which 26 articles were included. Results Results found two prominent categories, including both benefits and challenges of being the educator from the consumer perspective. The benefits included: (a) the person behind the diagnosis; (b) reciprocal relationships; (c) positive effects on well-being; (d) unique contribution; and (e) purpose in storytelling. Challenges identified included: (a) vulnerability; (b) voyeuristic; (c) lack of preparation; (d) negative effects on well-being; (e) support; (f) not a real consumer; (g) variation of involvement; and (h) acknowledging consumer perspective. Discussion As consumer-led education for mental health nursing curriculum becomes mandated, amplifying the voice of the consumer in nursing education is crucial. While the benefits and challenges voiced by consumers in their involvement in mental health nursing education have been outlined here, further knowledge focussed on the consumer's experience as an educator outside the classroom setting, and in clinical practicum, alongside consumer involvement in specialized mental health education sessions, could aid in transforming consumer involvement. Implications for practice This review offers an incentive for nurse educators to capitalize on the benefits of educating for consumers to promote a meaningful contribution, while also practicing with an awareness of voiced challenges. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Aim: This study evaluated an online mental health literacy intervention to improve help-seeking for psychosis amongst parents of adolescents. Methods: A total of 2496 parents of first-grade junior high school students, recruited from a Japan-based survey company, participated in a randomized controlled trial in July 2016; participants were randomly allocated to the intervention (n = 1248) or control group (n = 1248). They were assessed at baseline and one-week post intervention. The intervention group received a 30-minute online educational programme that included a narrative of the mother of an adolescent with psychosis. Results: There were no between-group differences in changes in the rate of ‘no help-seeking’ in any hypothetical situations of a child's psychosis and prodromal symptoms. Conclusions: The intervention might have been suboptimal to improve mental health literacy for psychosis amongst parents of adolescents. A narrative message from a service user may be helpful to encourage parents in help-seeking. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

AB  - Active Minds, a national non-profit, was created to combat suicide and mental health stigma among youth and young adults. Research has indicated that Active Minds has been effective in positively changing students’ attitudes and behaviors towards mental health. This study seeks to understand what else Active Minds can do to address mental health barriers and help-seeking within student populations and how Active Minds can better support at-risk populations in their wellness. This study consisted of four focus groups, and 13 participants completed a Brief Questionnaire and answered open-ended questions from a semi-structured interview guide. The narrative was coded and categorized, and thematic analysis was utilized. Eight themes were identified: (a) creating shared safe spaces (b) mental health stigma among Native American and Hispanic/Latinx students (c) the vulnerability of LGBTQ + student populations (d) addressing special populations in Active Minds programming (e) the role of gender and religion in mental health (f) cultural education and resources (g) normalizing mental health through education and family conversation, and (h) promotion of Active Minds and accessibility of counseling. Because the sample size only consisted of 13 participants the results cannot be generalized to students, but the results are transferable to student populations. The researchers recommend that Active Minds use a peer support model and develop curriculums that address mental health stigma and cultural education in diverse populations. Future research is needed to uncover those strategies that might engage males in mental health education. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study explores the perspective of key informants (educators, preceptors and former students) of the Kintampo Project, on the perceived effectiveness, gains and challenges in delivering this large-scale training innovation in Ghana. The problem of mental health care neglect in Ghana is gradually improving. The Kintampo Project which trained mental health workers in Ghana has played a critical role in increasing access to mental health care. Design/methodology/approach: This qualitative study explored participants' perspectives on the Kintampo Project in three broad areas: perceived effectiveness, gains and challenges. In all, 17 interviews were conducted with former students, preceptors and educators from the project. The interviews were digitally audio-recorded, transcribed, coded and analysed using deductive and thematic methods. Findings: The participants perceived the project to have been successful in increasing the number of mental health workers in Ghana. The project provided a route for career progression for those involved. However, the Kintampo Project faced accreditation issues, low recognition, improper integration and remuneration of trained staff in the Ghana Health Service. This study points to the fact that the sustainability of mental health training in Ghana can be obstructed, because of this career path being less attractive. Further research is needed to explore how best to achieve sustainability of similar mental health innovations. Originality/value: This paper shares the views of participants in the Kintampo Project. © 2023, Mary Pomaa Agyekum, Selase Adjoa Odopey, Sabina Asiamah, Lucy Wallis, John E.O.

AB  - Background Immigrant students face various challenges in high-income countries that can contribute to the decline of their mental well-being upon arrival in their host country. Despite the growing population of these students in several high-income countries, there is inadequate attention given to their mental health needs and their access to mental health services. Thus, this systematic scoping review aimed to identify gaps in existing research relating to the barriers and facilitators associated with access to and use of mental health services in high-income countries. Methods Following the PRISMA-ScR checklist as guidance we systematically searched Ovid Med-line, APA PsycInfo, Education Source, CINAHL, Web of Science databases for peer reviewed articles related to barriers and facilitators of mental health service use among immigrant students. We conducted a narrative evidence synthesis to highlight barriers and facilitators to the use of mental health services. Results Out of the 2407 articles initially found, 47 studies met the inclusion criteria and were considered for this review. The increasing attention towards the mental health concerns of immigrant students and their access to mental health services is evident. However, various barriers like stigma, insufficient knowledge, or adherence to traditional gender roles (such as masculinity) hinder their utilization of these services. On the other hand, factors such as being a woman, having a strong sense of cultural adaptation, or possessing adequate mental health literacy serve as facilitators for accessing mental health services. Conclusion These students have unique experiences, and their needs are often unmet. To improve their mental health and use of mental health services, it is important to consider the barriers they face and their unique experience in their specific life context and to develop tailored prevention and intervention programs. © 2023 Dombou et al.

AB  - Reporting on trauma is part of the journalists’ job, and it needs to be conducted with care for their mental health of the interviewees and audiences. Data from focus groups and online survey with journalism students in Macedonia identified that: reporting on traumatic events can affect mental health; education can be a factor for coping and building resilience; educators lack adequate training; there are no adequate teaching materials in journalism courses at faculties; and at the end, students are not equipped with strategies and skills for dealing with trauma when reporting on trauma. © AEJMC 2023.

AB  - Although improving the mental health of children and adolescents has become a global priority, resources outlining developmentally appropriate content for improving mental health literacy (MHL) across school-aged children are scarce. A comprehensive, life-course approach to building MHL is needed to address the evolving competencies, needs, capacities, and risk factors for mental health, especially to establish school-based interventions that can be equitably and sustainably implemented. We conducted a theoretical review highlighting the relation of research and practice in building MHL through developmentally appropriate knowledge and competencies for children and adolescents. A two-pronged review of the literature was conducted to provide an overview of (1) research with a focus on neurobiological, psychological, cognitive, and social developmental milestones of school-aged children relevant for building MHL and (2) evidence-based and theory-driven content for the development of universal MHL interventions for children and adolescents considering the four components of MHL. A map of relevant key milestones highlights the range of development that occurs and ample opportunity for increasing universal MHL during these sensitive years primed for learning. We reflect on current understandings and global considerations for MHL interventions with an emphasis on applying developmental science to the future strengthening of intervention development, uptake, adaptation, implementation, evaluation, and scale-up. © The Author(s), 2023.

AB  - In recent times, global crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and geopolitical conflicts have significantly impacted pupils’ mental health. This opinion article presents evidence-based recommendations to bolster mental health support within educational systems, aiming to alleviate the psychological burden faced by students during these challenging times. This article argues that a proactive, holistic approach to mental health is essential for building a resilient educational infrastructure. More than ever, we support the call for the integration of mental health education into the core curriculum, equipping students with vital coping skills and fostering emotional intelligence. Additionally, we emphasize the importance of training educators and staff to identify and address mental health issues. Furthermore, this article highlights the need for interdisciplinary collaboration involving general practitioners, mental health professionals, community organizations, and policymakers in crafting and implementing support strategies. Educational institutions can effectively leverage the expertise of diverse stakeholders to create targeted interventions by cultivating partnerships. Finally, the significance of continuously evaluating and refining mental health support policies to ensure their efficacy and adaptability in the face of evolving crises is emphasized. Through these comprehensive recommendations, this opinion article seeks to catalyze a transformation in educational policies, prioritize mental health support, and empower pupils to thrive during tumultuous times. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Many mental health problems begin in adolescence and occur on a spectrum of severity: early recognition and intervention is important. This study is a quantitative feasibility study of the Mental Health Foundation’s Peer Education Project (PEP). Attrition, psychometric properties of questionnaires, indications of improvement on a range of outcomes, and sample size required for a powered trial of effectiveness were assessed. 203 students completed the survey both pre and post-intervention. It was found that existing previously-validated measures had good psychometric properties, with two new questionnaires demonstrating reasonable reliability (self-help confidence alpha = 0.78, mental health knowledge alpha = 0.59). There were indications of improvement in help-seeking intentions, the number of sources likely to seek help from, and mental health knowledge from pre- to post-intervention. A future trial of PEP with a sample of approximately 36 schools, researcher-led data collections, and help-seeking intentions or sources as a primary outcome appears to be feasible. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: The steadily increasing prevalence of mental disorders in children and adolescents presents itself as a public health challenge, especially given the health, social and economic burden of mental disorders. School-based interventions aimed at improving mental health literacy and reducing mental health stigma have the potential to prevent mental disorders and promote mental well-being, thus reducing the burden of mental disorders. This review identified and synthesised evidence on the effectiveness of school-based interventions designed to improve mental health literacy and reduce mental health stigma. Methods: Electronic bibliographic databases including MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), Child Development and Adolescent Studies, British Education Index and Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA) were searched. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included if they assessed the effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of school-based intervention aimed at improving mental health literacy and reducing mental health stigma for children and young people aged 4–18 years. Quality of studies was appraised using the EPHPP tool. A numerical summary and a narrative description of the findings in relation to the research questions were synthesised. This systematic review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020191265). Results: We identified 21 studies describing 20 unique school-based mental health interventions. Overall, there is moderate evidence suggesting that school-based mental health interventions can be effective in improving mental health literacy and reducing mental health stigma defined as attitudes and beliefs regarding mental disorders. However, there is less evidence for their long-term effectiveness, as most studies did not include follow-ups. Conclusions: Despite exclusively including studies with randomised designs, intervention and methodological heterogeneity poses uncertainties to any conclusions made. Future research should focus on resolving methodological issues concerning how outcomes are assessed and include process evaluations to better inform the design of an intervention in term of its delivery and implementation. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Schools are the most likely place for students to receive formal or informal mental health services and support. Classroom educators often provide informal mental health support to students and referrals to school-based services. Despite their key role, educators often feel underprepared in recognizing concerning symptoms in youth and supporting student mental health. This mixed-methods study explored the effectiveness of in-person Youth Mental Health First Aid (YMHFA) training on a diverse sample of 106 educators (M<inf>age</inf> = 22, SD = 1.9 years, 96% ethnic minorities): City Year AmeriCorps members who work in diverse low-income schools in Florida. We culturally adapted the program to better meet the needs of the participants and the students they serve as over 95% of the students they served were people of color. Quantitative survey data were collected at three time points (pre, post, and 3 months after the training) to examine whether YMHFA training better equipped classroom educators to support students’ mental health. Overall, training was associated with improvements in mental health literacy, knowledge of school-based mental health providers, confidence, and intentions to engage in mental health first aid (MHFA) behaviors. Notably, educators reported greater engagement in mental health first aid behaviors at the 3-month followup than before training. No improvement in mental health stigma was observed. Some improvements (i.e., mental health literacy, intentions to help) were not sustained at the follow-up. Qualitative data generally supported quantitative findings and suggested that the YMHFA program with cultural consideration is suitable for this diverse sample of classroom educators. Educators’ suggestions to improve the training to support culturally and linguistically diverse students’ mental health are discussed. © 2023 American Psychological Association

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic accelerated the impending youth mental health crisis in the United States, necessitating a comprehensive approach to providing mental health education and interventions. School-based occupational therapy practitioners’ scope of practice includes wellness promotion, early detection, and evidence-based interventions for mental health challenges. Given the rise of school-based wellness programs, the growing legislation supporting the formation of such programs, and the burgeoning burden of pediatric mental health concerns, occupational therapy practitioners are uniquely positioned to create and implement interventions to support student access to the general education curriculum and can do so by using both prepandemic funding sources and pandemic response funds. This Health Policy Perspectives column is a call to action to refocus the occupational therapy practitioner’s role in school settings to include providing high-quality, evidence-based preventive mental health education and interventions. In this column, we examine prevention-based occupational therapy services in Mason City Schools, Mason, Ohio, as a model of success in the execution of this vision for school-based practice. In addition, we outline the importance of expanding the role of occupational therapy practitioners in schools, which will in turn increase the visibility and relevancy of the profession and broaden its impact on mitigating the youth mental health crisis. © 2023 American Occupational Therapy Association, Inc.

AB  - Over the last years, there have been several studies that have shown insufficient levels of adolescents’ mental health literacy (MHL). Knowledge about intervention programs that promote positive mental health literacy (PMeHL) among adolescents is still very scarce. In this sense, we defined as objectives to identify and describe the necessary components to design a program proposal that promotes adolescents’ PMeHL. We conducted an exploratory, descriptive, qualitative study using two focus groups in July and September 2022 with an intentional non-probability sample of eleven participants (nine professional experts and two adolescents). Data were analyzed using content analysis, using NVivo® 12 software (version 12, QRS International: Daresbury Cheshire, UK). We obtained a total of four categories and eighteen subcategories: structure (context; format; contents; length and frequency; pedagogical methods; pedagogical techniques; resources; denomination), participants (target group; program facilitators), assessment (timing; evaluation instruments), other components (planning, articulation and adaptation; involvement; training; special situations; partnerships; referral). The perspectives of the professional experts and of the adolescents that we obtained from this study contributed to the design of a proposal for a program to promote adolescents’ PMeHL. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Background AU LGBTQ+: Pleaseconfirmthatallheadinglevelsarerepresentedcorrectly community’s higher susceptibility to worse mental:health outcomes and more help-seeking barriers compared to the cis-heterosexual population. Despite the LGBTQ+ population facing higher mental health risks, there has been a dearth of research focusing on developing tailored interventions targeting them. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of a digital multicomponent intervention in promoting help-seeking for mental health issues in LGBTQ+ young adults. Methods and findings We recruited LGBTQ+ young adults aged between 18 and 29 who scored moderate or above on at least 1 dimension of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21 and did not have help-seeking experiences in the past 12 months. Participants (n = 144) were stratified by gender assigned at birth (male/female) and randomly allocated (1:1 ratio) to the intervention or active control parallel condition by generating a random number table, so they were blinded to the intervention condition. All participants received online psychoeducational videos, online facilitator-led group discussions, and electronic brochures in December 2021 and January 2022, with the final follow-up in April 2022. The contents of the video, discussion, and brochure are help-seeking for the intervention group and general mental health The current intervention was an effective approach in promoting help-seeking intentions, mental health literacy, and help-seeking encouragement-related knowledge. Its brief yet integrated intervention format could also be utilized in treating other imminent concerns confronted by LGBTQ+ young adults. © 2023 Public Library of Science. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Mental health problems, such as behavioural and emotional problems, are prevalent in children. These problems can have long lasting, detrimental effects on the child, their parents and society. Most children with a mental health problem do not receive professional help. Those that do get help can face long wait times. While waiting, parents want to learn how they can help their child. To address this need, we co-designed a new website to help parents find ways of helping their child’s mental health problem while waiting to get specialist help. Objectives To assess the acceptability and feasibility of a new co-designed website, FindWays, through a pilot randomised controlled trial. The protocol is registered with ISRCTN (ISRCTN64605513). Methods This study will recruit up to 60 parents of children aged two-twelve years old referred to a paediatrician for behavioural and/or emotional problems. Participants will be randomly allocated by computer generated number sequence to either the intervention or control group. Intervention group participants will receive access to the FindWays website to help them manage their child’s mental health problem while they wait to see the paediatrician. Acceptability and feasibility will be assessed over the 4-month intervention through mixed methods including: recruitment, adherence, retention, net promoter score (quantitative measures) and semi-structured interviews to gain an in-depth understanding of parents’ experience and potential adverse effects (qualitative measure). Secondary outcomes measured by parent survey at 4-months post randomisation include child mental health, parent mental health, impact of the child’s mental health problem on their functioning and family, and health service use and associated costs. Results Recruitment commenced June 2022 with publication expected in October 2023. Conclusion This study will provide novel data on the acceptability and feasibility of a new website co-designed with parents to help them find ways of managing their child’s behaviour and emotions. © 2023 Peyton et al.

AB  - Psychiatric illness and stigma are serious global concerns. Adolescents with psychiatric illness represent a vulnerable group. The purpose for this study was to explore the associations of attitudes toward people with mental illness, mental health literacy and clinical characteristics captured while adolescent patients were hospitalized with the patients’ perceived stigma encountered post-discharge. Psychiatrist-reported less improvement in functioning was associated with perceived personal rejection, and patient-reported severity of symptoms was associated with perceived secrecy. Inpatients who do not display good improvement in functioning while in hospital may benefit from specialized intervention such as cognitive behavioural therapy during and after their hospital stay. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Community sports coaches and leaders can have an important role to play as informal resources for sporting adolescents and adults at risk of mental ill-health. Supporting coach mental health literacy using programs has potential to enhance opportunities for coach-player support. This study aimed to evaluate a community sport mental health literacy program and its capacity to improve club leader confidence to support and refer (primary outcome), awareness of resources, beliefs about mental health and stigmatizing attitudes (social distance). A cluster-randomized controlled evaluation was conducted with measures taken at baseline (around 2 weeks prior to intervention), immediately post-program and at a nine-month follow up. Twenty-five community Australian Rules Football clubs from metropolitan and regional centres were sampled and matched by size and location. Coaches or sport leaders (n = 265) were randomized by club to either the intervention group or a waitlist control group. A multivariate analysis of variance (pre-test scores as covariates) revealed participants in the ‘Tackle Your Feelings’ (TYF) program reported improved outcomes compared to controls on measures tied to leader confidence to support and refer, knowledge of resources to support mental health, general help-seeking and stigmatizing attitudes tied to social distance. A fifth measure of beliefs about mental illness was not impacted by the program. A nine-month comparison group follow-up indicated some decay in scores over time. The results suggest that TYF programs can be effective at improving coach mental health literacy in community sporting club contexts. © 2023

AB  - Background: Adolescent mental health is a major public health issue. It is important to educate adolescents and their families about mental illnesses. However, very little attention has been paid to mental health literacy among individuals, particularly among adolescents. Purpose: The aim of this study is to assess depression and depression literacy levels, as well as their correlations among a sample of school students. Methods: Anonymous self-report questionnaires were used to conduct a cross-sectional study. This was to gather data from three public schools in the northern region of Jordan. Results: The study sample included a total of 225 participants, with 55.6% being female and the mean age being 15.09 (SD = 1.89). About 45% of these students were found to have depression symptoms and 27.6% of them had moderate and severe levels of depression. The participants were also found to have very low levels of depression literacy. A significant positive correlation was found between depression symptoms and depression literacy. The predictors of depression symptoms were gender, grade point average and monthly family income. The predictors of depression literacy were fathers’ educational level, physical exercise and family history of mental health problems. Conclusion: The findings highlight the urgent need for improving knowledge about mental illness among adolescents. Further research and strong support are highly recommended, specifically regarding issues that affect adolescents’ mental health. Implications for Nursing: The discussion covers several intervention implications and suggestions aiming to maintain adolescents’ psychological well-being. For example, nursing leaders should develop and implement programs for assessing depression, providing counselling and enhancing mental health literacy among adolescent school students. © 2023, Jordan University of Science and Technology.

AB  - Purpose: There has been growing awareness underpinned with legislative recognition of the need to reduce the stigma attached to mental health. Education is seen as an integral factor for this endeavour. The purpose of this paper is to review existing literature to determine both positive and negative attitudinal changes of health-care-related undergraduate students towards mental illness after a training intervention within higher education. Design/methodology/approach: A search of papers written in the English Language was conducted between 2004 and 2021, using CINAHL, Eric, Educational Research Complete, Medline, psychINFO and SocIndex. Search terms used were undergraduate, attitudes or perceptions, mental illness/mental ill health, education, stigma and students. Findings: In total, 24 studies were critically reviewed, which included experimental, descriptive and exploratory designs. The appraisal of papers used recognised evaluation tools to review the methodological quality. Findings suggest that overall, anti-stigma education has a significant positive effect for student attitudinal change. Research limitations/implications: Mental health anti-stigma education is beneficial for changing attitudes, however, more bio-medically framed training is less powerful for initiating change. Learning from those with the lived experience appears to have a more sustainable impact as indicated in some of the studies. There is a need for more exploratory research to gain further knowledge on the critical educational mechanisms that may foster more long-term reframing of positive attitudes towards mental health. Practical implications: Training providers need to consider the compelling evidence base surrounding anti-stigma pedagogy that supports the use of individuals with experience of mental ill health within the educational processes. Social implications: Mental health stigma has potential for profound negative impact on individuals and at a wider societal level. Education is central to enable learners to consider their attitudes to mental illness to reduce stigmatising attitudes. Students on health-care-related courses are influential in becoming catalysts for change. Originality/value: This paper has critically reviewed the literature examining the attitudes of health-care-related undergraduate students following anti-stigma education, offering insights into some of positive and negative attitudinal changes and opinions of the event. In particular contributing to an understanding on the important components for eradicating the stigma surrounding mental health. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The landscape of Extended Reality (ER), which includes Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR) is rapidly changing. However, despite the promising results from many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) developed on healthcare environments, there is a lack of standardization, specifically to determine their effectiveness in academic settings. To our best knowledge, this is the first systematic review addressing the efficacy of MR to enhance learning and skills acquisition in undergraduate mental health education. The purposes of this study were to review the scientific literature of those studies involving MR and undergraduate mental health education, to answer the two following questions: (1) Is MR useful to enhance the acquisition of knowledge and skill training in undergraduate mental health education, and (2) Which are the advantages and disadvantages that should be addressed to successfully develop MR in undergraduate mental health education? We conducted a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature from EBSCO, Ovid, PubMed, and Scopus y WOS (Web of Science), following the PRISMA statements and using “mixed reality + education”, “mixed reality + student”, “mixed reality + undergraduate”, and “mixed reality + mental health”, as keywords. Those studies published between 2012 to present, in English or Spanish language, were reviewed. A total of 2608 records were retrieved, and only 6 publications met the inclusion criteria, and were finally included. MR training used was varied. There were no studies providing specific outcomes regarding the student’s acquired knowledge (theoretical concepts) after using MR. Several strengths and weaknesses of using MR with students were discussed. The results will be useful to develop innovative MR strategies to improve undergraduate mental health education, due to the lack of studies focused on this topic. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Friendships are crucial in adolescent development. This paper presents a scoping review, followed by a systematic review, to assess friendship interventions and their impacts on the mental health outcomes of adolescents aged 12–24 years. Studies were included if they incorporated a friend or authentic social group in an intervention dedicated to improving mental health outcomes and well-being. Twenty-four studies were included in the scoping review, and eighteen in the systematic review. Data from 12,815 adolescents were analysed; three prominent themes emerged. The most common theme was promoting mental health literacy, followed by supporting help-seeking, and friendship-building/combating isolation. Most evaluations focused on the individual who had received the intervention, rather than their wider friends who would have been potential contacts and experienced any altered interactions. Of the studies focusing on friendship-building, all had positive short-term outcomes but inconclusive long-term effects. Two studies recruited friends from an individual’s authentic social group. While opportunities for improving mental health literacy and help-seeking emerged as key themes, the role of friends in mental health interventions has only been included in a small number of studies. Given that friends are a key point of contact for many adolescents, a better understanding of their domains of influence, particularly on mental health, will potentially enhance interventions. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Psychoeducation is recommended in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia and has been shown to improve satisfaction with mental health service and treatment adherence, reduce relapse and hospital readmission rates, and enhance functioning and quality of life. Youth at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR) may also benefit from receiving psychoeducation as part of their treatment. The goal of this study was to conduct a scoping review to map out the existing literature on psychoeducation for CHR individuals, including content, utilization, and benefits, in order to identify areas for future research and clinical care. Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic search of electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection) to identify literature through 02/25/2022 that provided data or significant commentary about the provision of psychoeducation to CHR individuals. After screening titles and abstracts, four co-authors assessed full-text articles for eligibility. Thirty-three studies were included in the review. Psychoeducation is recommended in the treatment of CHR individuals, is a preferred treatment option among CHR individuals, and many CHR programs report offering psychoeducation. However, details about the psychoeducational content and method of delivery are notably absent from recommendations and reports on the provision of CHR psychoeducation in real-world settings. We identified two brief and structured CHR psychoeducation interventions and one longer-term psychoeducational multifamily group model for CHR that show feasibility and promise, though they have not yet undergone randomized trials to evaluate effectiveness of the psychoeducation. We also identified several comprehensive CHR interventions that included an explicit psychoeducation module, though the unique role of the psychoeducational component is unknown. Despite being recommended as a critical component of treatment for CHR individuals and preferred by CHR individuals, the ways in which psychoeducation are being delivered to CHR individuals in real-world practice is still largely ambiguous. Rigorous evaluations of psychoeducation treatment models are needed, as well as investment from clinical programs to facilitate the implementation and dissemination of standardized psychoeducation for CHR individuals. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this Clinical Update is to review the principles, structures, processes, and outcomes of collaborative mental health care in the pediatric primary care setting. Method: A search of the literature on this topic from 2001was conducted initially in 2016, yielding 2,279 English-language citations. These citations were supplemented by references suggested by topic experts and identified through Web searches, increasing the yield to 2,467 total citations, of which 1,962 were unduplicated. After sequential review by Update authors at title/abstract and then full-text levels, the citations were winnowed to 219 based on topic relevance. A follow-up search from 2016 was conducted in 2021, yielding 2 additional citations based on nonduplication from initial search and topic relevance. Results: The collaborative care approach, arising in the 1990s and gaining momentum in the 2000s, aims to extend behavioral health care to the primary care setting. The goal of collaborative care is to conserve the sparse specialty care workforce for severe and complex psychiatric disorders through shifting certain specialty mental health tasks (eg, assessment; patient self-management; brief psychosocial intervention; basic psychopharmacology; care coordination) to primary care. Collaborative care can be delivered on a spectrum ranging from coordinated to co-located to integrated care. Although each of these models has some empirical support, integrated care—a multidisciplinary team-based approach—has the strongest evidence base in improving clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction while constraining costs. Challenges to integrated care implementation include insufficient mental health education and insufficient specialist consultative and care coordination support for primary care practitioners; space, time, and reimbursement constraints in the primary care setting; discomfort among primary care practitioners in assuming mental health tasks previously undertaken by specialists; and continuing need for and unavailability of ongoing specialty mental health care for severe and complex cases. Essential supporting activities for effective collaborative care include patient and family engagement, professional education and training, evaluation/demonstration of impact, fiscal sustainability, and advocacy for model dissemination. Conclusion: Health professionals who are educated in the collaborative care approach can improve access to and quality of behavioral health care for children and adolescents with behavioral health needs. © 2022 American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry

AB  - Introduction: Resilience is considered of high relevance when developing interventions to cope with stressful situations. Schools are one of the key settings to promote resilience among adolescents. The purpose of this cluster randomized controlled trial is to assess the effectiveness of an intervention in adolescents at risk, aged 12-to-15 years old, to increase resilience and emotional regulation strategies. Methods: The recruitment period started in January 2022. Schools will be randomly allocated to control and intervention groups by an external researcher using computer-generated random numbers. The minimum sample size was estimated to be 70 participants per group. Primary health care nurses will carry out the intervention during the school period (January to June 2022). Students will follow a specific training consisting of six 55-min sessions, for 6 weeks. Each session will consist of 5 min of mindfulness, followed by 45 min of the corresponding activity: introducing resilience, self-esteem, emotional regulation strategies, social skills, problem-solving, community resources, social and peer support, and 5 min to explain the activity to do at home. Data will be collected at baseline, 6 weeks, and 24 weeks after the intervention. The child youth resilience measure-32 (CYRM-32) scale will be used to assess the effectiveness of the intervention. This study received a grant in June 2021. Discussion: The intervention is intended to improve mental health through resilience. Different factors related to resilience will be promoted, such as self-esteem, emotional regulation, social and communication skills, problem-solving and peer support, among others. As it has been designed as a cluster-randomized school-based intervention, we will directly ameliorate the participation and engagement of the target population. With the present intervention, we expect to improve coping skills in adolescents by enhancing resilience capacities. © © 2023 Llistosella, Torné, García-Ortiz, López-Hita, Ortiz, Herández-Montero, Guallart, Uña-Solbas and Miranda-Mendizabal.

AB  - Mental health literacy (MHL) helps improve mental health outcomes and reduce the impacts of mental illness. This study aims to reflect on scientific evidence on MHL levels, barriers to MHL, their impacts on mental health among Australian youth and interventions to overcome these barriers. The factors explored in the Perspective included; influence of social determinants, culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) communities, help-seeking attitudes and behaviors. MHL intervention programs and MHL for improving mental health outcomes due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic were also explored. Adequate levels of youth MHL significantly improved one's ability to recognize own mental health status as well as provide peer support. Practical considerations such as designing more gender and culturally specific youth MHL programs are proposed. © © 2023 Bennett, Allitt and Hanna.

AB  - Mental health education faces several challenges in a traditional format: how to share people's lived experience and adapt to students' new ways of learning? The stand up design of instruction (STUDI) aims to turn these challenges into benefits by engaging the student in a brief online video format. Stand-up comedy is a performance by a single actor, without props or set, that establishes an intimate relationship of familiarity with the audience and reveals social unspoken things about topics such as sex or money. Mental health is part of a common social experience that nevertheless remains taboo and stigmatized: the video standup format reveals it in an empathetic and explicit way: it exposes a mental health problem by starting from the experience. It is followed by exercises that include questions on objective and subjective understanding of the problem, acquisition of knowledge necessary to solve the problem, application of skills in analyzing the problem, and avenues for using the acquired skills in a real situation. The objective is to present a pilot experiment using this training model. The expected results are a better understanding of the experience of mental health problems, the acquisition of subjective and objective analysis skills, transdisciplinary access to training, de-stigmatization of mental health problems, increased attractiveness of mental health knowledge, and awareness of the psychological and social dimensions of health. © 2023 EMH Swiss Medical Publishers Ltd..

AB  - Aim and Objective: The purpose of this study is to examine the effects that dance interventions have on the somatic symptoms and psychological health of teenage girls and it also provides scientific guidance for mental health education in schools. Methodology: The participants in the research were female adolescents between the ages of 10 and 18 years old (mean years: 15.89±2.85). The criteria for inclusion were internalizing difficulties that were connected to stress, as well as several visits to the school nurse for both physical symptoms (such as headaches, stomachaches, weariness, and hurting shoulders) and emotional discomfort (e.g. persistent feelings of stress, nervousness, and anxiety). There were a total of one hundred teenage girls with stress-related internalizing disorders who participated in the research study. Of them, fifty were assigned at random to the dance intervention group, while the remaining fifty were assigned to the control group. Results: The majority of the females are between the ages of 14 and 16. Girls were present at a rate of 44% in the intervention group and 40% in the control group respectively. This was followed by a rate of 42% in the age group for 16–18 years old and 38% in the age group for 12–14 year olds. In the age group of 10–12 year olds, only 4% of girls were present. 78% of boys and 70% of girls engage in physical activity. For those participating in the dancing intervention and those serving as the control, respectively. At the beginning of the study, the total mean value for somatic symptoms was 3.25±1.25, and the mean value for emotional distress was 3.89±1.33. The emotional distress and somatic symptoms connection has a Pearson value of r=0.84, which indicates a strong relationship between the two. The levels of emotional distress before and after the intervention were as follows: stress 47 (94%) and 6 (12%), nervousness 45 (90%) and 5 (12%), anxiety 49 (98%) and 6 (12%), sadness 46 (92%) and 5 (12%), irritation 44 (88%) and 4 (8%), and powerlessness 47 (94%) and 4 (8%). Conclusion: According to the findings of the current research, dance therapies can alleviate stress-related physical symptoms as well as mental discomfort in teenage females. Nevertheless, the impact of the intervention was not sustained one year after the session had been completed, which suggests that participants need to continue frequent involvement in the intervention for the outcomes to be permanent. To assess the efficacy of the intervention in a variety of contexts, more randomized trials are necessary. © 2023 Journal of Natural Science, Biology and Medicine.

AB  - In order to use big data analysis and artificial intelligence technology for students, educational institutions and parents need to better understand the mental health status of students to support them and provide intervention measures. Thus, we designed an intelligent analysis platform for student mental health to evaluate and predict it by collecting and analyzing multi-dimensional data such as personal information, learning behavior data, and social media activities. By using models and algorithms, the platform identified possible mental health problems of students such as anxiety, depression, and stress, and provided timely warnings and suggestions. At the same time, the platform provided customized mental health support and intervention programs based on students' personalized needs and characteristics, including online psychological counseling, mental health education resources, and self-help tutoring tools to develop students' mental health and improve academic achievement. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Physiotherapists play an integral role in the management of people living with a mental illness, yet little is known about their knowledge, attitudes and perceptions about mental health globally and particularly in South Africa. Aim: The purpose of the study is to map global evidence on mental health education for physiotherapists, including their knowledge, attitude and perceptions, with the goal of using this information to design an improved undergraduate curriculum for physiotherapy in South Africa. Setting: The search was focused on the South African and global context, with the participants as physiotherapists and physiotherapy students. Methods: The methodical framework proposed by Arksey and O’Malleys guided the scoping review. The online search used five electronic databases. An expert librarian assisted in the search strategy. English language, primary research articles that investigated physiotherapist or physiotherapy students’ knowledge, attitude and perceptions towards mental health were sought. Results: The search strategy extracted 226 published studies and 15 studies were included in the analysis. The results indicated that globally physiotherapists and physiotherapy students had limited knowledge about mental health. Improved attitudes were noted with a mental health training intervention. Negative perceptions were associated with limited knowledge. Conclusion: There was limited literature on the influence of education on mental health in physiotherapy on attitudes and perceptions. Physiotherapists desired more knowledge about mental health because of the prevalence of mental health disorders. Contribution: Because of the increasing prevalence of mental illness globally, the findings of this review suggest the necessity of integrating mental health content in the physiotherapists’ undergraduate programme to provide high-quality care physiotherapy management for people with mental illnesses. © 2023.

AB  - In the post-epidemic era, the adoption of isolation measures, remote care, and remote learning and work has become the new norm. These significant changes and the accompanying stresses have led to a rise in psychological issues among individuals in modern society. Consequently, the objective of this study was to design an interactive e-book focused on mental health education. The research methodology employed involved referencing the immersive experience scale and conducting pre-test and post-test questionnaires to evaluate the participants’ experiential perceptions. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the impact of immersive experiences in interactive electronic picture books. Additionally, the feasibility of incorporating interactive electronic graphics into the realm of medical and health education was explored. This research highlights the significance of enhancing public awareness and understanding of depression among adolescents. The development of an interactive e-book has proven to be an effective tool for individuals to acquire knowledge about depression and cultivate empathy and support. The inclusion of interactive reading elements enhances the sense of immersion. Further research can delve into the broader implications of interactive e-books and similar interventions in the field of mental health education. The findings of this study also offer valuable insights into the application of interactive electronic graphics and digital tools in the context of medical and health education. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Background: Teenagers are more prone to mobile phone addiction than other age groups due to their lack of self-control. This addiction to mobile phones severely affects their physical and mental health, causing irreversible harm as they grow older. As such, exploring suitable psychotherapy for their physical and mental development needs is essential, in ways that effectively change teenagers’ mobile phone addictive behaviors. Methods: An experimental study was conducted on 910 teenage volunteers recruited from 5 communities in Gansu, Hebei, and Liaoning Provinces in China from May to July 2023. The participants were screened using the Mobile Phone Addiction Index Scale (MPAI). On the basis of the evaluation results, 56 individuals were selected based on the evaluation results and randomly divided into experimental and control groups, each comprising 28 individuals. The experimental group underwent an 8-week mindfulness-based mental health education therapy. Both groups were measured before and after the intervention. Results: The mobile phone addiction score of the experimental group was significantly lower than that of the control group (P<0.001). The cognitive tendency score and mental wellbeing score of the experimental group was significantly higher than those of the control group (P<0.001). Conclusion: Mindfulness-based mental health education therapy effectively alleviates teenagers’ mobile phone addiction and improves their cognitive tendencies and mental health. This approach serves as a valuable reference for effectively preventing and managing mobile phone addiction among teenagers. © 2023 Wang et al.

AB  - Children living in rural areas may potentially experience low levels of life satisfaction and face challenges in developing self-confidence. The purpose of the current study was to examine the impact of a mental health education intervention on the life satisfaction and self-confidence of children residing in rural areas of China. A total of 1,001 children from grades 4 to 6 were randomly assigned to an intervention group (475 children, 250 boys, M = 11.57 years, SD = 1.082 years) and a control group (526 children, 279 boys, M = 11.38 years, SD = 0.980 years). Over 16 weeks, the intervention group received a mental health education program, while the control group did not. The levels of life satisfaction (including five dimensions: family, school, environmental, friends, and self-satisfaction) and self-confidence (including three dimensions: self-efficacy, self-assurance, and self-competence) were rated by all children at baseline and post-intervention. Results from paired samples t-test showed that post-intervention, the intervention group exhibited significant improvements in the areas of family, environmental, school, and self-satisfaction as well as self-efficacy, self-assurance, and self-competence. However, there was no significant improvement in friend satisfaction. Conversely, the control group showed decreases in school, environmental, and friend satisfaction, along with decreases in self-efficacy, self-assurance, and self-competence. No significant change was observed in family and self-satisfaction in this group. These findings emphasize the importance of implementing mental health education interventions for rural children, who are at risk for low life satisfaction and self-confidence. Some specific recommendations are provided for policymakers and practitioners. © © 2023 Long, Wang, Wang, Yao and Liu.

AB  - Background: Healthcare students are a population more at risk for mental health issues, especially anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts. The health faculty of Université Paris Cité in France, Paris has implemented a Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) course aiming to improve students’ mental health literacy, self-care and peer-support and to decrease stigma about mental illness. We conducted a qualitative study exploring the lived experience of this MHFA training course among healthcare students so to better assess its implementation within this specific context and population. Methods: This qualitative study used the five-stage inductive process to analyze the structure of lived experience (IPSE) approach. All the healthcare students that had completed the 2-day MHFA training were approached to participate. Data was collected through individual semi-structured interviews and inclusion continued until data saturation was reached. Data analysis was based on an inductive, descriptive, and structuring procedure to determine the structure of lived experience characterized by the central axes of experience. Results: Twenty students were included. Data analysis produced a common structure of lived experience based on three central axes of experience, (1) a personal experience, (2) a student experience and (3) a professional experience. The participants all experienced this course intertwined within these 3 axes. Their motivation to take the course was personal -being of feeling concerned by the topic-, was study-oriented – to learn and revise psychiatry- and was professional – so to develop both practical and soft skills. In their personal experience, participants reported a transformative experience and some interventions with friends and family, while both in their student and professional experience, they felt frustrated with both the content and the form of the course. Conclusion: The results reported similar outcomes reported in the literature about skills, knowledge, and awareness; but mostly produce original avenues about how to better adapt such course to this specific population so to better address students’ expectations and mental health issues. This MHFA course -with an adapted content addressing eating disorders, self-mutilations and sexual and gender-based violence – could be part of the early curriculum of healthcare students. The latter could then benefit from a level 2/advanced MHFA course years later specifically tailored for healthcare professionals. © © 2023 Sibeoni, Ellul, Bubola, Debiche and Piot.

AB  - Context: Lack of education, stigma, and negative selfattitudes are key barriers to help-seeking in Gaelic footballers. With the prevalence of mental health issues in Gaelic footballers and the increased risk of experiencing mental health challenges after injury, mental health literacy (MHL) interventions are necessary. Objectives: To design and implement a novel MHL educational intervention program in Gaelic footballers. Design: Controlled laboratory study. Setting: Online. Patients or Other Participants: Elite and subelite Gaelic footballers divided into intervention (n = 70; age = 25.1 ± 4.5 years) and control (n = 75; age = 24.4 ± 6.0 years) groups. In the intervention group, 85 participants were recruited, but 15 dropped out after completing baseline measures. Interventions: A novel educational intervention program, "GAA [Gaelic Athletic Association] and Mental Health-Injury and a Healthy Mind," was designed to address the key components of MHL and was underpinned by the Theory of Planned Behavior and the Help-Seeking Model. The intervention was implemented online via a brief 25-minute presentation. Main Outcome Measures: Measures of stigma, help-seeking attitudes, and MHL were completed by the intervention group at baseline, immediately after viewing the MHL program, and at 1 week and 1 month after the intervention. The control group completed the measures at similar time points. Results: Stigma decreased, and attitudes toward helpseeking and MHL increased in the intervention group from baseline to after the intervention (P < .05), with significant differences sustained at 1-week and 1-month follow-ups. Our results showed differences in stigma, attitudes, and MHL between groups across time points. Intervention participants provided positive feedback, and the program was appraised as informative. Conclusions: Remote online delivery of a novel MHL educational program can effectively decrease mental health stigma, improve attitudes toward help-seeking, and increase the recognition and knowledge of mental health issues. Gaelic footballers with improved MHL may be better equipped to manage their mental health and cope with stressors, leading to improved mental health outcomes and overall mental well-being. © 2023 National Athletic Trainers' Association Inc..

AB  - Social media use is common in adolescents and carries with it particular advantages and disadvantages, which may not be immediately apparent. Social media, first and foremost, is a platform for communication, social connection, and self-expression. It can be a way for adolescents to explore their identity and is an important means of education. The negative aspects of social media are numerous and include cyberbullying, sexting, exposure to triggering content, and encouragement of high-risk behaviors. The topic of social comparison is central to understand when discussing the influence of social media on adolescents. Furthermore, issues of privacy on the internet are incredibly important. For clinicians, social media provides opportunities for mental health education and therapeutic intervention with adolescents. This chapter provides an explanation and review of these platforms. Recommendations for clinicians on how to identify risks and encourage positive use of social media among adolescents are included. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

AB  - Background: Because the majority of mental illnesses develop early in life, effective preventative public mental health interventions are needed. Interventions fostering mental health literacy can be used to enhance personal resources and capacities to facilitate mental health care and thus, address help-seeking barriers. A Canadian mental health literacy school curriculum was adapted, piloted, and evaluated for the use in German schools. The study presents the intervention’s effects on mental health knowledge and help-seeking efficacy among 10th grade students in Germany. Methods: 10th grade students (aged 14–17 years old) from one secondary school participated in a pre- and post-intervention control group study. Both groups completed a questionnaire at two time points assessing mental health knowledge and help-seeking efficacy. Repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to evaluate the intervention’s effects. Results: Data from 188 students was eligible for analysis. The analysis of the baseline data reveals a high comparability of the two groups in terms of demographics, and initial mental health knowledge and help-seeking efficacy scores. ANOVA results showed significant improvements for the intervention group having a large effect size for mental health knowledge (f = 0.574, p < 0.001, partial η2 = 0.25) and a medium effect size for help-seeking efficacy (f = 0.311, p < 0.001, partial η2 = 0.09). Conclusion: The first-time application and evaluation of an adapted mental health literacy school curriculum shows significant increases in mental health knowledge and help-seeking efficacy, two core dimensions of mental health literacy, among 10th grade students in Germany. Further studies are needed to confirm these results as well as have a more in-depth analysis on the interrelations of the different dimensions of mental health knowledge and help-seeking practices. © © 2023 Freţian, Kirchhoff, Bauer and Okan.

AB  - Purpose: Despite the susceptibility to the experience of mental distress during adolescence, this population often demonstrate poor help-seeking behaviours. Efforts have been made by schools to address adolescents’ knowledge around mental health; less focus has been given to addressing their knowledge of mental health services and avenues for help-seeking. This study aimed to explore adolescents’ views of mental health services education. Methods: An interpretive descriptive design was adopted. Thirty adolescents from Ireland participated in individual interviews. Data were analysed using content analysis. Two themes were identified: Recognizing Gaps in Knowledge about Mental Health Service Education, and Enhancing Mental Health Service Education for Young People. Participants reported gaps in their knowledge about mental health services and were uncertain how to access help. Current strategies (e.g., print media) were considered tokenistic and ineffective; instead, multimedia (film/TV) approaches were recommended. Results: Two themes were identified: Recognizing Gaps in Knowledge about Mental HealthService Education, and Enhancing Mental Health Service Education for YoungPeople. Participants reported gaps in their knowledge about mental healthservices and were uncertain how to access help. Current strategies (e.g., print media) were considered tokenistic and ineffective; instead, multimedia (film/TV) approaches were recommended. Conclusions: Current mental health education programmes need to expand their focus beyond social/emotional well-being, providing adolescents with the knowledge they need to access appropriate supports. Considering traditional print media was viewed as ineffective, while film/TV had an influence on perceptions of mental health services, a multimedia approach to education may be an effective way of engaging this population. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - This chapter resulted from the monitoring throughout a semester (from September 2021 to February 2022) of a group of students and professors/facilitators, from different areas of knowledge, who participated in the Demola International Project. The aim of this chapter is to demonstrate how it can become feasible to apply the design thinking (DT) process to health contexts, with the challenge: promoting mental health literacy in higher education students on the route of promoting positive mental health. The solution to promoting mental health and preventing mental illness is to increase health literacy. In this sense, the concerns of this chapter are to find solutions to improve the low mental health literacy of higher education students and to promote their mental health, acting early in the diagnosis of mental illness. This solution was identified using the design thinking process, IDEO’s 3I’s model, making it possible to apply low-cost strategies and encourage students’ autonomy and empowerment, thus creating less dependence on external intervention. © 2023 by IGI Global.

AB  - This research aims to examine the contribution of physical activity to children's mental health education during the epidemic era. In this study, 50 5- to 6-year-old children from a city were recruited as research subjects using interviews, literature review, and experimental statistics and then randomly divided into two groups: the experimental group and the control group. The psychological index data before and after the happy exercise were measured using a questionnaire survey. The psychological index data before and after 12 weeks of experimental practice were evaluated using data statistics. Six mental health indices demonstrated a significant difference between the experimental group and the control group, with the improvement value of the experimental group's movement score being 3.68 and the improvement value of the control group's movement score being 0.15. Social score improvement in the experimental group was 1.76, whereas, in the control group, it was 0.12. The value of language score improvement was 1.16, while the language score improvement in the control group was 0.14. The gymnastics sports curriculum is favorable to the mental health development of 56-year-old children and has significantly enhanced children's mental health. © 2023 Sociedad Revista de Psicologia del Deporte.

AB  - Background: Digital cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) interventions can effectively prevent and treat depression and anxiety, but engagement with these programs is often low. Although extensive research has evaluated program use as a proxy for engagement, the extent to which users acquire knowledge and enact skills from these programs has been largely overlooked. Objective: This study aimed to investigate how skill enactment and knowledge acquisition have been measured, evaluate postintervention changes in skill enactment and knowledge acquisition, examine whether mental health outcomes are associated with skill enactment or knowledge acquisition, and evaluate predictors of skill enactment and knowledge acquisition. Methods: PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane CENTRAL were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between January 2000 and July 2022. We included RCTs comparing digital CBT with any comparison group in adolescents or adults (aged ≥12 years) for anxiety or depression. Eligible studies reported quantitative measures of skill enactment or knowledge acquisition. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for RCTs. Narrative synthesis was used to address the review questions. Results: In total, 43 papers were included, of which 29 (67%) reported a skill enactment measure and 15 (35%) reported a knowledge acquisition measure. Skill enactment was typically operationalized as the frequency of enacting skills using the completion of in-program activities (ie, formal skill enactment; 13/29, 45%) and intervention-specific (9/29, 31%) or standardized (8/29, 28%) questionnaires. Knowledge measures included tests of CBT knowledge (6/15, 40%) or mental health literacy (5/15, 33%) and self-report questionnaires (6/15, 40%). In total, 17 studies evaluated postintervention changes in skill enactment or knowledge acquisition, and findings were mostly significant for skill enactment (6/8, 75% of the studies), CBT knowledge (6/6, 100%), and mental health literacy (4/5, 80%). Of the 12 studies that evaluated the association between skill enactment and postintervention mental health outcomes, most reported ≥1 significant positive finding on standardized questionnaires (4/4, 100%), formal skill enactment indicators (5/7, 71%), or intervention-specific questionnaires (1/1, 100%). None of the 4 studies that evaluated the association between knowledge acquisition and primary mental health outcomes reported significant results. A total of 13 studies investigated predictors of skill enactment; only type of guidance and improvements in psychological variables were associated with increased skill enactment in ≥2 analyses. Predictors of knowledge acquisition were evaluated in 2 studies. Conclusions: Digital CBT for depression and anxiety can improve skill enactment and knowledge acquisition. However, only skill enactment appears to be associated with mental health outcomes, which may depend on the type of measure examined. Additional research is needed to understand what types and levels of skill enactment and knowledge acquisition are most relevant for outcomes and identify predictors of these constructs. © Hayley M Jackson, Alison L Calear, Philip J Batterham, Jeneva L Ohan, Glenda M Farmer, Louise M Farrer.

AB  - A healthy psychological state is the premise for children to carry out various activities. Previous surveys have shown that children with special needs are affected by their own obstacles and are more prone to psychological problems such as sensitivity, low self-esteem, and impulsiveness. Therefore, it is necessary to provide more systematic mental health education support for special children. Mental health education programs are an efficient form of maintaining children’s mental health. However, in the field of special education, the number of mental health education courses developed according to the physical and mental characteristics and developmental needs of special children is relatively small, and there are many difficulties in the implementation process. Autism disorder (ASD) is a kind of pervasive developmental dysfunction that is relatively common and representative in clinical practice. In recent years, the number of autistic children has continued to surge, and has gradually expanded from a family problem to a serious social problem. At present, the evaluation of the effect of autism intervention mainly relies on various behavioral scales, which are subjective to a certain extent. At the same time, due to the unclear pathogenesis of autism, the treatment of autism cannot be predicated on the right medicine, and can only be intervened in various ways. The purpose of this paper is to explore the difference between the EEG signals of autistic children and typically developing control (TD) children through the analysis method of EEG signals, and based on the analysis of EEG signals from an objective point of view, to study whether the music therapy method of Chinese Zither playing training can effectively Improving the brain functional status of children with autism yields positive therapeutic outcomes. The experimental results show that the complexity of brain electrical signals of ASD children is much lower than that of TD children, and there is a significant difference in the brain functional state between the two. The music therapy method based on Chinese zither playing training can improve the brain function of autistic patients, and there is a positive therapeutic effect. And with the extension of the training period, the effect may be more significant. Chinese zither playing training can provide a new direction for the intervention of autism. © 2023, Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction and objective: Almost half of all the people displaced worldwide are children and adolescents. Many refugee children, adolescents, and young adults suffer from psychological stress. However, their utilization of (mental) health services is low, probably due to a lack of knowledge about (mental) health and (mental) health care. The current study aimed to explore concepts of (mental) health and illness of refugee youth as well as assess their mental health literacy (MHL) to arrive at conclusions for improving mental health care access and use. Method: From April 2019 to October 2020, we conducted 24 face-to-face interviews with refugee children and adolescents in an outpatient clinic (n = 8), in youth welfare facilities (n = 10), and at a middle school (n = 6). A semi-structured interview was used to assess knowledge about mental and somatic health and illness as well as corresponding health strategies and care options. The material was evaluated using qualitative content analysis. Results: Participants (N = 24) were between 11 and 21 years old (M = 17.9, SD = 2.4). The coded material was assigned to four thematic main areas: (1) conception of illness, (2) conception of health, (3) knowledge about health care structures in their country of origin, and (4) perceptions of mental health care structures in Germany. Compared to somatic health, the interviewed refugee children and adolescents knew little about mental health. Furthermore, respondents were more aware of opportunities of somatic health promotion, but almost none knew how to promote their mental health. In our group-comparative analysis we observed that younger children possess little knowledge about mental health-related topics. Conclusion: Our results show that refugee youth have more knowledge about somatic health and somatic health care than about mental health (care). Accordingly, interventions to promote the MHL of refugee youth are necessary to improve their utilization of mental health services and to provide adequate mental health care. © © 2023 van der Meer, Durlach, Szota and Christiansen.

AB  - Background: Mental crises have high prevalences in adolescence. Early interventions appear to be highly important to diminish the risk of the deterioration, recurrence, or chronification of symptoms. In recent years, various providers have started offering live chat support in psychological crises. The messenger-based psychological counseling service krisenchat aims to support young people in crises and, if necessary, provide a recommendation for a referral to the health care system or to seek further help from a trusted adult person. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the impact of using the counseling service of krisenchat on the further help-seeking behavior of young people, and to identify associated factors of further help-seeking. Methods: This longitudinal study analyzed anonymous data from 247 individuals who used krisenchat between October 2021 and March 2022, and received a recommendation for further help-seeking. An online survey directly after the chat assessed the perceived helpfulness of the chat and well-being after the chat. After 4 weeks, further help-seeking, facilitators and barriers to help-seeking, and self-efficacy were assessed in an online follow-up survey. Results: The most frequently recommended services or persons to seek further help from included a psychotherapist or social psychiatric service (75/225, 33.3%), a school psychologist or school social worker (52/225, 23.1%), and the user's parents (45/225, 20.0%). Of the 247 users, 120 (48.6%) indicated that they contacted the recommended service or person, and of these, 87 (72.5%) stated that they already had an appointment (or talk) with the respective service or person or that an appointment (or talk) was scheduled. The most frequently reported facilitators for further help-seeking were mental health literacy (54/120, 45.0%), improvement of self-efficacy (55/120, 45.8%), and symptom recognition (40/120, 33.3%). In users not displaying further help-seeking behavior, the most frequent barriers included stigmatization (60/127, 47.2%), lack of mental health literacy (59/127, 46.5%), need for self-reliance and autonomy (53/127, 41.7%), and negative family beliefs regarding help services (53/127, 41.7%). Subgroup comparisons indicated significantly higher levels of self-efficacy in users displaying further help-seeking behavior than in those not displaying further help-seeking behavior. Both subgroups did not differ in gender, age, recommended service or person, chat topics, perceived helpfulness, and well-being. Conclusions: The findings of this study indicate that children and young adults receiving counseling on krisenchat benefit in terms of seeking further help. Further help-seeking seems to be associated with higher levels of self-efficacy. ©Sabrina Baldofski, Elisabeth Kohls, Zeki Efe, Melanie Eckert, Shadi Saee, Julia Thomas, Richard Wundrack, Christine Rummel-Kluge.

AB  - Many mental illnesses have onset during adolescence, and if untreated may have long-term negative outcomes. Parents and school counsellors can assist adolescents by monitoring for mental illness and facilitating appropriate support. The present study investigated parents' mental health literacy (MHL), preferred views of school counsellor roles, and intention to follow up referrals. Eighty-seven Australian parents of current secondary school students were recruited to an online cross-sectional survey via convenience sampling. Results showed that, on average, parents had good MHL, moderately endorsed school counsellor roles, and were committed to following up referrals. Higher MHL, but not preferred school counsellor roles, predicted intention to follow up referrals to general practitioners and specialised mental health services. Findings support targeted psychoeducational intervention for parents regarding MHL and the role of the school counsellor and directions for future research are discussed. © The Author(s), 2023.

AB  - Objective: Mental health literacy is especially important during adolescence and youth, because the peak of the onset of mental disorders occurs in this period. The present study aimed to identify the effective systemic factors for improving Iranian adolescent mental health literacy from the Perspective of policymakers and experts. Method: This qualitative study was performed on 21 policymakers and health literacy/mental health experts since May 2020 to September 2020 in the workplace of the interviewees in Tehran. Purposive sampling (snowball method) was conducted based on experience, expertise, and the willingness to participate in an interview. All interviews were conducted with the presence of the interviewer at the interviewees' workplace in Tehran. The data were collected through semi-structured interviews and analyzed via the conventional content analysis method. Results: Five themes were extracted as systemic factors for improving adolescent mental health literacy. Themes were “mental health literacy training”, “integration and coordination of stakeholder organizations”, “resources and facilities”, “continuous assessment” and “provision of information.” Conclusion: Before policy-making and planning to enhance adolescents' knowledge and awareness of mental health issues, it is necessary to attract policymakers’ attention to the macro level and identify direct and indirect strategies for the correct implementation of policies adopted in this field. © © 2023 Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

AB  - In recent years mental health has emerged as a major health threat in low income countries like India. In response, mental health care has been integrated into primary health care, in turn creating a rising demand for trained and skillful mental health professionals. This study was conducted in district Budgam (J&K), India with the aim of providing training to community health workers (CHWs) and measuring the change using pre-and post-training evaluations. The pre and post tests were undertaken, assessing changes in mental health literacy at three different points of time: pre-training, post-training, and three month follow-up. Mental health literacy was assessed using the interviewer-administered Mental Health Literacy Survey. The training intervention was a five-day course based on a facilitator’s manual developed specifically for community health workers in India. A total of 25 community health workers from rural areas of Budgam District (mostly Integrated Child Development Service supervisors), Health Educators and Anganwadi Workers, were engaged for the study. Findings demonstrate that the training course improved participants’ ability to recognize any mental health disorders. There was a clear distinction between the level of awareness pre-and post-training. The results were statistically significant on various domains Ability to recognize disorders (Pre-post P= 0.001), Knowledge of the professional help available (Pre-post p= 0.000), Attitudes that promote the recognition or appropriate help-seeking behavior (Pre-post p= 0.000) (p<0.05). Further follow up after three months was done. The mixed findings from this study, suggesting the training course has potential to improve some aspects of mental health literacy among the CHWs, including their understanding of various mental health problems. © 2023, Editura Lumen.

AB  - The mobile Internet gender psychological education curriculum for primary school students takes positive development as the core idea, which has high value for improving the quality of primary school students’ mental health education. The teaching evaluation of this course can improve the efficiency and effect of teaching, and provide reference and help for future teaching. However, the current effect evaluation methods have the problem of single evaluation. Therefore, this paper studies the evaluation method of mobile online course effect of gender psychological education for primary school students. This paper analyzes the content of gender psychology education for primary school students, and establishes a teaching model of gender psychology education on mobile networks by using the interactive relationship between learners and learning resources. Establish an evaluation index system according to the course content and teaching interaction mode. Based on the theory of fuzzy mathematics, the evaluation model of the effect of gender psychology education curriculum for primary school students is established. The corresponding weight values are obtained by using the fuzzy consistent judgment matrix, and the numerical results of comprehensive evaluation are obtained. The experimental results show that the designed course effect evaluation method can improve the accuracy of evaluation and the evaluation results are more convincing. © 2023, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.

AB  - Background. Given the high prevalence of depressive disorders in the present world and the lack of adequate awareness about prevention and appropriate interventions, increasing mental health literacy is vital for promoting mental health to reduce depression and its consequences. Methods. In this descriptive cross-sectional study, participants were recruited among the second high school students in the 2018-2019 academic year. The sample size was 2038, and samples were selected by multistage cluster sampling from different areas of Tehran. Demographic variables like age, gender, level of education, and parents' characteristics and mental health literacy questions in treatment and prevention areas were evaluated. Results. Analyses showed that of high school students, 83% considered getting help from psychiatrists and 80% considered learning stress management as the best preventive measures, while as the best treatment measures, 79.5% considered counseling the best place to refer for visiting a professional and 45% selected general counseling centers. Conclusion. The study results showed that high school students have a positive attitude toward preventing and treating depressive disorders, getting help from specialists, and useful measures for depressed people. But they did not know enough about preventive measures, including learning effective coping skills, reading self-help books, and continuing to take psychiatric medications. Planning and providing the necessary training are important, especially for high school students. © 2023 Zahra Khorrami et al.

AB  - Background: There is a pressing need to create resources to promote mental health literacy among young people. Digital media is one of the methods that can be used to successfully promote mental health literacy. Although digital mental health resources are generally favorably perceived by young people, one of the essential factors in whether they choose to use these interventions is trust. Objective: The objective of this study was to explore young people’s trust-related concerns about and recommendations for the cocreated mental health website “What’s Up With Everyone” by using TrustScapes. Our aim was to use the findings to improve the trustworthiness of the website and to inform future creators of web-based mental health resources. Methods: In total, 30 young people (mean age 19, SD 1.509; range 17-21 years) participated in TrustScapes focus groups. Thematic analysis was carried out to analyze both the TrustScapes worksheets and audio transcripts. Results: Qualitative analysis revealed that the mental health website contains elements perceived to be both trustworthy and untrustworthy by young people. The relatable and high-quality design, which was achieved by cocreating the website with a team of design professionals and young people, was considered to increase trust. Creators’ credibility also positively affected trust, but the logos and other information about the creators were recommended to be more salient for users. Suggestions were made to update the privacy policy and cookie settings and include communication functions on the platform to improve the trustworthiness of the website. Conclusions: Factors perceived to be trustworthy included the website's relatable, high-quality design and creators’ credibility, whereas those perceived to be untrustworthy included the privacy policy and cookie settings. The findings highlighted the significance of collaborating with end users and industrial partners and the importance of making the trust-enabling factors salient for users. We hope that these findings will inform future creators of web-based mental health resources to make these resources as trustworthy and effective as possible. ©Sachiyo Ito-Jaeger, Elvira Perez Vallejos, Saruka Logathasan, Thomas Curran, Paul Crawford.

AB  - Purpose: This study used the latent profile analysis technique to investigate the latent categories of high school students’ sense of hope and their relationship with mental health. Methods: A total of 1,513 high school students from six middle schools in China was tested using the Adult Dispositional Hope Scale and the Symptom Checklist 90. Analysis of variance was used to explore the relationship between latent categories of sense of hope and mental health. Results: High school students’ sense of hope scores are negatively associated with mental health scores. The high school students’ sense of hope could be divided into three latent categories: negative sense of hope group, moderate sense of hope group and positive sense of hope group. The differences in scores on each dimension of mental health among high school students with different latent categories of sense of hope were statistically significant. The positive sense of hope group had lower scores on the dimensions of somatization, compulsive symptoms, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, terror, paranoia, and psychosis than the negative sense of hope group and the moderate sense of hope group. Conclusion: There are three latent categories of high school students’ sense of hope, and the sense of hope category is closely related to mental health. Based on the different categories of high school students’ sense of hope, the program of mental health education can be reasonably selected to create a positive general environment for mental health education and ultimately enhance the mental health of high school students. © © 2023 Wang, Di, Sun, Liu and Ma.

AB  - Background: Mental health disorders are the most common perinatal conditions. They affect mothers, babies, partners, and support networks. However, <15% of pregnant and postpartum women seek timely help for their mental health care. Low perinatal mental health knowledge and universal screening unacceptability are cited as important deterrents to obtaining timely mental health care. Objective: The purpose of this quantitative cross-sectional study was 2-fold: (1) to determine African immigrant mothers' views of perinatal mental health and to identify predictors of those views and (2) to identify African immigrant mothers' views regarding perinatal mental health screening and to determine factors associated with those views. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted using a convenience sample of African immigrant women from the province of Alberta, Canada. Respondents were eligible to participate if they were aged ≥18 years, had a live birth, and the infant was aged ≤2 years. Questions were drawn from the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale, and additional questions were developed using the Alberta Maternal Mental Health 2012 survey as a guide and tested to reflect the immigrant context. Descriptive and multivariable regression analyses were conducted. Results: Among the 120 respondents, 46.5% (53/114) were aged 31-35 years, 76.1% (89/117) were employed or on maternity leave, 92.5% (111/120) were married, and 55.6% (65/117) had younger infants aged 0 to 12 months. Significantly more respondents had higher levels of knowledge of postnatal (109/115, 94.8%) than prenatal (57/110, 51.2%) mental health (P<.001). Only 25.4% (28/110) of the respondents accurately identified that prenatal anxiety or depression could negatively impact child development. Personal knowledge of postpartum anxiety and depression was a significant predictor of prenatal and postnatal mental health knowledge. Most respondents strongly agreed or agreed that all women should be screened in the prenatal (82/109, 75.2%) and postnatal (91/110, 82.7%) periods. Respondents reported that their partner would be their first choice when seeking help and support. The acceptability of postnatal screening was a significant predictor of prenatal mental health knowledge (P<.001), whereas the acceptability of prenatal screening was a significant predictor of postnatal mental health knowledge (P=.03). Prenatal mental health knowledge was a significant predictor of both prenatal (P<.001) and postnatal (P=.001) screening acceptability. Conclusions: Although African mothers' knowledge of postnatal mental health is high, their prenatal mental health knowledge and its influence on child development are limited. Perinatal mental health interventions for African immigrant mothers in Alberta should target these knowledge gaps. The high acceptability of universal perinatal mental health screening among African mothers provides a promising strategy for perinatal mental health literacy initiatives to achieve optimal perinatal mental health. © JMIR Formative Research 2023.

AB  - Although approximately a third of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) also experience a mental health concern, caregivers often miss early identification of these issues. In this perspective piece, we present an outline for a mental health literacy program that can enhance existing training approaches for caregivers of individuals with IDD. We describe three processes of the Mental Health Awareness and Advocacy (MHAA) curriculum and detail how it provides a strong preventative model to train caregivers to increase their mental health literacy. In describing these processes, we provide illustrative examples and conclude by providing a brief vignette that highlights how this process could be used by caregivers to help reduce mental health concerns in individuals with IDD. © 2023 American Association on Mental Retardation.

AB  - Interventions adopting augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) modalities allow participants to explore and experience realistic scenarios, making them useful psycho-educational tools for mental illnesses. This scoping review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of AR/VR interventions in improving (1) knowledge, (2) attitudes, (3) empathy and (4) stigma regarding people with mental illnesses. Literature on published studies in English up till April 2022 was searched within several databases. Sixteen articles were included. The majority of studies were conducted in the West (93.8%), within undergraduates (68.8%) but also amongst high school students, patients, caregivers, public including online community, and covered conditions including psychotic illnesses, dementia, anxiety and depression. A preponderance of these included studies which employed AR/VR based interventions observed improvements in knowledge (66.7%), attitudes (62.5%), empathy (100%) and reduction of stigma (71.4%) pertaining to people with mental illnesses. In the context of relatively limited studies, extant AR/VR based interventions could potentially improve knowledge, attitudes, empathy and decrease stigma regarding people with mental illness. Further research needs to be conducted in larger and more diverse samples to investigate the relatively beneficial effects of different AR/VR modalities and the durability of observed improvements of relevant outcomes of interests over time for different mental conditions. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Globally, most young people living with mental health conditions lack access to mental health care but have access to a mobile device. The growing access to mobile devices in South Africa has the potential to increase access to mental health care services through digital platforms. However, uptake of digital mental health interventions may be hampered by several factors, such as privacy, confidentiality, informed consent, and affordability. This study identified the prospects and challenges of implementing a mobile phone-based mental health intervention for young people in Ingwavuma area. Data were collected from 93 young people in three villages purposefully selected in Ingwavuma area. Participants included in the study were aged 16–24. Data were collected through a questionnaire. Thematic and descriptive analysis was performed on the qualitative and quantitative data, respectively. Mental health education was low, with only 22% of participants having received prior education on mental health. About 50% of the participants had come across a mental health app, but none of them had used any of these apps; 87% of participants had Internet access; 60% preferred to use social media to contact a health worker; and 92% suggested that use of digital apps would improve mental health literacy among young people. Barriers to access of digital mental health interventions were identified as the high cost of data, restrictive religious beliefs, limited privacy, lack of native languages on most digital platforms, low digital literacy, and complicated user interface. In uMkhanyakude, uptake of digital mental health apps among the young people was low. We recommend that, developers create context-specific digital applications catered for young people from different cultural backgrounds. Socio-economic issues such as affordability also need to be addressed in developing these tools. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The onset of many lifelong mental illnesses is during childhood and adolescence. There has been an increase in these conditions among children and adolescents especially, during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is essential to promote mental health literacy (MHL) as a preventive and universal intervention for children and adolescents. Positive mental health status in adolescence is related to an increased level of MHL, and various MHL programs at schools have been reported to be effective for adolescent students worldwide. Recently, MHL programs have been developed in South Korea to be used by schoolteachers. There is a need for active dissemination and development of future programs. For continuous and effective education, it is desirable to include MHL education in regular school curricula. © 2023 Korean Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.

AB  - Among other responsibilities, youth sport coaches are positioned to monitor and address the mental health needs of their athletes. Despite this, there are limited interventions aimed at improving coaches’ mental health literacy. Using a mixed-methods design, the aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and mental health literacy outcomes associated with a brief (75 min) workshop for youth sport coaches. Fourteen coaches (13 males, one female) completed pre-and postworkshop surveys measuring indices of mental health literacy, and 10 of these same participants engaged in a semistructured interview 1-month later. Overall, coaches who participated in the pilot workshop reported significant improvements in depression literacy, intentions to seek self-help for oneself and their athletes, and knowledge and confidence to provide help. In addition, coaches reported positive impressions of the workshop during the follow-up interviews and provided concrete examples of program content application. An important suggestion made by coaches was the need to align the workshop content to governing policy. Taken together, this pilot mental health literacy workshop for youth sport coaches shows strong promise and is ready for large-scale dissemination. © 2023 Human Kinetics, Inc.

AB  - Purpose: Effective intervention, policy, and research in mental health and well-being (MHWB) require young people to be understood not only as beneficiaries, but also as active agents in codesigning and implementing initiatives. To identify pathways for young people's participation in promoting MHWB in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), this study surveyed young people's aspirations for engagement, their spheres of influence, capacity building needs, and key barriers to participation. Methods: Using U-Report, United Nations Children's Emergency Fund's social messaging tool and data collection platform, we distributed a short quantitative survey to a nonrepresentative, but large sample of young people aged 15–29 across five LMICs: Nigeria, Brazil, Jamaica, South Africa, and Burundi. Results: A total of 42,689 young people responded, with representation from most or all provinces within each country. Participants’ average age was 23.8 years (SD = 3.77). Young people's core aspirations were to join a mental health awareness project and to support their peers. Participants considered schools and community settings to be the most important spheres for engagement. Lack of information about mental health was the main perceived barrier to participation, and mental health classes the main training need. Discussion: In many countries, MHWB is not taught or discussed in schools and youth-led mental health interventions are rare. Findings from this study reveal clear aspirations for participatory engagement to promote MHWB among young people in LMICs. To support meaningful participation, policymakers and youth service providers must ensure that young people have access to mental health literacy training and opportunities to raise awareness in schools or community settings. © 2021 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine

AB  - School-based mental health literacy (MHL) programs can increase knowledge, reduce stigma, and encourage help-seeking behaviors in school-aged children. Yet, MHL intervention effects are inconsistent and unsustainable over time, and scholars have called for more theoretical work to address these limitations. The purpose of this theoretical review is to investigate how theory is utilized in MHL interventions, explore the interpersonal communication processes integrated in MHL interventions, and uncover the theoretical assumptions made in MHL interventions about interpersonal communication. We identified 27 articles for inclusion and utilized both content and interpretive analyses. Findings suggest that very few MHL interventions are based in theory; interpersonal communication is a central component within MHL programming; and numerous assumptions are made about interpersonal communication within MHL interventions that need to be addressed theoretically and empirically. Accordingly, we recommend that MHL intervention content and delivery practices are grounded in interpersonal communication theory related to disclosure and social support (seeking and provision). Additionally, teaching disclosure and social support skills may be a productive way for MHL interventions to help students build self-efficacy in communication about mental health for themselves and others. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Asian American youth experience high rates of racism and mental health difficulties, yet are less likely to seek mental health services compared to their non-Asian peers. Due to restrictions on in-person interactions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, many mental health services have been delivered virtually since March 2020. Youth Mental Health First Aid (YMHFA) virtual training is a manualized program designed to educate adults on recognizing signs and symptoms of common adolescent mental health challenges, and how they could effectively intervene. However, there is no published research on the effectiveness of the YMHFA-virtual version. Also, there is limited research on the effectiveness of YMHFA among Asian Americans, a vulnerable population. Utilizing a pre-post design, we evaluated the effects of the virtual YMHFA that we adapted for Asian Americans. Thirty-five Asian/American adults (M<inf>age</inf> = 47.0, SD<inf>age</inf> = 8.98) participated in the YMHFA-virtual training and completed pre- and post- surveys. Significant increases were found in participants’ mental health literacy (MHL), mental health knowledge, confidence in using the mental health first aid skills, help-seeking intentions, and help-seeking attitudes, while a significant decrease was found in their stigma toward mental illnesses. The effect sizes varied from small (e.g., attitudes) to large (MHL and confidence in using MHFA skills). These promising findings have several implications. The culturally adapted YMHFA-virtual version may be an effective way to reach Asian Americans and promote mental health awareness, helpful attitudes, and confidence in supporting youth with mental health challenges in a culturally sensitive and non-threatening manner among this population. © 2022 Society of Clinical Child & Adolescent Psychology.

AB  - This study aims to investigate the psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescents with type-1-diabetes (T1D). We conducted 18 semi-structured interviews including adolescents with T1D (n = 10, 50% female, 15-18 years) and their parents (n = 8, 88% mothers). The main topics addressed were experiences during confinement regarding everyday life, lifestyle behaviors, diabetes management and treatment. We applied thematic analysis to identify common patterns of meanings. Being aware of belonging to a potential COVID-19 risk group caused worries especially in parents which resulted in strict adherence to preventive measures. Information from trustworthy sources regarding the actual risk mitigated the concerns. Digital diabetes treatment was well accepted and experienced as highly usable. The pandemic situation either facilitated or hindered the transition from parental control to diabetes self-management. While some patients managed to improve healthy lifestyle behaviors as their everyday lives seemed more predictable, others had difficulties in adapting to changed daily routines resulting in increased sedentary behavior and snacking. The perceived level of stress was directly associated with blood glucose levels. In conclusion, the implementation of psychological interventions (both for adolescents with T1D and their parents) addressing mental health literacy and media literacy seems to be important to promote positive coping skills for dealing with the pandemic situation. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Mental health literacy (MHL) encompasses understanding mental health and learning how to obtain and maintain good mental health. Increasing MHL may increase help-seeking behaviors and positive mental health. This study aimed to identify school-based MHL interventions for children/youth using a scoping review methodology following the Johanna Briggs Model. The interventions were assessed for quality of evidence using the National Institutes of Health Study Quality Assessment Tools. Six databases were searched: Scopus, APA PsycInfo, Cochrane Library, ERIC, PubMed, and ProQuest Psychology. Search terms included “mental health literacy,” “intervention,” and “children.” The search yielded 27 studies after applying inclusion criteria. Eight of these studies were assessed as “poor” quality, twelve as “fair” quality, and seven as “good” quality. The results highlight the need for more research to implement and evaluate interventions to sustainably and feasibly incorporate school-based MHL interventions for children and youth into practice. Impact Statement Mental health literacy interventions are needed to improve knowledge of mental health, promote help-seeking for mental illness, and reduce stigma and negative attitudes toward mental illness. This review identifies that more good quality research is required of school-based mental health literacy interventions. New research is urgently needed to evaluate the feasibility and sustainability of interventions that reduce the prevalence of mental illness for children and youth. © 2022 National Association of School Psychologists.

AB  - People who have experienced mental health problems often encounter stigmatisation, mainly by professional mental health care providers. Therefore, involvement of experts by experience in courses taught at a higher education institution that provides training for future healthcare professionals aims at destigmatising mental illnesses. Peer trainers have a lived mental health problems experience who take on the role of trainers to present the latest mental health care trends and theories and introduce recovery elements into the educational process. The data on which the article is based were gathered over a period of three years from focus groups involving 2nd year students of the bachelor’s degree programme of ‘Clinical Social Worker’. The results obtained clearly show the destigmatising effect of this type of teaching: what has proven to be crucial in this regard was, on the one hand, the experience of former patients, and on the other hand, a counterweight to the often-one-sided information prevalent in professional literature on mental health available in the Czech Republic. The teaching reinforced the students’ ability to work in a multidisciplinary team together with a peer support worker and also undermined any prejudice they may have had towards people with mental health problems. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: Psychological vulnerability (PV) indicates the individual’s inability to adapt to stressful situations. Adolescents experience negative impacts on their future mental health if they do not acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to have good mental health during their developmental stage. Aim: To compare the PV index among the three stages of adolescence and to explore the factors involved in good mental health, including the relationship between adolescents’ PV indices and sociodemographic variables, and the relationship between adolescents’ PV index and their knowledge of the factors that characterize good mental health. Method: An exploratory, cross-sectional, correlational study was carried out in three public schools in a region of Portugal, using online self-completed questionnaires: the Psychological Vulnerability Scale (PVS) and the Mental Health-Promoting Knowledge (MHPK-10). Results: Our convenience sample consisted of 260 adolescents, with a mean age of 14.07 years who were students between 5th and 12th grades, mostly female. Moderate PV indexes were obtained that were higher in late adolescence, i.e., in older adolescents, who were females in a more advanced school year, with worse self-perceptions of their physical and mental health and body image, and who frequently used a health service due to mental health problems. The association between the PV index and the level of knowledge about the factors involved in good mental health did not reach a statistical significance (p = 0.06). Conclusions: These results suggest a need for a design of personalized interventions that promote adolescents’ mental health literacy, that prevent PV, and that should be initiated in early adolescence. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Widespread adolescent involvement in organized sport means that sport contexts are well-suited to ‘actively’ integrate prevention programs that may promote population-level change. This mixed methods study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a peer-based mental health literacy intervention. The intervention (i.e., Team Talk) was presented to eleven adolescent sport teams in the United States, with a total of 174 participants. Athlete participants completed surveys immediately before and after the intervention—including measures of workshop acceptability, social identity, and help-seeking behaviors. Semi-structured interviews were also conducted with a subset of five athletes, nine parents, and two coaches. With respect to recruitment as an indicator of feasibility, club-level adoption of the intervention was low, with difficulty recruiting clubs for intervention delivery. This signals that feasibility of the intervention–as it is currently designed and implemented by the research team–is low when considering similar competitive adolescent sport clubs and delivered as team-level workshops. Meanwhile, participants reported high acceptability of the intervention, and acceptability levels across participants was predicted by contextual factors related to implementation such as session duration. Regarding limited efficacy testing with measures completed before and after the intervention session: (a) social identity scores increased following the intervention, and (b) significant differences were not identified regarding efficacy to recognize symptoms of mental disorders. Athlete, coach, and parent interview responses also described potential adaptations to mental health programs. This research demonstrates the potential utility of peer-based mental health literacy interventions, while also revealing that further implementation research is necessary to adapt mental health literacy interventions to suit diverse adolescent sport contexts. © 2022 Public Library of Science.

AB  - Introduction Physician assistant (PA) students are at increased risk for anxiety and depression compared with the general population. The demands of studying medicine can contribute to a decline in mental health, which may impede a student's ability to progress in his or her PA program. Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) is one strategy that can be used to increase mental health literacy, promote help-seeking behavior, reduce stigma, and improve confidence in providing help to individuals showing signs of a mental health disorder. The aim of this outcomes assessment was to assess PA students' satisfaction with the MHFA course and their posttraining confidence in using the skills learned. Methods Participants were PA students (N = 435) across 9 PA programs in their didactic year of training who had completed an MHFA course through the PA Foundation's Mental Health Outreach Fellowship. MHFA postcourse evaluations, completed by the PA students, were analyzed to determine PA students' satisfaction with the course and their posttraining confidence in using the skills learned to help both themselves as well as the general population. Results The mean of the MHFA course evaluation items corresponding to satisfaction with the course was 4.82 (maximum score of 5), and the mean of the items corresponding to posttraining confidence in using the skills learned was 4.74 (maximum score of 5). When asked, “Would you recommend this course to others?” 99.3% of the PA students trained in MHFA answered “yes, ” indicating a high level of satisfaction with the training they had received. DIscussion PA students who received MHFA training from the PA Foundation's Mental Health Outreach fellows showed high levels of satisfaction with the MHFA course and posttraining confidence in using the skills learned. © © 2022 Physician Assistant Education Association.

AB  - Background:: Mental Health Literacy (MHL) has become a focus of research in recent decades, as a prerequisite for early identification and intervention for mental health problems. Although several instruments have been developed for assessing MHL, there is a need for brief and psychometrically sound measures to capture important aspects of MHL in large and diverse adult samples. The present study aimed to: (1) provide a revised and shorter version of a previously validated questionnaire for assessing MHL; and (2) examine the psychometric properties of the MHLq-SVa in student samples from six different countries (China, India, Indonesia, Portugal, Thailand, and United States). Methods:: The study involved 2180 senior school and undergraduate students, aged between 17 and 25 years old, from China, India, Indonesia, Portugal, Thailand, and the United States. Participants responded to the Mental Health Literacy Questionnaire for young adults (MHLq-ya), in their native language, following its translation and adaptation for each culture. The MHLq-ya comprises 29 items, organized into four dimensions: Knowledge of mental health problems; Erroneous beliefs/stereotypes; First-aid skills and help-seeking behavior; Self-help strategies. Confirmatory factor analyses and internal consistency analyses were performed on the combined data. Results:: Data from the different countries supported a shorter version of the questionnaire (MHLq-SVa), composed of 16 items that fit with previously defined dimensions. Internal consistency and between-factor correlations further supported the adequacy of the instrument’s psychometric properties. Conclusion:: The study provided preliminary support for the construct validity and reliability of the MHLq-SVa as a measure for assessing MHL in young adults from six different countries and languages. Future studies are needed to further validate the measure and undertake multicultural comparisons of MHL in diverse samples from around the globe. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Poor mental health literacy (MHL) is considered a significant barrier to medical students seeking treatment for depression and suicide. This study aimed to assess the level of mental health literacy of depression and suicide among undergraduate medical students as well as to determine its predictors. An online survey was conducted on 361 undergraduate medical students through the Microsoft Team platform using a Google form application-structured questionnaire that included a sociodemographic section, the depression literacy scale (D-Lit), and the modified suicide literacy scale (LOSS). Results: The mean D-Lit score was 7.9 ± 1.8 (total score ranged from 0 to 22), while the mean LOSS score was 4.5 ± 1.7 (total score ranged from 0 to 12). Only 36.8% of students had depression literacy levels higher than the mean depression score, whereas 28.8% had a suicide literacy level exceeding the mean suicide score. A statistically significant positive correlation was revealed between the mean score of depression literacy and that of suicide literacy (r = 0.16, p-value = 0.002). Male gender (p < 0.05), family history of depression (p < 0.05), and history of suicidal ideations (p < 0.01) are all predictors of higher depression literacy scores. Conclusions: According to the results, there is compelling evidence that depression and suicide literacy among medical students was low. Therefore, rather than waiting until a medical student reaches the clinical years, mental health education should be introduced early in medical school curricula or even in high school. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: The lack of child and adolescent mental health (CAMH) policies and implementation plans constitute major barriers to CAMH services in low resource settings. Engaging with on-the-ground stakeholders to identify possible contextually appropriate strategies for developing a CAMH collaborative system and inform CAMH plans and policies is important to ensure that resultant policies and plans are feasible and appropriate. Together with key stakeholders across multiple sectors, this study aims to (i) co-identify causal factors and potential strategies to overcome bottlenecks in one district in SA as a case study; and (ii) Co-develop a Theory of Change (ToC) for increasing access to CAMH services within the resource constraints of a remote resource-scarce district as a case study. Methods: A participatory workshop was held with key stakeholders (n = 40) from the Departments of Health (DoH), Basic Education (DBE), and Social Development (DSD) and three community-based organisations offering CAMH services in the district. The stakeholders identified context-specific causal factors and possible strategies to address the bottlenecks in the workshop. All the factors identified in the workshop were compared and consolidated. A ToC map was developed based on the data obtained from the workshop. The ToC was further refined by conducting a follow-up virtual workshop with stakeholders (n = 15). Results: Mapping out the strategies identified in the workshop facilitated the development of a ToC model for the resource-scarce context. Key multilevel and multisectoral task-sharing strategies emerged in support of the development of a collaborative system of care that includes the development of (i) community awareness programs and user-friendly CAMH psychoeducation and screening tools to strengthen mental health literacy and facilitate early identification at the community level; (ii) an intersectoral working group to facilitate intersectoral collaboration (iii) a functional district CAMH referral system, (iv) youth-friendly CAMH care packages. Conclusions: In scarce-resource contexts, it is feasible to work collaboratively with key stakeholders across multiple sectors to identify feasible multilevel and multisectoral strategies that can be used to develop a ToC for improved access to CAMH services within a task-sharing approach. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: teen Mental Health First Aid (tMHFA) is a universal mental health literacy, stigma reduction, help-seeking, and suicide prevention program designed for adolescents in Years 10–12 of secondary school (16–18 years). tMHFA is delivered by trained instructors, in a regular classroom setting, to increase the knowledge, attitudes and behaviours that adolescents’ require to better support peers with mental health problems or mental health crises. Methods: To explore the efficacy of tMHFA, a cluster crossover randomised controlled trial was conducted with Year 10 students in four schools in Victoria, Australia, using physical first aid training as the control intervention. Of the 1942 eligible students, 1,624 completed baseline and 894 completed follow-up surveys. Online surveys, administered one week before training and again 12-months later, included vignettes depicting peers John (depression and suicide risk) and Jeanie (social anxiety/phobia), measures of mental health first aid (quality of first aid intentions, confidence, first aid behaviours provided, and first aid behaviours received), mental health literacy (beliefs about adult help, help-seeking intentions), and stigma (social distance, weak-not-sick, dangerous/unpredictable, and would not tell anyone). Results: The primary outcome—quality of first aid intentions towards the John vignette—showed statistically significant group x time interactions, with tMHFA students reporting more helpful and less unhelpful first aid intentions, than PFA students did over time. Confidence in providing first aid also showed significant interactions. First aid behaviours—both those provided to a peer with a mental health problem and those received from a peer—showed null results. Ratings of both beliefs about adult help and help-seeking intentions were found to be significantly improved among tMHFA students at follow-up. A group x time interaction was found on one stigma scale (would not tell anyone). Conclusions: This trial showed that, one year after training, tMHFA improves first aid intentions towards peers with depression and suicide risk, confidence in helping peers with mental health problems, willingness to tell someone and seek help from an adult or health professional if experiencing a mental health problem.

AB  - Background: Interventions designed to increase mental health awareness in sport have grown substantially in the last 5 years, meaning that those involved in policy, research and intervention implementation are not fully informed by the latest systematic evaluation of research, risking a disservice to healthcare consumers. Hence, our aim was to update a 2017 systematic review that determined the effect of sport-specific mental health awareness programmes to improve mental health knowledge and help-seeking among sports coaches, athletes and officials. We extended the review to incorporate parents as a source of help-seeking and report the validity of outcome measures and quality of research design that occurred since the original review. Methods: Sport-specific mental health awareness programmes adopting an experimental or quasi-experimental design were included for synthesis. Five electronic databases were searched: Psychinfo, Medline (OVID interface), Scopus, Cochrane and Cinahl. Each database was searched from its year of inception to June 2020. As all of the outcomes measured were derived from psychometric scales, we observed statistically significant quantitative effects on the basis of p <.05, and a small, medium or large effect size as d =.2,.5 or.8, respectively. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane and QATSQ tools. Results: Twenty-eight articles were included from the 2048 retrieved, eighteen additional articles since the original review. Eighteen studies targeted athletes, five with coaches, one sport officials (i.e. referees), one ‘at-risk children’ and three with parents. One of the studies was a combination of athletes, coaches and parents. In terms of study outcomes, health referral efficacy was improved in seven studies; twelve studies reported an increase in knowledge about mental health disorders. Proportionally, higher quality research designs were evident, as three of ten studies within the previous review did not demonstrate a high risk of bias, whereas thirteen of the eighteen additional studies did not display a high risk of bias. However, only one study included a behaviour change model in both the programme design and evaluation. Conclusions: Our updated systematic review provides evidence of the benefits of mental health awareness interventions in sport; these benefits are mainly for athletes and show improvements in the methodological design of recent studies compared to the first review. There was also evidence of the extension of programme delivery to parents. In conclusion, researchers, practitioners and policy makers should consider methodological guidance and the application of theory when developing and evaluating complex interventions.

AB  - Background: The beliefs and attitudes of caregivers of working children about mental health issues and first aid and their attitudes about the stigma of mental health problems can affect their motivation to seek professional help for affected children. This study aimed to assess the mental health literacy among caregivers of child labor about first aid for mental health and their attitudes about the stigma of mental disorders. Methods: The Depression Health Literacy Questionnaire has been used in this cross-sectional study. All caregivers of working children who were willing to participate were included in the study. This group is covered by a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) located in the 17th district of Tehran. Results: Questionnaires completed by 131 caregivers were analyzed. The average age of the participants was 32.6 (± 7.9) years. Of which 130 (99.2%) were mothers. Amongst, only 37 individuals (28.2%) were confident in their ability to help their children in case of depression symptoms. A majority of participants, 109 (83.2%), believed that asking a depressed child about suicidal ideation was harmful. Conclusion: According to the findings of this study, the literacy among caregivers of child labor about mental health first aid in our study needs to be improved. There is also a need for educational and community-based programs to reduce the stigma about mental health disorders, including depression. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Mental health literacy (MHL) is an evolving concept encompassing knowledge of mental illness, help-seeking options, perceived stigma, and discrimination. This study aimed to test the effectiveness of a human library intervention at enhancing MHL. A human library intervention was adopted to enhance MHL in this study. The human library intervention aims to establish a positive framework and safe space for dialogue between readers and a ‘human book’. It works to promote dialogue, reduce prejudice, and encourage understanding of people who are regarded as disadvantaged or in a minority group. Methods: An experimental approach with a multigroup pretest–posttest design was adopted. Forty-five participants aged between 18 and 23 years were recruited and randomly assigned to the experimental group (human library intervention), comparison group (didactic teaching session), or control group (no intervention). Adapted vignette-based MHL scale scores were used as the outcome measures. The overall and subscale scores were included in the analysis. Results: The human library intervention group showed a significant improvement in overall MHL compared with the other two groups. In a multivariate analysis of the variance in subscale scores, the intervention was shown to significantly reduce stigma and preferred social distance, but had no significant effect on knowledge acquisition. Conclusions: The human library intervention is effective at enhancing overall MHL and reducing stigma and preferred social distance. Further studies are suggested to further develop the MHL construct, human library interventions, and the MHL scales for consolidating evidence-based practice. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Anxiety disorders are often the first presentation of psychopathology in youth and are considered the most common psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents. This study aimed to identify distinct student anxiety profiles to develop targeted interventions. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 9738 students in Yingshan County. Background characteristics were collected and Mental Health Test (MHT) were completed. Latent profile analysis (LPA) was applied to define student anxiety profiles, and then the analysis was repeated using k-means clustering. Results: LPA yielded 3 profiles: the low-risk, mild-risk and high-risk groups, which comprised 29.5, 38.1 and 32.4% of the sample, respectively. Repeating the analysis using k-means clustering resulted in similar groupings. Most students in a particular k-means cluster were primarily in a single LPA-derived student profile. The multinomial ordinal logistic regression results showed that the high-risk group was more likely to be female, junior, and introverted, to live in a town, to have lower or average academic performance, to have heavy or average academic pressure, and to be in schools that have never or occasionally have organized mental health education activities. Conclusions: The findings suggest that students with anxiety symptoms may be categorized into distinct profiles that are amenable to varying strategies for coordinated interventions. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background Yazidis in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq have been exposed to recurrent traumatic experiences associated with genocide and gender-based violence (GBV). In 2014, ISIS perpetrated another genocide against the Yazidi community of Sinjar. Women and girls were held captive, raped and beaten. Many have been forced into displacement. Rates of post-Traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and suicide are high. Limited research has evaluated interventions delivered to this population. Methods This review explores how the global evidence on psychosocial interventions for female survivors of conflict-related sexual violence applies to the context of the female Yazidi population. We used a realist review to explore mechanisms underpinning complex psychosocial interventions delivered to internally displaced, conflict-Affected females. Findings were cross-referenced with eight realist, semi-structured interviews with stakeholders who deliver interventions to female Yazidis in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. Interviews also allowed us to explore the impact of COVID-19 on effectiveness of interventions. Results Seven mechanisms underpinned positive mental health outcomes (reduced PTSD, depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation): safe spaces, a strong therapeutic relationship, social connection, mental health literacy, cultural-competency, gender-matching and empowerment. Interviews confirmed relevance and applicability of mechanisms to the displaced female Yazidi population. Interviews also reported increased PTSD, depression, suicide and flashbacks since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, with significant disruptions to interventions. Conclusion COVID-19 is just one of many challenges in the implementation and delivery of interventions. Responding to the mental health needs of female Yazidis exposed to chronic collective violence requires recognition of their sociocultural context and everyday experiences. © © The Author(s), 2022.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Worsening of adolescent mental health and exacerbated health inequalities after the COVID-19 pandemic calls for universal preventative strategies. The Mental Health Foundation's school-based Peer Education Project seeks to improve students' mental health literacy through peer educators (aged 14-18 years) teaching peer learners (aged 11-13 years) to recognise good and bad mental health, identify risk and protective factors, and seek help accordingly. Although previous before and after quantitative assessments have found the intervention to be effective, this realist evaluation aimed to qualitatively develop the theory of change, exploring how the mechanisms played out in different contexts to achieve the desired outcomes. METHODS: Our initial programme theory was developed following expert stakeholder consultation and reviewing the literature. We divided mechanisms into resources and reasoning to explain how the intervention components (ie, resources), experienced within specific contexts, engendered responses in the participants (ie, reasoning), to produce observable outcomes. Data collected from six purposively recruited schools in England comprised staff interviews (n=11), student focus groups (n=15), and observations (n=5). Deductive and inductive analysis was undertaken, using NVivo-informed multiple causal statements represented as context-mechanism-outcome configurations (CMOcs), to test and refine the programme theory. FINDINGS: We created several distinct CMOcs. For example, in learners accustomed to didactic teaching methods (context), conversing with educators having similar life experience (mechanism resource) endorsed and destigmatised help-seeking behaviour (mechanism reasoning) and facilitated a realisation that seeking help was appropriate and acceptable (outcome). Other mechanisms included the following: learners perceiving the information as tailored and relevant, educators feeling empowered, and a cultural shift percolating across the school. INTERPRETATION: Our findings show how peer education can work to improve mental health literacy, which will inform changes to the intervention to maximise its effectiveness in different operational contexts. Future research could test our theory of change in a randomised controlled trial, and examine impacts on inequalities in a more diverse sample.

AB  - Background We aimed to improve mental health referral quality of young people by helping educators build capacity for early identification of youth at risk of mental illness and facilitate referrals between the education and health systems. Methods We applied the Go-To Educator mental health literacy training for early identification, triage and support in 208 schools in Calgary, Alberta between 2013 and 2016. Students presenting to mental health services during this time were compared on a number of clinical, system, and demographic variables, based on the training status of the school (untrained schools; before and after training schools), using retrospective cohort design. Based on clinical and system data, bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis were employed to compare the three school status domains. Results After training, referrals differed significantly from control and pre-training schools. Students presenting to services from these schools were younger, from single parent families; were referred more because of adjustment and learning/attention problems; had complex social/ family issues; thought disturbances, and harmful behavior/thoughts towards others. While they waited longer to be admitted they stayed longer in services; had more provisional comorbid diagnoses and demonstrated positive treatment outcomes. Conclusions The Go-To Educator training may be an effective intervention helping educators identify students at risk of mental disorders and in substantial need of mental health services, demonstrating improved linkages between education and health sectors. © 2022 Baxter et al.

AB  - Background: Primary care is often the first point of contact for people living with mental disorders. Community pharmacists, pharmacy staff and students are increasingly being trained to deliver mental health care. However, there is still a gap in the literature exploring the characteristics of all available mental health training programs and their components and their influence on pharmacists, pharmacy staff and students’ outcomes. Objectives: To summarize the evidence evaluating mental health training programs completed by community pharmacists, pharmacy staff and students. More specifically, to explore the components of mental health training programs and identify those that facilitate significant improvements in outcomes. Methods: A systematic review was conducted following the Cochrane handbook and reported according to PRISMA guidelines. A search for published literature was conducted in three databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) in July 2021. Eligible studies were included if they described and evaluated the impact of mental health training programs delivered to community pharmacists, pharmacy staff and pharmacy students regardless of design or comparator. The methodological quality of included studies was appraised using both the NIH quality assessment, to evaluate studies with an uncontrolled pre-post design, and the Cochrane EPOC risk of bias assessment, to evaluate studies with a controlled (randomized and non-randomized) study design. Results: Thirty-three studies were included. Most of the identified mental health training programs contained knowledge-based components and active learning activities. Changes in participants' attitudes, stigma, knowledge, confidence and skills were frequently assessed. An extensive range of self-assessment and observational instruments used to evaluate the impact of the training programs were identified. Positive improvements in participants’ attitudes, knowledge and stigma were frequently identified following participation in training programs. Conclusions: This systematic review highlights the importance of mental health training programs in increasing pharmacists', pharmacy staff and pharmacy students’ skills and confidence to deliver mental health care in community pharmacy. Future research should build upon this basis and further focus on finding the most efficient measures to evaluate these training programs and assess their long-term effectiveness, allowing comparison between programs. © The Authors

AB  - Topic: The concept of mental health literacy (MHL) was defined as the knowledge and beliefs about mental disorders that help in their recognition, management, or prevention. The complexity of interventions to promote adolescents' MHL requires that they be investigated through a process of development, feasibility/piloting, evaluation, and implementation, according to Medical Research Council (MRC) Framework. Purpose: This article aimed to identify the theory that supports the development of a psychoeducational intervention to promote adolescents' MHL in schools, possibly to be developed by mental health and psychiatric nurses. Sources Used: Journal articles, books, reports, and regulations. Conclusions: This theory allows us to design a psychoeducational intervention to promote adolescents' MHL in schools and supports the subsequent phases of the MRC Framework. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - This research explored parents' mental health literacy (MHL) skills (i.e., recognizing symptoms and identifying effective help-seeking strategies) for child attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and anxiety, factors associated with their MHL, and preferences for receiving information about each disorder. N = 128 parents were recruited from community organizations to participate in an online survey. Parents were randomly assigned to read one vignette depicting a child with symptoms of ADHD or anxiety. They were asked to identify the depicted problem and rate the helpfulness of potential help-seeking strategies (i.e., different health professionals and medications). They also completed measures of parental self-efficacy and parenting stress and indicated information preferences for learning about symptoms and treatment. Parents scored just above the mid-range on a measure of their MHL skills, with no significant difference between parents responding to the ADHD and anxiety vignettes. Stronger MHL was associated with being a mother, having personal, family, or friend-related mental health experience, and stronger parental self-efficacy. Parents were interested in receiving more information about child ADHD and anxiety via health provider or written format. Results are valuable for informing future MHL intervention efforts to educate parents about symptoms and treatment for common child mental health problems such as ADHD and anxiety. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Mental health literacy (MHL) interventions in secondary schools may help to improve competencies that adolescents require to stay mentally healthy and seek help if mental health problems arise. These MHL interventions should be tailored to the needs of adolescents and educational professionals (EPs) to reach sustainable implementation and long-term effectiveness. However, evidence is lacking on these needs. Thus, our aim was to explore their experiences with, and perspectives on, mental health help seeking and needs regarding MHL interventions. We performed online focus group discussions and interviews with adolescents (n = 21; 13–19 years) and EPs (n = 12) and analyzed the data using directed content analysis. We identified three themes related to mental health help seeking: (1) Limited MHL competencies of adolescents, (2) Limited competencies of EP to provide mental health support, and (3) Limited mental health promotion in the school environment. We further identified three themes regarding MHL interventions: (1) Addressing basic mental health knowledge and skills, (2) Interactive and easily accessible, and (3) Sustainable implementation. Improving the MHL competencies of adolescents and EPs, and creating a mental health-literate school environment can promote adolescents’ mental health help seeking. Our findings highlight the importance of developing MHL interventions that are tailored to both adolescents’ and EPs needs. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - What is known on the subject?: Mental Health First Aid Training Programmes with a pathogenic perspective are implemented worldwide for different participants and contexts. These interventions can promote the medicalization and psychiatrization movement of human suffering. Training programmes should teach about mental health nursing problems rather than disorders. However, there seem to be no studies describing these healthier interventions targeting adolescents in upper secondary schools. Nurses can explore these interventions and target them towards these participants and contexts. What the paper adds to existing knowledge?: The perspective of nurses on the characteristics of Mental Health First Aid Training Programmes for adolescents in Portuguese upper secondary schools is reported. Experts recognize that the nurses who perform these interventions must have personal, pedagogical and mental health competencies. Therefore, mental health nurses may be considered. The components of mental health literacy, mental health nursing problems and a dynamic first aid plan can be taught using different classroom training strategies. What are the implications for practice?: The role of mental health nurses in promoting health literacy is highlighted. They have the opportunity to lead multidisciplinary teams in using these healthier training programmes. These expert opinions can shape the planning, implementation and evaluation of these interventions. In turn, training programmes can promote the identification, assistance and/or adequate and timely referral of people with mental health nursing problems. Abstract: Introduction Mental Health First Aid Training Programmes performed by nurses can empower adolescents to aid people with mental health problems. There do not appear to be any studies that describe these healthier interventions aimed at adolescents in upper secondary schools. The development of these educational interventions benefits from the input of their participants and facilitators. Aim To explore the perspective of nurses about Mental Health First Aid Training Programmes for adolescents in upper secondary schools. Method A qualitative, descriptive and exploratory study was conducted. Data were collected from seven mental health nurses during two focus group sessions. Data were analysed using content analysis. Results Twelve themes were identified around nine main areas: facilitators, intervention foci, outcomes assessment methods, process assessment methods, participants, implementation context, duration and frequency, intervention methods and strategies, and contents. Discussion Mental health nurses can regularly perform these classroom interventions to improve the mental health competencies of adolescents. Various educational methods can facilitate learning related to mental health literacy components, mental health nursing problems and the first aid plan. Valid and appropriate assessment methods enhance a good representation of these interventions. Implications for Practice This evidence can guide the creation and modelling of these first aid training programmes. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Asian Americans are the fastest-growing racial group in the United States. Contrary to the model minority myth, many Asian American youth experience mental health challenges. However, they are less likely to utilize school-based mental health services than their non-Asian American peers. A paucity of research addresses Asian American adolescents' understanding of mental health disorders and beliefs about helpful strategies for addressing psychological challenges within the school context. The present study utilized vignettes and semi-structured interviews with 24 Asian American adolescents (M = 16.92, SD = 2.45, 79.17% females) to explore their understanding of eating disorders and depression and what they perceive as helpful strategies to address mental health challenges at school. Participants shared culture-specific risk factors for these mental health disorders, such as high academic pressure, sociocultural pressures for thinness, and internalized model minority stereotype. Participants also proposed strategies to support youth mental health, including providing support, encouraging professional help-seeking, reducing stigma, addressing confidentiality concerns, implementing school-wide programs to promote mental health awareness, promoting positive coping strategies, and establishing strong connections between mental health providers and Asian American students. We discuss practical implications for school-based mental health programs, practices, and providers. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Background: Over the last decade there has been increased recognition about the role of school staff in preventing mental ill health and promoting wellbeing in young people. Despite this, information regarding the long-term benefits of school mental health programs is not widely available. Aims: The aim of this systematic review was to synthesize the evidence for school-based mental health and wellbeing programs which are available in Australia and have been shown to have long-term benefits for children and adolescents. Results: This systematic review of the literature identified 74 articles reporting long-term outcomes for student mental health and wellbeing, distributed across 29 unique programs. Common features of efficacious programs included cognitive behavioral interventions, mental health literacy, and social-emotional skills programs. Conclusions: Some of the identified school-based interventions for student mental health and wellbeing demonstrated long-term positive impacts on students' physical and psychological health and wellbeing. © © 2022 Berger, Reupert, Allen and Campbell.

AB  - Introduction: There is a need to change the culture within the art of dance, as it has been associated with injuries and mental health consequences. This study evaluates an intervention designed to increase mental health literacy, enhance nutritional knowledge, reduce symptoms and effects of low energy availability, and strengthen understanding of sports nutrition and recovery strategies, in dance students of mixed genders. Material and methods: A total of 125 dance students received three workshops, with 39 arts and crafts students serving as references. The results were evaluated by the Eating Disorder Examination questionnaire, the Low Energy Availability in Females questionnaire, the Hopkins Symptom Check List, and questions on mental health literacy, sports nutrition, and recovery knowledge. Results: Dance students achieved sustained improvements in mental health and nutrition knowledge and temporary improvements in driven exercise (i.e., performing exercise because of a compulsive drive). No other benefits were identified from the intervention. Conclusion: Our findings indicate the need for an ongoing education program to reduce the occurrence and development of negative mental health outcomes and low energy availability in professional dance students. Such approaches may not only improve the mental health of dance students but also potentially prevent the high frequency of injuries. © © 2022 Mathisen, Sundgot-Borgen, Anstensrud and Sundgot-Borgen.

AB  - School violence is defined as the threat or use of force with the intention of causing harm, either at school or during school-related activities. Every year millions of K-12 students experience hostile behaviors including bullying, hate speech, and hate crimes while in school. Hostile behaviors in schools can negatively affect K-12 students' short- and long-term mental health, education, income, and overall well-being. In recent years, the U.S. Departments of Education and Justice have issued reminders to schools about their obligations to address harassment and discrimination. School-based prevention and intervention programs are designed to address a variety of issues faced by youth today, both within and outside of schools. © 2022 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Background: School-based mental health promotion aims to strengthen mental health and reduce stress. Results on the effectiveness of such programs are heterogeneous. This study realized a school-based mental health promotion program (StresSOS) for all students and aimed to identify moderators (mental health status, gender, grade level) of pre- to post-changes in stress symptoms and knowledge. Methods: Participants were N = 510 adolescents (from 29 classes; 46.7% female) aged 12–18 years (M = 13.88, SD = 1.00; grade levels 7–10). They were without mental health problems (65.9%), at risk for mental health problems (21.6%), or with mental health problems (12.5%) and participated in a 90 min per week face-to-face training with 8 sessions in class at school. Demographic variables, mental health status, stress symptoms, and knowledge about stress and mental health were collected at baseline. Program acceptance, stress symptoms, and knowledge were collected post-intervention. Multilevel mixed effects models were conducted with the fixed effects time (within factor), mental health status, gender, and grade level (between factors). Random effects for students within classes were included. Results: In the pre-post comparison, mental health status moderated the changes on psychological stress symptoms (p < 0.05). In adolescents with mental health problems the largest reduction in stress symptoms was observed between pre- and post-assessment. Gender and grade level were less relevant. For all adolescents knowledge gains were revealed (p < 0.001). Program acceptance was moderated by mental health status and grade level (p < 0.01). Mentally healthy adolescents and within the group of adolescents at-risk or with mental health problems, especially younger students (7th/8th grade), rated program acceptance higher. Conclusion: Psychological stress symptoms decreased among adolescents with mental health problems and not among adolescents at risk for or without mental health problems. Mental health-related knowledge increased for all adolescents. The results add to knowledge on school-based mental health intervention research and practice. Its implications for different prevention strategies (universal, selective or a combination of both) are discussed. © © 2022 Lehner, Gillé, Baldofski, Bauer, Becker, Diestelkamp, Kaess, Krämer, Lustig, Moessner, Rummel-Kluge, Thomasius, Eschenbeck and the ProHEAD Consortium.

AB  - Background: This study evaluated the effectiveness of a comprehensive mental health literacy (MHL) educational programme known as “Sanita” for improving junior high school students’ knowledge of mental illness, attitudes towards people with mental health problems, and help-seeking behaviour. Methods: A randomised controlled trial with a parallel-group design was conducted. A total of 125 students (51 in the intervention group and 74 in the control group) received three 50-min classes and completed self-report questionnaires (Mental Illness and Disorder Understanding Scale, MIDUS; Reported and Intended Behaviour Scale, RIBS-J; and an original questionnaire investigating help-seeking behaviour) before and after the programme and three months later. Results: Regarding MIDUS, the post-test and 3-month follow-up test results showed a significant main effect of time-by-group interactions in a linear mixed model. Regarding RIBS-J, the post-test results showed a significant main effect of time-by-group interactions; however, the 3-month follow-up test showed no significant effect. No significant effects of time-by-group interactions were seen in the post-test and 3-month follow-up test results for help-seeking behaviour in a logistic regression-mixed model. Conclusions: The Sanita MHL educational programme was longitudinally effective at improving junior high school students’ knowledge of mental illness, although improvements in attitudes and help-seeking behaviour were insufficient. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Several evidence-based programs to improve mental health literacy (MHL) are available; however, few have been adapted for youth athletes and sport-club settings. This systematic review aimed to investigate the impact of MHL initiatives, inclusive of education, resources and information, on the mental health of youth elite athletes. Studies were included if they examined a mental health program for young athletes (10–24 years) and reported MHL outcomes in either young people or their extended support network. A systematic search of the PubMed, Scopus and SPORTDiscus databases was conducted with no language or publication restrictions from July 2020 until September 2020. Thirteen studies were included for analysis in the review. Six studies included adolescent athletes, four studies included parents of adolescent athletes, six studies included coaching staff and three studies included female athletic populations. Five of these studies were qualitative and eight quantitative. The broad study search identified a lack of well designed, intervention-based research on MHL programs for youth elite athletes despite high demand for context specific programs. No literature that met eligibility criteria addressed MHL in youth female elite athletes exclusively. These findings limit dissemination and program transferability. This study also reinforces the influence parents and coaches have on the mental wellbeing of young elite athletes. To enhance the quality of MHL initiatives, programs developers should focus on the development of tailored resources for youth athletes with a gendered focus and incorporating opportunities for coach and parent engagement. © 2022

AB  - What is known on the subject?: Experts by experience involvement in the education of health professionals demonstrate positive attitudinal change. Meaningful positions for Experts by Experience are limited and ad hoc, due to attitudinal and other barriers to innovation within the higher education sector. Experiences of allies who have supported the implementation of Expert by Experience positions have not been researched. This is important knowledge that could be utilized by potential allies. What the paper adds to existing knowledge?: Academic allies to experts by experience have a crucial role to play in identifying opportunities to establish, implement and sustain expert by experience positions. Allies who have successfully implemented positions for experts by experience have identified influential factors including: right person, right role, collaboration and coproduction, support, and career pathways. Understanding these factors can provide an important basis for other academics to support a widespread increase in academic roles for experts by experience in mental health education. What are the implications for practice?: Establishing and maintaining genuine relationships with service users require significant attitudinal change on the part of mental health professionals. Involving experts by experience in mental health education provides an innovative approach to the challenging of attitudes and the enhancement of more collegial relationships with service users as colleagues in the workplace. This paper demonstrates the importance of allyship to the establishment, implementation and sustainability of expert by experience roles, and highlights critical factors allies have utilized in support of such roles. Nurses and other mental health professional academics have the potential to become allies and support change and innovation. Abstract: Introduction Experts by experience in academia have demonstrated more positive student attitudes towards relationships with service users. Notwithstanding this supportive evidence, academic positions for EBE have not grown substantially. Enhanced understanding of positions that have been implemented is important knowledge for others with similar aspirations. Aim To enrich understanding of the role of allies in identifying and pursuing opportunities to support academic positions for experts by experience. Methods Qualitative exploratory approach, involving In-depth interviews with allies with expertise in supporting academic positions for experts by experience. Results Participants were enthusiastic about creating or taking opportunities to secure expert by experience involvement within their programs. Factors facilitating success included right person, right role, collaboration and coproduction, support and career pathways. Conclusions Significant barriers have prevented proliferation of academic roles for experts by experience. Despite barriers, allies have been successful in supporting the implementation and sustaining of positions, and gained considerable expertise, which may be invaluable to academics with similar aspirations. Implications for practice Realization of policy goals regarding service user involvement in mental health services requires health professionals with the will to embrace partnerships. By creating and taking opportunities, allies have developed expertise to facilitate implementation of positions more widely. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Depressive symptoms are highly prevalent among adolescents in Western countries. However, although treatment for depressive symptoms is available, many adolescents do not seek help when they need it. Important barriers to help-seeking among adolescents include low mental health literacy and high stigma. Therefore, we have developed a game-based school program, Moving Stories, which combines mental health literacy training for depression with contact with someone with lived experience both in the digital and nondigital world. Objective: The aim of this study is to conduct a first test of the effectiveness of the newly developed game-based program, Moving Stories, using a cluster randomized controlled trial. Methods: A total of 185 adolescents participated, divided over 10 classes from 4 schools. Half of the classes were randomly selected to follow the Moving Stories program, whereas the other half were in the control group, where no intervention was provided. The adolescents filled out digital questionnaires at 4 time points, with questions on mental health literacy, stigma, depressive symptoms, and the program itself (before the program, after the program, 3-month follow-up, and 6-month follow-up). Using R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing), we ran linear mixed-effects models for all continuous outcome variables and generalized linear mixed-effects models for all binary outcome variables. Results: Compared with the control group, participants in the Moving Stories group improved after the program in personal stigma (b=−0.53, 95% CI −1.02 to −0.03; t<inf>179.16</inf>=−2.08; P=.04). Effects on personal stigma lasted over time (3-month follow-up: b=−0.57, 95% CI −1.11 to −0.03; t<inf>174.39</inf>=−2.07; P=.04). Most adolescents in the Moving Stories group participated in the introduction (97/99, 98%) and contact session (93/99, 94%), played the game for 4 or 5 days (83/99, 83%), and indicated that they would recommend the game to their peers (90/98, 92%). Conclusions: The results of this study show the potential of Moving Stories as a stigma reduction program. With changes in the program to improve its effects on mental health literacy, Moving Stories could be implemented in schools to improve help-seeking in adolescents and reduce the negative consequences and burden of depressive symptoms. ©Anouk Tuijnman, Marloes Kleinjan, Merlijn Olthof, Evert Hoogendoorn, Isabela Granic, Rutger CME Engels.

AB  - Despite rising rates of youth mental health disorders and suicides, most youth lack access to accurate, non-stigmatized mental health information. Instead, many describe people with mental illness as violent and incompetent. Mental health literacy aligns with resilience theory. It assumes that youth that have accurate mental health information will have less stigmatized views of mental illness and will be more likely to seek help earlier should mental health symptoms arise. Accurate, non-stigmatized mental health information is especially needed for Children of a Parent or other Family Member that has a mental illness (COPFMI) since they are more likely to acquire a mental illness than children who do not have a family member with a mental illness. COPFMI youth are in need of the same mental health information as general population youth but they can also benefit from knowing how to deal with a family member's mental health disorder. Based on many foundation studies and key stakeholder input from parents, educators, mental health providers, child welfare providers, and especially youth, an emerging Youth Mental Health Literacy (YMHL) scale was developed and validated for measuring the mental health literacy levels of youth ages 11–14. The scale provides a full scale score of youth mental health literacy. It has subscales of knowledge of mental illness and recovery; stigma, help seeking for self/others; coping with stress; and dealing with family mental health challenges. The validation study indicated support for a unidimensional structure for each of the refined subscales. The subscales showed suitable reliability as evaluated by several measures of internal consistency. While the scale needs further study with larger samples of youth, it is hoped that the scale can yield mental health literacy outcome data that can help mental health literacy programs to build evidence-based programs that may, in turn, help prevent, delay, or ameliorate mental health disorders among youth. © © 2022 Riebschleger, Grové, Kelly and Cavanaugh.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study is to explore the characteristics of the initial sandplay of high school students with poor family function, by studying the initial sandplay of high school students with different levels of family function, so as to provide the basics for the psychological assessment and intervention of high school students. Significance: To provide data support for high school students' mental health education and sandplay therapy, and to apply sandplay as an intervention method to play a healing role in high school mental health work. Methods: High school students (N = 345) were divided into 11 groups and participated in a sandplay experiment for 8 weeks from February to March 2021. Each group completed the Chinese version of the Epstein et al. Family Assessment Device. Samples with scores of one standard deviation below and above the sample mean were placed in the low family functioning group (n = 30; 15 girls) or high family functioning group (n = 30; 15 girls), respectively. The initial sandplay was evaluated on multiple dimensions using an established coding system. Results: Samples with low family functioning used fewer animal figurines in their sandplay (t = 2.176, p < 0.05); had more family scenes (χ2 = 4.356, p < 0.05); fewer rural scenes (χ2 = 4.344, p < 0.05); and fewer healing themes (t = −2.336, p < 0.05). In particular, there were fewer examples of connected healing themes (χ2 = 7.500, p < 0.05); in-depth healing themes (χ2 = 5.455, p < 0.05); and more hindered trauma themes (χ2 = 4.812, p < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis was conducted using the sandplay characteristics as predictors of group membership. Using forward stepwise selection, themes of hindered trauma (B = −2.030) and connected healing (B=1.765) were shown to be significant predictors of group membership (F = 17.784, P < 0.01, ΔR2 = 0.214). Conclusion: Students who reported high and low family functioning showed significant differences in their sandplay characteristics. We propose sandplay characteristics can help identify low family functioning of adolescents during psychological evaluations. © © 2022 Qiu-qiang, Guang-zhi and Qi-zhe.

AB  - Children living in Defence families affected by parental mental illness face increased stressors, pressure for self-sufficiency and potential exposure to adverse outcomes, including future mental illness. Little is known about the impact of mental health early interventions on the help-seeking tendencies of military young people affected by parental mental illness. Similarly, the responsivity of this cohort to peer-based mental health literacy interventions aimed to dispel misconceptions and stigmatising beliefs about mental illness and help-seeking is not well understood. The current study measured key aspects of belief-related mental health knowledge and intentions to seek help from a range of formal and informal sources of 236 Australian young people aged 7–18 years, living with parents affected by military-associated mental health problems. Findings suggest that young people in the Defence community are most likely to seek help from their parents and show changes in beliefs about mental illness and intentions to seek help from some help sources following a brief (2-hour) group intervention. Help-seeking intentions from telephone helplines increased for the cohort, and males were more inclined to seek help from a friend after intervention. Limitations including the absence of a comparison or control group, issues in data measurement protocols and a need for long-term follow-up were future research directions. © 2022, Australian Military Medicine Association.

AB  - The existing literature is reviewed to determine the current state of knowledge about eating disorders (ED), prevention programs in relation to stigma-discrimination, help search, empowerment, emotional education, mental health literacy, and recommending future directions. Preventive interventions, necessary during adolescence and young adulthood, must be designed with the focus on reducing discrimination based on weight and the stigmatization of ED. With some gender specificities, with attention to stress and social isolation, social consensus, EDs in men; with work to reduce compliance with some norms of the male gender, as one of the targets in the development of prevention programs. And reduce teasing by peers and family, experiences of stigmatization with the family and at work, which predict greater internalization of prejudice due to weight (IPP). And carry out mental health literacy activities such as the Media Smart program, promote help seeking, empowerment as in the REBel program and improve emotional education, the management of negative emotions with activities for the improvement of emotions, in addition to the Body Project (cognitive dissonance). © 2022 SENPE y and Arán Ediciones S.L.

AB  - The last few decades have seen an increased interest in ‘Mental Health Literacy (MHL)’ which addresses knowledge and beliefs relating to mental health problems and is likely to hinder treatment-seeking behaviors. Although MHL research to date has explored various mental disorders, far too little attention has been paid to Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) and Problematic Smartphone use (PSU). The objective of this study is to develop an MHL questionnaire for IGD and PSU by adopting the MHL approach in the previous literature and examine MHL of IGD and PSU in Korean teenagers by focusing on their ability to recognize addictions, and perceptions and help-seeking attitudes towards a person with addictions. The current study also aimed to compare Korean teenagers’ MHL depending on low- and high-risk of IGD and PSU. A total of 169 teenagers aged 10 and 16 years were recruited from schools and children’s centers in Seoul and completed the newly developed MHL questionnaire and screening questionnaires for IGD and PSU. The MHL questionnaire for IGD and PSU was designed as a vignette-based questionnaire that depicted behavioral characteristics of a severe problem with Internet and smartphone usage. Korean teenagers had a poor ability to recognize IGD and PSU and were more prone to seek parental help than professional help. The current study also showed that teenagers had better recognition of IGD than PSU and perceived that a person with IGD has a more difficult life than a person with PSU. Furthermore, a low-risk or high-risk group of IGD or PSU showed minimal differences in MHL. The current study provided empirical evidence to support a need to develop educational programs to improve Korean teenagers’ MHL for both IGD and PSU. © 2022 Jeon et al.

AB  - This study aimed to assess adolescents′ Mental Health Literacy (MHL) level, Positive Mental Health (PMH) level, the association between sociodemographic variables and the MHL and PMH levels, and the relationship between adolescent′ s MHL and PMH levels. A quantitative, cross-sectional, correlational study was conducted with a convenience sample of 260 adolescents studying in the 5th to 12th years of school. The Mental Health Knowledge Questionnaire, the Mental Health-Promoting Knowledge, and the Positive Mental Health Questionnaire were used for data collection. Most of the adolescents were female (55.8%) with a mean age of 14.07 years. The participants showed good levels of MHL (MHKQ). The participants showed good levels of MHL (MHKQ x = 60.03; MHPK-10 x = 4.49) and high levels of PMH (x = 128.25). The adolescents with higher levels of MHL were the oldest, in a higher year of school, female, those whose mothers are employed, those who have healthy eating habits, and those who have a better body image self-perception. Adolescents in a lower year of school, with adequate sleep habits, who spend fewer hours a day in front of a screen or online, and who have a better self-perception of mental and physical health and body image were the ones with higher PMH levels. These findings suggest the need to implement experimental or quasi-experimental studies to ascertain the effectiveness of interventions that promote adolescents′ positive mental health literacy. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disability affecting 1 in 44 children nationally. Timely referral to intervention and support services for ASD has consistently demonstrated significant long-term positive effects on symptoms and subsequent skills and family outcomes. This paper highlights a novel and innovative approach of short-term consultations for best practices to ultimately increase access to timely ASD evaluations and support through a state-wide school telehealth initiative. The goal of the initiative was to facilitate rapid access to ASD evaluation and support (within 2 weeks of referral in school-age youth) among under-resourced school systems in Central Texas. First, this paper provides background relative to current disparities that many children face when attempting to obtain ASD evaluations and support. Second, a statewide legislative response is described that created a mental health consortium targeting increased access to broad-based mental health services and supports, particularly in underserved areas. Next, the Texas Child Health Access Through Telemedicine (TCHATT) program is outlined with a particular focus on day-to-day operationality and concentrated efforts to increase mental health literacy among school teams relative to ASD symptoms and co-occurring behavioral health concerns. Year 1 utilization data metrics (September 2020–May 2021) and representative case examples are presented. Finally, early “lessons learned” and future directions are discussed. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Purpose: The study aims to determine the contributions of universal school-based educational programs to the current and future worldwide youth mental health condition. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic search was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Academic education and health databases including ERIC, Education Database, APA PsycInfo, APA PsycArticles, Psychology Database, and PubMed were used. Characteristics and outcomes of educational interventions developed in school settings and education potential for mental health promotion were examined. Findings: Universal school-based mental health educational programs positively affect preadolescents and adolescents. The study review provided further insight into educational programs' characteristics and identified two primary curricula foci: mental health education and development of resiliency traits and skills. Originality/value: Research on mental health promotion using a pedagogical approach is rare as most studies focus on mental health symptomatology and psychotherapy techniques training. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Black adolescent boys experience mental health challenges because of their exposure to a greater frequency and severity of psychosocial stressors. This study used a sample of Black boys at a high school in southeastern Michigan as a case study to understand the types of resources Black boys might use to support their mental health. After conducting a rigorous analysis of the study data using a rapid and an accelerated data reduction technique, four themes helped us answer the question: What kinds of mental health support resources are Black boys using? Four themes emerged from our analysis: Online resources, community and trusted individuals, self-reliance, and additional needs. This case study is a springboard for further work to tailor a mental health education and support intervention, such as the YBMen Project, for Black boys and for building additional support amid the multiple crises occurring that impact their mental health and safety. Findings have implications for future research, practice, and policy to improve the mental health of Black boys in high school. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Eating disorder mental health literacy (ED-MHL) refers to knowledge about the symptoms, causes, and treatment of eating disorders (EDs) and is an important factor in people’s attitudes towards individuals with EDs and help-seeking for EDs. Associations between ED-MHL, stigma, ED symptomatology, and gender were investigated in a sample of N = 194 German high school students. Knowledge and myths about EDs were assessed with 18 factual statements about EDs and agreement/disagreement with common myths about ED. Students also completed the Universal Stigma Scale (USS), the Weight Concerns Scale (WCS), and demographic items. Students judged M = 8.39 (SD = 3.40) statements correctly, while the average agreement with all ED myths was low (M = 0.19, SD = 0.14). Greater ED-MHL was associated with lower stigmatization of EDs. Male participants were less knowledgeable and more likely to agree with the ED myths. Participants displayed moderate ED-MHL; however, certain aspects such as ED risk factors or symptoms of specific disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa were less well known. These results can inform the design of future MHL interventions for adolescents. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Universal screening for postpartum mood and anxiety disorders (PMADs) has been recommended for all new parents at outpatient postpartum and well-child visits. However, parents of newborns admitted to the NICU are rarely able to access these services during their infant’s prolonged hospitalization. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of mental health screening and treatment programs for parents or other primary caregivers in NICUs across the country. In this cross-sectional study, US NICU medical directors were invited to complete an online survey about current practices in mental health education, screening, and treatment for primary caregivers of preterm and ill infants in the NICU. Comparative analyses using Fisher’s exact test were performed to evaluate differences in practices among various NICU practice settings. Survey responses were obtained from 75 out of 700 potential sites (10.7%). Of participating NICUs, less than half routinely provided caregivers with psychoeducation about mental health self-care (n = 35, 47%) or routinely screened caregivers for PPD or other mental health disorders (n = 33, 44%). Nearly one-quarter of the NICUs did not provide any PMAD screening (n = 17, 23%). Despite consensus that postpartum psychosocial care is essential, routine mental health care of primary caregivers in the NICU remains inadequate. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Objective: Mental illness is a common medical condition to onset during adolescence. Young people who leave for postsecondary life are at an especially challenging period of lifetime when many will leave home and familiar environments for prolonged periods of time. These new circumstances may put young people at risk of developing mental health problems or disorders or exacerbate existing mental disorders. Alternatively, some young people may misinterpret the normal negative emotional states occurring as a result of these new challenges as a mental disorder requiring professional intervention. We conducted a quasiexperimental cohort study to investigate the effectiveness of a mental health literacy intervention Transitions with blended life skills to address these challenges for first-year postsecondary students. Methods: Students (n = 2,397) from five Canadian postsecondary institutions were assigned to the intervention or the control group and were administered a survey at baseline, postintervention, and at 2-month follow-up (September 2017 to February 2018). We applied generalized linear mixed effects (PROC Mixed procedure) to test the between-group difference in the post—pre/follow-up—pre and to determine the predicted least-square mean values. Results: The findings showed that students who were exposed to the Transitions intervention significantly improved their mental health knowledge, decreased stigma against mental illness, improved help-seeking attitudes and behaviours, and decreased perceived stress when compared to students who had not been exposed to the intervention. However, we did not identify significant changes in general health. This may be due to the relatively short follow-up time (2 months) to determine participants’ general health status. Conclusions: Transitions delivered to first-year postsecondary students may be a beneficial intervention to help young people adjust to their new postsecondary life and improve their mental health. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Clinical learning experiences are known to exacerbate nursing student anxiety, causing them to present to clinical placement in distressed, meaning anxious, states. Students already living with anxiety are also more likely to suffer setbacks at this time. Supervising Registered Nurses (RNs), in the clinical settings, struggle to support this student cohort. A professional development activity was designed to introduce RNs to higher education and nursing students’ known mental health concerns (such as anxiety) and to arm them with strategies for working with distressed students. A research approach that enabled researchers to collaborate with participants was employed to design the intervention. A study evaluated the impact of the educational intervention with 45 Australian RN supervisors. Two tailed T-tests were chosen to explore the statistical difference between pre- and post-test mean results across the survey items. A 95% confidence interval was used. Statistical significance was set at <0.05. The evaluation indicated the activity could be useful for improving supervising RNs’ mental health literacy, thus enhancing their understanding of how to work with distressed students. Participants recommended the activity be offered to any staff supporting student clinical learning. Collaboration between nursing researchers and nursing clinical staff produced a meaningful professional development activity and motivated the participants to increase their mental health literacy and understanding of strategies to support distressed students. Future projects should adopt similar approaches that would support both RNs’ ability to support students’ during clinical learning and students in distress would also benefit. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - In low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) it is vital to understand acceptable, comprehensive, and culturally appropriate ways of communicating about mental distress. Diagnostic terminology is rarely used, may be stigmatizing, and is subject to misinterpretation. Local terms, such as idioms of distress, can improve mental health literacy and service delivery. Our objective was to examine lived experience and coping connected to distress and depression in an under-researched population: young men from LMIC urban slums. We conducted 60 qualitative interviews with men (ages 18–29) in Bhashantek slum, Bangladesh. Themes were generated using thematic analysis and grounded theory techniques. The heart-mind (mon), mentality (manoshikota), mood (mejaj), head (matha or “brain”), and body (shorir) comprised the self-concept, and were related to sadness, hopelessness, anger, worry, and mental illness. The English word “tension” was the central idiom of distress. “Tension” existed on a continuum, from mild distress or motivational anxiety, to moderate distress including rumination and somatic complaints, to severe psychopathology including anhedonia and suicidality. Respondents connected “tension” to burnout experiences and mental illness which was summarized in an ethnopsychological model. These findings can inform culturally sensitive measurement tools and interventions that are acceptable to the community, potentially increasing engagement and enhancing therapeutic outcomes. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Introduction: Many mental illnesses begin during adolescence. Parents of adolescents need to have sufficient mental health literacy (MHL) to recognize mental health problems in their children and to assist them with help-seeking. Although several educational programs have been developed to enhance parental MHL, their effectiveness has not been established. This study provides a systematic review for the effectiveness of MHL programs in parents of adolescents. Methods: PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC and Web of Science were searched from the earliest date possible until February 2022; references of studies which met eligibility criteria were also screened. Studies that assessed quantitative change in at least one of the following components of parental MHL were included: knowledge of mental health/illnesses; stigma toward people with mental health problems; confidence in helping children with mental health problems, and intention, knowledge or behavior of helping children with mental health problems. Risk of bias (ROB) for each outcome within the included studies was rated using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Nonrandomized Studies for nonrandomized studies. Results: Nine studies (four RCTs, three controlled before-and-after studies, and two case series), reported in 10 articles, were included. Mental health knowledge and/or confidence was significantly improved in several studies, while no studies observed significant improvement in stigma and/or intention/behavior of helping children. ROB was high in five out of nine studies (10 out of 18 outcomes) and unclear in the others. Conclusions: A limited number of studies have evaluated effects of MHL program in parents and inconsistent quality contributes to difficulty in establishing their overall effectiveness. More studies with appropriate methods of recruitment, measurement and analysis, and transparent reporting are needed.

AB  - Problem: One in seven children, aged 3–17, have a mental health diagnosis with suicide being the second leading cause of death in the United States in persons aged 10–24. Adolescents are at high risk for mental health disorders, substance use, and risky behaviors, yet most adolescents never receive treatment. Research is needed to answer the question, “What are adolescents' perceived barriers and facilitators to engaging in mental health treatment?”. Methods: A four-step qualitative meta-synthesis design included: A structured research question and search strategy, data immersion through quality appraisal, thematic synthesis of primary research studies, and reciprocal translation of derived themes. Findings: Eight studies met inclusion criteria. Autonomy was the primary theme that emerged. Meta-synthesis produced five subthemes: (a) choice as integral to engagement, (b) stigma as barrier to engagement, (c) quality of the therapeutic relationship as integral to engagement, (d) systemic influences as both barrier and facilitator to engagement, and (e) mental health literacy as crucial factor in decision to engage. Conclusion: Adolescents require autonomy to engage in mental health treatment. Improving treatment engagement in adolescents requires interventions that address their ability to be autonomous. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Infant mental health is interconnected with and affected by maternal mental health. A mother or birthing person's mental health before and during pregnancy and the postpartum period is essential for a child's development. During the first year of life, infants require emotional attachment and bonding to strive. Perinatal mood disorders are likely to hinder attachment and are associated with an increased risk of adverse mental health effects for children later in life. The Black community is faced with a crisis as Black mothers experience a higher prevalence of perinatal mood disorders, including postpartum depression and anxiety, compared to the United States national estimates. The aim of the research is to identify social, structural, and economic disparities of Black perinatal women and birthing people's experience to understand the impact of perinatal mental health on infants' mental health. Black mothers and birthing people may often face social and structural barriers that limit their opportunity to seek and engage with interventions and treatment that address the root causes of their perinatal mood disorder. To enhance understanding of racial disparities caused by social and structural determinants of health on Black mothers and birthing people's mental health and health care experiences that influence infant mental health, the study team conducted semi-structured interviews among self-identified cisgender Black women health professionals nationwide, who provide care to pregnant or postpartum Black women and birthing people. Our study attempted to identify themes, pathways, interventions, and strategies to promote equitable and anti-racist maternal and infant mental health care. Using a Rigorous and Accelerated Data Reduction (Radar) technique and a deductive qualitative analytic approach it was found that limited access to resources, lack of universal screening and mental health education, and the disjointed healthcare system serves as barriers, contribute to mental health issues, and put Black mothers and birthing people at a disadvantage in autonomous decision making. Our study concluded that instituting education on healthy and culturally appropriate ways to support infant development in parent education programs may support Black parents in establishing healthy attachment and bonds. Prioritizing strategies to improve maternal mental health and centering Black parents in developing these educational parenting programs may optimize parenting experiences. © © 2022 Estriplet, Morgan, Davis, Crear Perry and Matthews.

AB  - Introduction: mental Health Literacy (MHL) encompasses knowledge and beliefs about mental disor-ders, including aspects related to their recognition, management and prevention. Several studies reveal an inadequate level of MHL in the adolescent population, leading to a delay in seeking help. the objective was to assess the level of MHL in a population of adolescents Material and methods: We administered the mental health literacy questionnaire (MHL) to the sample. The statistical analysis was performed with the software SPSS®22.0, using the Student t test (statistical significance p <0.05). Results: we received 179 correctly completed questionnaires, and 24% of respondents reported the presence of mental illness in the family. The mean total score in the MHLq, was 122 points (SD, 8) out of a total maximum of 145 points. When it came to the subscales of the questionnaire, we found a statistically significant lower level of erroneous beliefs/myths about medical illness in female vs male participants (p = 0.02) and respondents who reported mental illness in the family (p = 0.001). Conclusions: MHLq proved to be an easy method for screening MHL. The population under study ex-hibited reasonable knowledge in this area, and the presence of mental illness in the family had a fa-vourable impact on the results. The study highlighted the importance of future interventions for edu-cation and dispelling myths that condition attitudes and prejudices, especially in this age group. © 2022, Spanish Association of Primary Care Pediatrics.

AB  - In recent years, there has been an increase in studies evaluating the effectiveness of mental health literacy programs within the context of education as a universal, preventive intervention. A systematic review and meta-analysis regarding the effectiveness of mental health literacy interventions in schools, from 2013 to the present, on mental health knowledge, stigma, and help-seeking is conducted. Of the 795 identified references, 15 studies met the inclusion criteria. Mental health knowledge increased after the interventions (standardized mean difference: SMD = 0.61; 95% CI (0.05, 0.74)), at two months (SMD = 0.60; 95% CI (0.4, 1.07)) and six months (SMD = 0.39; 95% CI (0.27, 0.51)). No significant differences were observed between stigma and improving help-seeking. Mental health literacy interventions are effective in augmenting mental health knowledge, but not in reducing stigma or improving help-seeking behavior. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Left-behind children (LBC) in China have aroused widespread concern in society and the academic field because they have a high risk of psychological problems. For left-behind children, depression is the most serious problem. Bullying victimization has been evidenced as one of the most common causes of children’s depression. However, less is known about its longitudinal association and the process for how bullying victimization influences depression among left-behind children. Thus, the presentation aims to explore the mechanisms underlying by considering the roles of left-behind children’s negative thoughts and self-compassion. Methods: The 3-wave longitudinal data were collected from a sample of 605 aged 8–11 from central China. We used the Olweus bully and victimization questionnaire, the children’s automatic thoughts scale, the depression scale, and the self-compassion scale. Results: Bullying victimization positively predicted the depression level of left-behind children. Negative thoughts and self-compassion mediate the relationship between bullying victimization and depression. In the mechanism of bullying victimization on depression exists gender differences among left-behind children. Conclusion: The present study suggested the association between bullying victimization and left-behind children’s depression and revealed the internal mechanism of negative thoughts and self-compassion. These findings provide a new perspective for left-behind children’s mental health education and intervention. © © 2022 Yan, Xie, Jiang, Li, Lin and Ding.

AB  - Mental health literacy (MHL) is an established multifaceted concept that comprises mental health knowledge, help-seeking, and stigma. Adequate MHL (i.e., the ability to correctly recognize mental health disorders alongside having the intention to seek help) is able improve mental health outcomes among individuals. This study aims to examine the determinants of MHL among young Malaysian adolescents. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1400 adolescents between 13 and 14 years old from nine national secondary schools in Selangor state, Malaysia. Sociodemographic determinants assessed included gender, age, ethnicity, smoking status, alcohol consumption, history of being bullied, feeling lonely, parental marital status, and parental income which were assessed using the Global School Based Student Health Survey. MHL was assessed using the Mental Health Literacy and Stigma questionnaire. Several factors were significantly associated with adequate levels of MHL following multivariate analysis, such as being female (AOR = 1.68; 95% CI 1.12, 2.52), older adolescents (AOR = 1.56; 95% CI 1.07, 2.30), not smoking (AOR = 1.99; 95% CI 1.20, 4.26), not consuming alcohol (AOR = 1.23; 95% CI 1.18, 2.41), and not feeling lonely (AOR = 1.25; 95% CI 1.06, 1.85). Addressing these determinants could be key in assisting the development of policies and programs to prevent mental health disorders among adolescents, which are currently on the rise. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The training undergraduate nursing students receive, both in terms of theoretical input and clinical practice, may help to instil a less stigmatising perception of mental health. To analyse the perceived evolution of attitudes and expected behaviours, a longitudinal repeated measures study was conducted in a population of student nurses during their undergraduate mental health education. The Mental Illness: Clinicians’ Attitudes Scale, a Scale for measuring attitudes to the mentally ill among future Health workers, and the Reported and Intended Behaviour Scale were completed. A mixed linear model was used to assess the effect of each factor in the questionnaires before and after the various stages of the students’ training in mental health. The overall effect of each factor was assessed by testing the interaction between factor and group, both with and without adjustment with the Social Desirability Scale. The results showed that the clinical practice stage, due to the proximity to care for people with mental health problems, improves attitudes and behaviours towards mental health in students who have not had mental health problems, and also in younger students. In conclusion, integrated, holistic training during the period of clinical practice was associated with positive changes in the attitudes and intended behaviour. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background: The present study aims to determine the reliability and validity of the Positive Mental Health Literacy Scale in the Turkish language. Methods: The sample of the present methodological study included 457 adolescents. The data were collected between February 10, 2019, and May 31, 2019, with a sociodemographic data form and the Positive Mental Health Literacy Scale. The scale was first translated to the Turkish language, expert opinion was obtained, and a pilot scheme was conducted. The content validity index was employed to test the validity of the scale, confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses were conducted to test the construct validity, item analysis was conducted to test the reliability of the scale, Cronbach’s alpha analysis was employed to determine internal consistency, and the test–retest scores were compared to determine time invariance. Results: The scale is unidimensional. The content validity analysis of the scale was 0.97. Scale item loads varied between 0.56 and 0.72 based on the confirmatory factor analysis. The Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of the scale was 0.87, and the test–retest score was intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.739 (P <. 001). The mean participant score on the positive mental health literacy scale was 2.9 (SD=0.9). Conclusion: The validity and reliability findings in the study that was conducted to adapt the Positive Mental Health Literacy Scale to the Turkish language revealed that the scale could be used to measure the mental health literacy of adolescents. The Turkish version of the scale could be used in programs that aim to identify positive mental health literacy levels of adolescents in Turkish society. © Author(s).

AB  - Background: Optimising mental health literacy (MHL) at the individual and population level can be an effective mental health improvement and prevention tool. However, concepts of MHL are largely based on evidence from high-income countries. Little is known about the manifestation and role of MHL in countries where collectivist health and social cultures are dominant. Aim This study aimed to examine the MHL of Indonesian children and young people (CYP) with experience of common mental health problems and their parents. Methods: Semi-structured interviews with 40 participants (19 CYP aged 11-15 with experience of common mental health problems and 21 parents) from three areas of Java, Indonesia. Data were analysed using framework analysis, informed by Jorm's 1997 Mental Health Literacy Framework. Results: Parents and CYP demonstrated relatively low levels of MHL defined from a conventional perspective. Religiosity and spirituality were salient in participants' accounts, particularly parents, as were narratives about personal responsibility. These beliefs appeared to contribute to a high level of self-blame for mental illness, self-reliance for symptom management, the foregrounding of support from spiritual/traditional healers and a reduced propensity to access professional help. CYP were heavily reliant on family support, but parents often felt they were not best placed to communicate with their children about mental health. Providing trusted, technology-based sources of mental health information were advocated by CYP. Conclusion: Robust efforts are needed to improve MHL in low- and middle-income countries drawing on culturally appropriate approaches to reduce stigma and optimise timely, effective help-seeking for CYP. Enhancing parental and family level literacy may be efficacious, especially when combined with mechanisms to facilitate open communication, as may the development of standalone interventions directly developed to reach younger generations. Future research may usefully establish the comparative efficacy and acceptability of these different approaches. © © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Unmet mental health needs among children in the United States (U.S.) are at a critical status (Kimball & Miller, 2015; Perou et al., 2013), with less than half of children receiving needed care (Whitney & Peterson, 2019). Unmet mental health needs are especially pronounced for racial/ethnic minority children, including Black/African American children (Alegria et al., 2010; Cokley et al., 2014), whose rates of suicide among those aged 5–11 years has increased in the past two decades (Bridge et al., 2015). Culturally responsive strategies that build on common mental health help-seeking pathways for Black/African American families are needed to improve access to care. The Bridging the Gap pilot project described in this paper used an innovative lay health worker model embedded in faith-based networks to target child mental health stigma and promote professional help-seeking among 65 Black/African American parents of children 5–12 years old. A single-group, pretest, posttest, follow-up (PPF) design (with double pretest and double follow-up) was used to structure the delivery of the pilot program and data collection. Child mental health stigma significantly decreased after the intervention portion of the program but help-seeking attitudes stayed constant. Thirteen parents had children with clinically significant mental health needs. Of the eight parents reached for follow-up, five sought child mental health services based on individualized recommendations and the rest endorsed intentions to follow through on service recommendations. Parents endorsed satisfaction with the program and several program evaluation themes were identified through qualitative data.

AB  - This paper addresses the question of mental health, in particular the manner in which it finds its way into education. Increased attention to mental health in education should be welcomed, but often the focus is on ‘problem-solving’, which in turn confines the ‘solution’ within the spectrum of preventive and corrective intervention. Often it is the term ‘mental health’ itself that leads us to think of it, by analogy to physical health, as a kind of goal to be achieved, a recovery and recuperation—that is, something to be effectively aided and fixed. But I suggest that if there is any way that education can attend to children's mental health, it is rather by holding itself back from problem-solving. Then, other than considering the ‘problem’ as an object of inquiry or introspection, attention can be turned towards the contextuality of human experience and what I shall call its fundamentally wounded condition. Hence, a shifting in the conception of the problem. I take the film Shoplifters as a starting point—that is, as a site where we can attend to the particularities of reality and the specificities of experience. Towards the end, it will become clearer how film can direct us to an alternative way to attend to mental health in education. © 2022 The Philosophy of Education Society of Great Britain.

AB  - Background: Many children with mental health problems do not receive professional help. Despite the frequent use of digital health interventions (DHIs) such as websites or web-based service navigation platforms, their effects on parents’ mental health literacy, help seeking, or uptake of professional services are unclear. Objective: This study aims to provide a systematic review and narrative synthesis to describe whether DHIs improve the aforementioned parental outcomes. Methods: Databases, including CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE OVID, PsycINFO, and PubMed (2000-2020), were accessed. Studies were included if they evaluated quantitative changes in mental health literacy, help seeking, or the uptake of services by parents of children with mental health problems. Theoretical frameworks, sample sizes, participant demographics, recruitment, interventions, DHI use, results, and health economic measures were used for data extraction. Results: Of the 11,379 search results, 5 (0.04%) studies met the inclusion criteria. One randomized controlled trial found the reduced uptake of services after using a DHI coupled with a telephone coach for a child’s behavioral problem. Of 3 studies, 2 (66.7%) found statistically significant improvement in mental health literacy for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder but had no control group. One study found nonsignificant improvement in mental health literacy and help-seeking attitudes toward anxiety and depression compared with those in active controls. All studies were rated as having a high or serious risk of bias. Search results were affected because of a single reviewer screening articles, overall low-quality studies, and a lack of consistent nomenclature. Conclusions: There is no high-quality evidence that DHIs can improve parents’ mental health literacy, help seeking, or uptake of services. More research is needed to evaluate DHIs by using rigorous study designs and consistent measures. ©Daniel Peyton, Marquelle Goods, Harriet Hiscock.

AB  - Refugee children are less likely than their non-refugee peers to receive timely diagnoses and treatment for mental and/or behavioral health problems, despite facing multiple risk factors including potential exposure to trauma during premigration, migration, and postmigration experiences. Social–Emotional Learning offers preventive mental health education for children through well-established, evidenced-based curricula. Although there are clear benefits of Social–Emotional Learning curricula, which can help children achieve long-term success emotionally and academically, Social–Emotional Learning curricula are not easily accessible for refugee children, often because of language and socioeconomic barriers. In this pilot study, we evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of an adapted Social–Emotional Learning program that included culturally specific, multilingual, trauma-informed wellness, and physical education during the COVID-19 pandemic: EMPOWER (Emotions Program Outside the Clinic With Wellness Education for Refugees). We used the Intervention Mapping framework which guided the (1) planning, (2) program development, and (3) mixed-method evaluation of the feasibility and acceptability of the EMPOWER pilot. We found that this adaptation was well-received by Afghan refugee families and that COVID-19 safety measures were well-understood after participation. Challenges emerged around videoconferencing connectivity and around finding a common language for discussing emotions. Future iterations of the program and evaluations will require continued partnerships with community members and organizations. As we continue and expand EMPOWER, we aim to evaluate short-term improvement in Social–Emotional Learning competence as well as long-term mental and behavioral health outcomes for children and their families. © 2021 Society for Public Health Education.

AB  - Purpose: Early detection of eating disorders (EDs) could improve their prognosis, decrease morbidity and mortality, and prevent the risk of evolution towards a chronic form and somatic, psychiatric and psychosocial complications. The objective of this review was to examine the current scientific data concerning the early detection of EDs, which is one of the facets of secondary prevention. Method: A scoping literature review was carried out following the PRISMA-ScR criteria, including all articles on ED detection published up to 2021 on PUBMED and PSYCINFO. Results: 43 articles were included. Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa were the most widely studied disorders. The articles focused on professionals from the medical field (GPs, psychiatrists, gynaecologists, gastroenterologists and residents), from the paramedical field, from education and sport, and from the general population. The assessments conducted with the professionals receiving interventions aiming to improve detection demonstrated their efficacy. Interventions for ED detection in the general population and at school seemed less efficacious. Conclusion: The results highlighted some lines of action to be implemented. They pointed towards improving initial and continuing education for professional carers; e-learning could be an interesting solution for continuing education. Improving training with specific instructors, school personnel and sports professionals is also one of the solutions for a better detection of EDs. Specific recommendations could be published for fitness centre professionals to help them to deal with clients suspected of having an ED. Among secondary school students and in the general population, a better dissemination of mental health literacy and the development of mental health first aid programs could help improve early detection.

AB  - Objective: This article describes survey results from child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) fellowship program directors regarding attitudes of their programs’ capacity to effectively educate fellows on the social determinants of mental health and program directors’ perceived importance of doing so. Methods: A survey asking about six topics within the social determinants of mental health was disseminated to all CAP program directors with email addresses found in the Fellowship and Residency Electronic Interactive Database (FREIDA) (n = 134). Data were exported using the Qualtrics survey platform. Results: Fifty-three program directors (40%) responded to the survey. Overall, 98% of program directors felt education on the social determinants of mental health was “essential” for fellowship training, but there were significant differences in perceived relative importance and effectiveness of education provided across topics. Familial factors were rated as significantly more important than structural, historical, and economic factors. Structural and historical factors were viewed as being taught less effectively than other factors. Educational, structural, and historical factors and neighborhood factors were allotted significantly less instructional time than familial factors. Conclusions: While there is near-universal consensus that social determinants of mental health education are critical for fellowship training, program directors feel that social determinants of mental health topics differ in importance and are taught at varying levels of effectiveness. These findings highlight the need for intra-institutional and or inter-institutional collaboration for social determinants of mental health educational content development if CAP programs are to prepare trainees to best serve their most vulnerable patients. © 2020, Academic Psychiatry.

AB  - Children witness various degrees and intensities of violations and violence along with a hoard of environmental stressors. Such a spectrum of violence includes disturbing family environments, witnessing adults, including parents and family members, indulge in violence and abusive behaviours and direct or vicarious exposure to violence outside the home. The chapter aims to provide an overview of the nature and impact of witnessing violence. The frequency, type, intensity and the child's relationship with the people involved or impacted by the violence can determine the impact on a child's mental health and development. Children may witness distressing events in their daily lives like the loss of a loved one or watching adults take up challenging tasks, which may help them be resilient and learn coping skills with appropriate support. Long-term exposure to witnessing violence and trauma can lead to severe emotional and developmental difficulties. Such direct or vicarious exposure to varying degrees of violence may cultivate a culture of fear, repression and silence around the children. These difficulties may be similar to those of children who are direct victims of abuse. Witnessing violence has also been linked to anxiety and depression. Children growing up in such environments are at higher risk of normalizing violence and growing into abusive adults. Poverty, cultural factors, parenting, schooling, and policies can largely determine such risks for children. The paper discusses the preventive and promotive approaches at the school, family and community levels. Education and empowerment of adults in the child's environment can be the best preventative approach. Existing policies and programmes in India for children need to bring in more robust initiatives to identify, report, prevent and protect children witnessing violence. The needs and concerns of children witnessing violence and prevention approaches should be part of courses in helping professionals training and curriculum. The chapter calls for the necessity of individual and community-based interventions in terms of need-based models for addressing the mental health needs of children. The chapter strongly recommends the need for addressing mental health education for families and schools. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since the 1950s, mental health care in Japan has been hospital-centered. A set of legislative initiatives were undertaken in 1995, emphasizing the importance of community-based mental health care. However, despite these attempts to develop a community-based mental health care system, the rate of inpatient-based treatment has remained high and the shift from hospital-centered care to community-based has still not fully materialized. AIM: This study aims to conduct a review of the available literature on the development of community-based mental health care in Japan between 2010 and 2020. METHODS: We conducted a standardized literature search in the electronic database Igaku Chuo Zasshi, aiming to identify original studies published between 2010 and 2020 that explored community mental health care in Japan. The included studies’ outcomes were categorized as performance surveys, service user reports, service provider reports, and educational activities. A descriptive-analytical method was implemented in the current review. RESULTS: A total of 25 studies were examined. Six studies reported surveys assessing the performance of community-based mental health care on the assertive community treatment (ACT), compulsory treatment, home-visit nursing care, physical complications, and a welfare medicine collaboration on a remote islands. Four studies investigated the perspectives of service users or their families on home-visit nursing care, social participation, community program, and legislative revision. Ten studies focused on social withdrawal, service providers perspectives on local population needs, supporting skills, care programs, and the professional growth of psychiatric social workers. Five studies focused on educational approaches for future healthcare professionals and efforts to improve mental health literacy among adolescents. CONCLUSION: This paper provided the first comprehensive review of Japan’s community-based mental health care. Between 2010 and 2020, community mental health care in Japan evolved in many directions, with the understanding that various needs should be met. Home-visit nursing care and ACT can be considered as the most thoroughly investigated and better developed. Research that adopt rigorous methodologies such as randomized controlled trials is required if the goal is to achieve solid conclusions. © 2022, Eco-Vector LLC. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Delivery of mental health interventions to youth in schools requires a cadre of community mental health workers (CMHWs) in addition to psychiatrists. Literature is sparse in the India context on the ethical and professional challenges faced by CMHWs, especially those working with youth. Hence, the aim of the study was to understand these challenges faced by CMHWs working in schools in urban Chennai and explore ways to overcome them. Methods: A qualitative study was done with CMHWs involved in the delivery of youth mental health (YMH) interventions, including mental health literacy, screening for mental disorders and mental health support to youth in schools in urban Chennai. Focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with the study participants and audio recorded. Transcription of the recording was done verbatim and coded for themes using a thematic analysis approach. Results: Two FGDs were conducted with a total of eight participants. The mean (± standard deviation) age of the participants was 27 ± 3.7 years; all having a master’s degree in either psychology, social work, or public health. The major themes that emerged were the meaning of ethics and professionalism, confidentiality, dilemma in decision making, incongruence between the requirements of student and school administration, and personal and professional challenges faced by CMHWs. Recommendations to overcome these challenges were also explored. Conclusion: The results indicate CMHWs face significant ethical challenges with confidentiality, and decision making while delivering YMH interventions in schools, highlighting the need for designing and implementing a framework to address these challenges. © Indian Journal of Medical Ethics 2022.

AB  - Background: At present, mental health education has become a key issue in education. Because many young students have more or less certain negative psychological emotions, these emotions seriously affect the physical and mental health of young students. China began to carry out mental health education for students in the 1980s, and now has accumulated a lot of valuable teaching experience, but the research on the mental health problems of minority students is very few. Some studies show that there are significant differences in the comparison of negative psychological problems among ethnic minority students. Generally, the mental health level of Han students is higher than that of ethnic minority students. Nowadays, the development of society is faster and faster, and people are more and more competitive in life. As the hope of the country in the future, teenagers’ mental health problems are bound to receive special attention. Subjects and methods: In this study, 380 primary and secondary school students in a city were selected by random sampling, including 120 minority students and 320 Han students. After all subjects were randomly divided into groups, both experimental group and control group included 130 Han students and 60 minority students. The experimental group was given singing combined with health education mode teaching, and the control group was given routine teaching. Before and after teaching, the two groups were evaluated with the scales related to depression, alienation and well-being, and the differences in the scores of ethnic minority students were analyzed. Results: In the increment of negative emotion, the increment of students’ negative emotion score in the experimental group is significantly lower than that in the control group. The main effect of participating in the experiment is significant, and the national main effect is not significant. Whether to accept music teaching or not has no significant interaction effect with nationality. The incremental differences of self-efficacy, somatization and interpersonal problems were not significant. In the lack of emotion, the main effect of participating in the experiment is significant, and the national main effect is not significant. After chorus teaching, there was no difference in the increment of the total score of loneliness between the two groups. The main effect of participating in the experiment was not significant, and the national main effect was not significant. There is no significant interaction between acceptance of chorus teaching and nationality. Conclusions: Chorus course can effectively promote the mental health level of ethnic minority primary school students, especially in reducing depression, improving happiness and the love of music courses. © Medicinska naklada - Zagreb, Croatia.

AB  - In recent years, with the acceleration of urbanization and the implementation of compulsory education, the pressure on students' study and life has increased, and the phenomenon of psychological and behavioral problems has become increasingly prominent. Therefore, the school has regarded students' mental health education as the top priority in teaching work. Effective expression classification can assist psychology researchers to study psychology and other disciplines and analyze children's psychological activities and mental states by classifying expressions, thereby reducing the occurrence of psychological behavior problems. Most of the current mainstream methods focus on the exploration of text explicit features and the optimization of representation models, and few works pay attention to deeper language expressions. Metaphors, as language expressions often used in daily life, are closely related to an individual's emotion, cognition, and psychological state. This paper studies children's smiling face recognition based on deep neural network. In order to obtain a better identification effect of mental health problems of children, this paper attempts to use multisource data, including consumption data, access control data, network logs, and grade data, and proposes a multisource data-based mental health problem identification algorithm. The main research focus is feature extraction, trying to use one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) to mine students' online patterns from online behavior sequences, calculate abnormal scores based on students' consumption data in the cafeteria, and describe the dietary differences among students. At the same time, this paper uses the students' psychological state data provided by the psychological center as a label to improve the deficiencies caused by the questionnaire. This paper uses the training set to train five common classification algorithms, evaluates them through the validation set, and selects the best classifier as our algorithm and uses it to identify students with mental health problems in the test set. The experimental results show that precision reaches 0.68, recall reaches 0.56, and F1-measure reaches 0.67. © 2022 Guangyan Yang.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to provide a group music therapy intervention for elementary and middle school students with mood disorders through music therapy. To explore the improvement of group music therapy on the dysphoria and state of adolescent patients with mood disorders and to explore the relationship with self-identity. A music activity-based mental health education curriculum was designed based on the results of the current survey, while two homogenous classes were selected as the experimental and control classes; subsequently, the experimental teaching of the music activity-based mental health education curriculum was conducted in the experimental class, and the regular school mental health education curriculum was conducted in the control class, and the pre- and postexperimental scale tests were used to analyze that the curriculum of this study had a positive effect of this study's curriculum on elementary school students' positive emotions analyzed through pre- and postexperimental scale tests. The music activity-based mental health education program had a significant positive effect on the overall level of positive emotions of elementary school students, especially in the positive emotion index, happiness index, mental toughness, goal focus, and interpersonal assistance factor. The positive psychology-oriented music activity-based mental health education curriculum is well suited for elementary and middle school students, especially for upper elementary and middle school students. The music activity-based mental health education curriculum realizes the value of applying positive psychology to mental health education efforts at the elementary school level and flexibly uses a variety of related theories to promote positive emotional experiences for elementary and middle school students. © 2022 Dong Li.

AB  - Mental illness stigma is a significant barrier to utilizing mental health services for young populations. Few studies have evaluated how specific stigma dimensions relate to help-seeking and recommendations among adolescents. We examined how the stigma dimensions of labeling, stereotypes, and separation/discrimination influenced self-reported help-seeking behaviors of adolescents and recommendations for hypothetical peers with a mental health problem. Longitudinal data (four assessments) from a study evaluating the effectiveness of three antistigma interventions (curriculum, contact, materials, vs. control) among adolescents were analyzed (n = 396). Help-seeking outcomes comprised services in formal (e.g., doctor), informal (e.g., friend), or school-based (e.g., school counselor) settings. Generalized estimating equations tested associations of labeling, stereotypes, and separation/discrimination on help-seeking for a personal problem and recommendations for vignette characters described as having bipolar depression or social anxiety disorder. Adolescents were more likely to make help-seeking recommendations for peers with mental health problems than they were to seek help for a problem of their own. Labeling was a strong predictor of selfreported help-seeking and recommendations. Mental health literacy, an indicator for low negative stereotypes, was related to increased recommendations but not self-reported help-seeking. Positive stigma action and awareness—high cognizance of stigma and how to engage in proactive behaviors toward treating and destigmatizing mental illness—increased help-seeking in formal and informal settings for oneself. Finally, separation/discrimination did not prevent self-reported help-seeking, but it did increase peer recommendations in certain settings. Stigma did not always influence or interfere with help-seeking in the same way when the help-seeker was oneself versus a peer. © 2022. American Psychological Association

AB  - Medical students have been shown to be vulnerable to mental stress. Strengthening individual protective characteristics can be one cornerstone for promoting medical students’ mental health and thereby preventing mental disorders. Online programs are an opportunity to provide appropriate options that have the advantage of being accessible from anywhere, at any time, and with a low entry threshold. This review provides a literature overview of current online programs for medical students. The findings can serve as a point of reference for designing effective online programs for mental health-promotion and mental disorder-prevention in medical curricula. We applied a systematic literature search in PubMed, ERIC, Cochrane, and Web of Science. Programs offered had to be web-based, and the addressed group had to be medical students. Protective individual characteristics for mental health and information on the programs’ effectiveness were included in the search. As outcomes, we included mental health, burnout, symptoms of depression, anxiety, and well-being. The search yielded 723 articles; of them, 11 met the inclusion criteria. Programs found were grouped according to their focus: mental health literacy, mindfulness, based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or peer support. Two studies showed significant reductions in perceived stress; one study indicated reduced burnout levels. One program had significant immediate effects on mindfulness, empathy, and resilience; two studies indicated strengthening coping strategies. Two programs were qualitatively assessed as helpful; two studies are ongoing. Nine studies lacked control groups; two randomized controlled trials were ongoing. Only a few online programs with limited evidence of effectiveness were found. They addressed protective individual characteristics, highlighting their importance for mental health. Thus, more health-promoting and mental disorder-preventing programs with high-quality effectiveness studies are necessary. An integration of such programs into curricula would allow for greater utilization and could give greater emphasis to and prioritize mental health in medical education. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Objectives. Mental Health Literacy (MHL) is an important factor in promoting mental health. Assessing this structure is required for early recognition and intervention in mental health problems. To date, there was no tool to assess it among Iranian adolescents, so this study was aimed at examining the psychometric properties of the Persian version of the Adolescent Mental Health Literacy Questionnaire (AMHLQ) among Iranian female students. Method. The study instrument was a Persian version of the AMHLQ prepared through a translation and back-translation process. In this cross-sectional study, 275 female students completed the AMHLQ, and the Adolescent Strengths, and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Results. Findings of content, construct validity tests, Cronbach's alpha, and split-half coefficient demonstrated that the AMHLQ had satisfactory validity and suitable reliability. The exploratory factor analysis showed four dimensions of the AMHLQ: (1) knowledge of mental health problems (α=0.89); (2) erroneous beliefs/stereotypes (α=0.89); (3) help-seeking and first aid skills (α=0.86); and (4) self-help strategies (α=0.74). Conclusion. The findings showed that the tool was confirmed by questions and subscales, and this questionnaire was a valid and reliable tool in assessing level differences of MHL and in determining the impact of programs designed to improve MHL in Iranian female adolescents. © 2022 Somayeh Zare et al.

AB  - Purpose: Globally, adolescent mental health problems reportedly manifest more severely in individuals with lower mental health literacy. Mental health curriculum interventions using social media have been associated with positive implementation outcomes. This study aimed to investigate whether such an intervention significantly improves adolescent mental health literacy and is associated with positive implementation outcome measures. Methods: This study employed a quasi-experimental design, comparing the before-and-after difference between the intervention group (n<inf>1</inf>=77) and the control group (n<inf>1</inf>=76). A mental health literacy module was delivered using social media. Data were collected using validated questionnaires. Effect size and difference-in-differences model calculations (and associated 95% confidence intervals, CI) were conducted alongside other descriptive analyses. Results: The estimated intervention effect size and difference-in-differences estimates were greater than zero. The effect was greater in the intervention than in the control group (p<0.05) despite sex and age differences. The effect size estimate provided by Cohen’s d and Hedges’ g values was medium-to-large (d/g=0.429–0.767, p<0.05). The difference-in-differences reflected a significant effect (DID=0.348, CI: 0.154–0.542, p<0.001) in increasing mental health literacy despite differences associated with sex, age, and school grade. The intervention program was acceptable, appropriate, feasible, and satisfactory, and more than 80% of participants said they agree to completely agree with these implementation outcomes. Resources and personal and family-related factors were among the perceived influencing factors determining the effectiveness and implementation outcome measures. Conclusion: The intervention program effectively improved the mental health literacy of adolescents. It has been highlighted that social media interventions for mental health promotion could be practical and scalable; however, there is a need to take into account socio-demographic differences and barriers to inclusion/compliance. © 2022 Hassen et al.

AB  - As adolescence is considered a critical period for preventing mental health issues in adulthood, adolescents became the primary audience of public health campaigns aimed at promoting mental health literacy. Despite empirical consistency on the effectiveness of face-to-face mental health literacy programs for adolescents, little is known about the characteristics and effects of technology-mediated interventions for this goal. This systematic review seeks to systematize the empirical knowledge on the effects of technology-mediated programs promoting mental health literacy among adolescents. We conducted a systematic literature search until December 2019 and selected four empirical studies that evaluated the effects of these types of programs on different mental health indicators. Results show that technology-mediated programs had positive effects on increasing mental health literacy, with gender and age moderating these associations. Their effect on reducing stigma and prompting professional help-seeking behavior, however, was inconsistent. The limitations of the studies included in the review were also discussed. © 2022, UNIV SAOPAULO. All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite high rates of mental health challenges, Asian Americans are less likely to seek out and receive school-based mental health services (SBMHSs) than their non-Asian peers. The Youth Mental Health First Aid (YMHFA) training is an 8-hr manualized public education program designed to educate adults on recognizing common mental health challenges among adolescents and intervening. However, no published research has evaluated YMHFA among Asian Americans.We culturally adapted YMHFA for Asian Americans (Asian American parents and youth workers) and used a pretest/posttest design to evaluate its effectiveness. Specifically, we (a) added one 2-hr session before the YMHFA to augment engagement with the curriculum and (b) contextualized the YMHFA curriculum content to ensure cultural sensitivity for Asian American participants. Thirty-one Asian immigrant parents (M<inf>age</inf> = 45.55, SD = 3.6) and 24 Asian American youth workers (M<inf>age</inf> = 23.17, SD = 3.67) participated in YMHFA. Participants’ mental health literacy (MHL) and their confidence in using MHFA skills significantly increased after the training. Participants also participated in four focus groups after the training to share their experiences. Participants stated that they benefited from this training and suggested additional cultural adaptations to make the program more appropriate for Asian Americans. Culturally adapted YMHFA may be an effective way to promote MHL and engage Asian Americans in mental health services. © 2021. American Psychological Association

AB  - Latinos encounter structural and cultural barriers that hinder their ability to access mental health services, often turning to faith-based organizations for support. This grounded theory study aimed to analyze the impact of a faith-based mental health literacy program on Latino mental health. Qualitative interviews were used to generate data and results were evaluated through social constructivism and intersectionality lenses. Findings demonstrated that the impact of the program extended past the individual level to the family and community level, ultimately enhancing mental health literacy, improving parenting practices, breaking intergenerational stigma, and promoting engagement with formal mental health services. © 2022 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Autism, a developmental disorder affecting social and communication skills, differs from most the mental handicap in showing a characteristic pattern of poor, intact, and even superior cognitive abilities. This study aims to solve the mismatch of the teaching content and mental health education for autistic children. Inspired by artificial intelligence, an improved neural network matrix factorization (NeuMF) model is designed based on the theory of collaborative filtering, and time data is added to improve the NeuMF by using the K-means clustering algorithm. Several evaluation indexes such as root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are selected to assess the performance of the proposed model. Results show that RMSE and MAE of the improved NeuMF model are 1.251 and 0.625, respectively, which are better than collaborative filtering and traditional neural network factorization models. Moreover, the proposed model is used to recommend the activities of physical education (PE) for developing the intelligence of autistic children. This proves that the optimized model has better performance and can be used to recommend online courses for autistic users. This dynamic personalized curriculum recommendations model can help autistic children recover in a short time. © 2022 Hongzhong Hao and Sheng Hu.

AB  - Objective Perinatal depression is linked to poor maternal health and infant development outcomes. The World Health Organization recommends expanding the mental health education and training of primary care providers to improve the quality of perinatal depression care. The present study evaluated the effect of various psychological training methods on nurses’ and midwives’ competence in administering care to and alleviating symptoms in patients with perinatal depression. Methods A comprehensive search of the PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases was performed. The data were independently extracted by two reviewers, and the critical appraisal tools of the Joanna Briggs Institute were used for quality assessment. Random-effects meta-analysis was conducted using Review Manager 5.4 software. Findings A total of 13 articles including 246 nurses and midwives and 4,381 perinatal women were reviewed. Care administered through both face-to-face (relative risk [RR] 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61–0.74) and digital training (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26–0.74) significantly mitigated symptoms of perinatal depression. Significant benefits were observed after 3- to 5-day and 8-day training, for which the RR were 0.75 (95% CI 0.59–0.97) and 0.72 (95% CI 0.66–0.85), respectively. Studies with high intervention fidelity more effectively reduced the risk of depressive symptoms in perinatal women than those with low intervention fidelity. Key conclusions and implications for practice Compared with face-to-face, digital training methods were more effective in reducing the risk of depressive symptoms. High intervention fidelity and 3- to 5-day and 8-day training resulted in better outcomes. The present findings can serve as a reference for the design of psychological training programs for nurses and midwives to equip them with effective strategies for administering care to patients with perinatal depression. © 2021

AB  - Background and aims: The purpose of this study was to investigate the attitudes toward eating disorders in native German adolescents (Germans), adolescents with Turkish migration background in Germany (Immigrants), and native Turkish adolescents (Turks). Method: A total of 507 adolescents (N = 139 Germans; N = 126 Immigrants; N = 242 Turks) read a vignette describing a 16-year-old female with bulimic symptoms. Participants completed questionnaires on mental health literacy, stigmatization, desirability of eating disorder-related behaviors and acquaintance with bulimic symptoms. Results: Adolescents living in Germany were more likely to recognize the vignette as an eating disorder than Turks. Immigrants were more similar to Germans in mental health literacy of eating disorders than Turks. However, in terms of stigmatizing attitudes, immigrants blamed more than Germans, Turks being intermediate on this variable. In Turks, higher desirability of eating disorder-related behaviors was associated with an increased acquaintance with bulimic symptoms and decreased evaluations of impairment. Higher mental health literacy was associated with less blame in Germans. Conclusions: Migration background was associated with increased mental health literacy of eating disorders but did not result in reduced stigma. Differences in attitudes toward eating disorders indicate the need for differential interventions across the groups. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Aims: This study explored how adult children perceived family resilience, barriers to develop family resilience and how cultural values influence their experience of parents with bipolar disorder in Chinese society. Design: A qualitative design with an interpretive phenomenological analysis of data was employed. Methods: Twenty adults who had lived with parents with bipolar disorder during childhood were recruited from the acute psychiatric ward when their parents were admitted to the hospital. They described their experiences of perceived family resilience and barriers to resilience (October 2013–September 2015). Semi-structured interviews were conducted in the hospital meeting room or at a convenient location. Findings: Six themes were identified in family resilience: ill parents try to be good parents, parents’ personal strengths, parents’ positive attitudes towards mental illness, flexibility of family role, cohesive relationships between family members, and families’ social connections. Three themes were identified in the barriers to develop family resilience: poor parenting/family function, conflict between parents and poor mental health literacy. Conclusion: Children's views of family resilience could transform their suffering from lived experiences with a mentally ill parent to a positive growth experience. Family resilience includes well and ill parents’ efforts and social network's help to maintain family function. However, the conflicts between well and ill parents and poor family function result in a traumatic growth experience. Impact: To enhance a positive growth experience, family resilience programs for a parent with bipolar disorder aiming to cultivate both the ill and well parents’ inner strength and their competence of parenting skills with connecting their social network to maintain family function is needed. Moreover, early stress-reduction intervention needs to be developed for children who did not experience family resilience. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Adolescents with a diagnosable mental health disorder must often first disclose their mental health problems to a parent in order to obtain professional mental health treatment. The decision to disclose private, personal health information is the result of successful progression through disclosure decision-making processes fraught with barriers that can discourage disclosure; therefore, the current study explored adolescents’ perceptions of factors that facilitate or discourage disclosure of mental health information to parents. Thematic analysis of a series of focus groups with adolescents with and without a mental health disorder discovered several themes that describe factors adolescents consider in the disclosure decision-making process. Several identified themes are consistent with past research related to health-related disclosure decisions, but some themes suggest that the mental health disclosure decision-making processes of adolescents may be different than the decision-making processes of adults in other health contexts. Results of the study have implications for interventions associated with adolescents’ and parents’ mental health literacy, mental health stigma and communication about mental health issues. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Objectives: This study aims to provide a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature on the long-term effects of interventions addressing children’s and adolescents’ mental health literacy and/or stigmatizing attitudes. Methods: Articles in English or German published between January 1997 and May 2020 were retrieved from five databases, leading to a total of 4,375 original articles identified. Results: 25 studies were included after applying exclusion criteria, 13 of which were eligible for meta-analysis. The overall average of the follow-up period was about 5 months. Long-term improvements were sustained for mental health literacy, d = 0.48, 95% CI = (0.34, 0.62), as well as for stigmatizing attitudes, d = 0.30, 95% CI = (0.24, 0.36), and social distance, d = 0.16, 95% CI = (0.03, 0.29). The combination of educational and contact components within interventions led to worse results for mental health literacy, but not stigmatizing attitudes or social distance. Conclusion: Interventions targeting children and adolescents generally have a brief follow-up period of an average of 5 months. They show a stable improvement in mental health literacy, but are to a lesser degree able to destigmatize mental illness or improve social distance. © © 2021 Freţian, Graf, Kirchhoff, Glinphratum, Bollweg, Sauzet and Bauer.

AB  - Conceptual frameworks for school-based, preventive interventions recognise that educators' capacity is, in part, dependent on school-level characteristics. This study aimed to (i) examine the factor structure and internal consistency of the Mental Health Literacy and Capacity Survey for Educators (MHLCSE); (ii) assess responses in relation to supporting students' mental health; (iii) describe schools' mental health provision in terms of designated roles, training offered, and perceived barriers; (iv) investigate variance in MHLCSE outcomes explained by schools; and, (v) explore school-level predictors of educators' perceived MHL and capacity after controlling for individual-level characteristics. A multi-level, cross-sectional design involving 710 educators across 248 schools in England was used, and secondary analyses of baseline data collected as part of the Education for Wellbeing Programme were conducted. Mental health provision data was available for 206 schools, of which 95% offered training to some staff, and 71% had a designated mental health lead. Secondary schools offered significantly more training than primary schools. Significant barriers included lack of capacity in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) and within school, and communication challenges between agencies. The amount of training offered by schools significantly predicted educators' awareness and knowledge of mental health issues, treatments and services, legislation and processes for supporting students' mental health and comfort providing active support, with increased training predicting higher scores. However, little variance was explained by schools (1.7-12.1%) and school-level variables (0.7-1.2%). Results are discussed in relation to current mental health and education policy in England. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press.

AB  - Background: Adolescence is a crucial period for the acquisition of good mental health behaviours, which are the foundation for health and wellbeing in later life. Improved knowledge about mental health and improved help-seeking behaviours have been shown to lead to better mental health outcomes. Mental health literacy (MHL) is multifaceted (e.g., knowledge about symptoms, the stigma around mental health, good mental health practices, etc.). Measures are needed that can assess these different aspects of MHL. Measurement of mental health literacy is currently limited due to a lack of reported psychometric instruments with known psychometric properties. Given that most mental health problems start in early adolescence, a scale is needed that is reliable and valid in this age group. Methods: The development and validation of the psychometric instrument (termed the Knowledge and Attitudes to Mental Health Scales: KAMHS) entailed two phases: 1) item generation based on an evidence-based intervention programme: The Guide; and 2) item reduction through exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) for factor structure and psychometric assessment. Participants were 559 Year 9 pupils in secondary schools across Wales aged between 13 and 14 years. Results: Results from the CFA indicated an acceptable fit of the model to the data. The KAMHS showed good internal constancy and moderate test-retest validity (.40–.64). Conclusions: The final version of the KAMHS contains 50 items that are appropriate for use in children and adolescents. These results suggest that the KAMHS can be used over time to assess the efficacy of interventions aimed at increasing the mental health literacy of adolescent populations. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The purpose of this study was to describe demographic, toxicological, criminal, and medicolegal characteristics of suicides of young people aged up to 24 years examined by the Porto Alegre Medicolegal Office, from 2010 to 2016. This cross-sectional study collected data from the Porto Alegre Medicolegal Office and the Rio Grande do Sul State Police Department. The information was obtained from death certificates, toxicological analyses and police reports. Rates were calculated according to sex and age range (under 15 years old, 15 to 19 years old, and 20 to 24 years old) for comparing local with national data. There were 143 people who died by suicide in the period, 120 males and 23 females. Hanging was the most frequently used method, but in the range of 10 to 14 years old, firearm use was the predominant method. Fifty percent of male victims and 30% of female victims had some criminal history. Suicide rates in the study groups generally followed national trends. The relative frequency of suicide by firearm in this study diverged from international findings, as it was relatively more frequent in children under 15 years old and less frequent in older ranges. If confirmed, the finding draws attention to access to firearms in this age range. In older age ranges, adolescents and young adults were frequently involved in the criminal system. This finding may be useful for planning interventions involving both mental health education and screening for problems that may be associated with criminal involvement. © 2021, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Emotional disorders in young people are increasing but studies have found that this age group do not always recognise the signs and symptoms of mental health problems in themselves or others. The Mental Health Foundation’s school-based Peer Education Project (PEP) has the potential to improve young people’s understanding of their own mental health at a critical developmental stage (early adolescence) using a peer teaching method. This study is a process evaluation to understand: the mechanisms through which PEP might improve young people’s mental health literacy, any challenges with delivery, how the project can be embedded within wider school life and how it can be improved to be of most benefit to the widest number of young people. We will also validate a bespoke mental health literacy questionnaire, and test the feasibility of using it to measure outcomes in preparation for a future study evaluating effectiveness. Methods: All schools recruited to the study will receive the PEP intervention. The process evaluation will be informed by realist evaluation approaches to build understanding regarding key mechanisms of change and the impact of different school contexts. The evaluation will test and revise an existing intervention logic model which has been developed in partnership with the Mental Health Foundation. Process evaluation data will be collected from newly recruited schools (n = 4) as well as current PEP user schools (n = 2) including training and lesson delivery observations, staff interviews and student focus groups. Baseline and follow-up data will be collected in all newly recruited intervention schools (n = 4) from all students in Year 7/8 (who receive the PEP) and recruited peer educators in Year 12 via a self-report survey. Discussion: This study will enable us to refine the logic model underpinning the peer education project and identify areas of the intervention that can be improved. Findings will also inform the design of a future effectiveness study which will test out the extent to which PEP improves mental health literacy. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Youth amateur sporting environments present an untapped, under-researched, and potentially vital avenue for targeted mental health intervention programs. This study evaluates such an intervention in 12 sporting clubs, comprising of 330 Australian youth aged 12–15 years (M = 13.73, SD = 0.79). Mental health literacy, help-seeking intentions, and help-seeking behaviors were measured throughout the season using a repeated-measures experimental-control design. Multilevel modelling revealed the intervention successfully improved mental health literacy and help-seeking intentions in particular cohorts, such as youth scoring low in these constructs pre-intervention and youth who had not previously received the intervention. This study demonstrates the efficacy of interventions to effect positive change in amateur sporting youth, highlighting a convenient method to improve mental health in young people. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Mental illness accounts for 16% of the global burden of disease and injury for young people. Mental health literacy (MHL) and action refers to mental health knowledge, where to seek help, and ways to promote positive mental health. There are promising outcomes and effectiveness from youth MHL and action programs in promoting positive mental health and reducing mental illness stigma. Evaluation of such programs in Australia are scarce. This paper outlines the protocol to implement a mental health literacy and action program, called Youth Education and Support (YES) program, in Australian secondary schools using a cluster controlled trial. Students across grades seven to ten will be recruited via their school and allocated to the intervention (YES program). Individuals will be recruited via advertisements for a control group. Measures include the Youth Mental Health Literacy scale (YMHL), General Help Seeking Questionnaire (GHSQ), Actual Help Seeking Questionnaire (AHSQ), and 14-Item Resilience Scale (RS-14). Qualitative questionnaires, and a fidelity instrument will also be used to assess the YES program. Measurements for the YES program will be taken for pre (before program), post (final session of program), three months, and one year follow up timepoints. The YES program has been evaluated in a pre-post study in the USA which demonstrated desirable outcomes for increasing MHL among youth. Health education within the Australian curriculum does not wholly include MHL and action, therefore programs such as YES need to be implemented and evaluated to address the mental health needs of youth.

AB  - Background: Migrant communities are often underserved by mainstream mental health services resulting in high rates of untreated psychological distress. This collaborative study built on evidence that mindfulness-based interventions delivered in-language and culturally tailored were acceptable and clinically effective for Arabic speakers in Australia. It aimed to establish whether a group mindfulness program produced expected outcomes under normal operational conditions, and to test its scalability and its transferability to Bangla speakers. Methods: A 5-week mindfulness program was delivered to 15 Arabic-speaking and 8 Bangla-speaking groups in community settings. The mixed-methods evaluation incorporated a pre-post study. Descriptive statistics were used to summarise the socio-demographic data, group attendance and home practice. Differences in DASS 21 and K10 scores from pre to post-intervention were tested using the nonparametric sign test for paired samples (two-sided). Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to determine the effects of selected sociodemographic variables, group attendance and home practice on clinical outcomes, based on intention to treat. Content analysis was used to examine the qualitative data. Results: The program attracted 168 Arabic speakers and 103 Bangla speakers aged 16 years and over, mostly women. Cultural acceptability was evident in the overall 80% completion rate, with 78% of Arabic speakers and 84% of Bangla speakers retained. Both language groups showed clinically and statistically significant improvements in mental health outcomes on the DASS21 and K10. Thirty new referrals were made to mental health services. Participant feedback emphasised the benefits for their everyday lives. All but one participant reported sharing the mindfulness skills with others. Conclusions: Across multiple and diverse groups of Arabic and Bangla speakers in Sydney, the community-based group mindfulness program was shown to have high levels of cultural acceptability and relevance. It resulted in clinically and statistically significant improvements in mental health outcomes, facilitated access to mental health care and boosted mental health literacy. This innovative, low-intensity, in-language mental health intervention that was originally developed for Arabic speakers is scalable. It is also transferable—with cultural tailoring—to Bangla speakers. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - What is known on the subject?: An important step towards improving mental health outcomes is the realignment of tertiary mental health education and research in a way which places strategic value on experience-driven involvement in mental health and addiction-related care. One of the most widely recognized ways of achieving this is by increasing representation of individuals with first-hand experience of mental health and addiction distress (also known or referred to as Experts by Experience or EBE) within the tertiary sector. What this paper adds to existing knowledge?: Benefits of tertiary EBE representation such as improving student's preparedness for practice and the empowerment of mental health consumers are consistently reported throughout the literature. In striving towards these outcomes, it is crucial we remain mindful of relevant and often-reported hurdles such as stigma and improper implementation. By using Aotearoa New Zealand as a case study, the need for approaches to increasing EBE representation which is conscious of diverse cultural contexts, perspectives and identities is highlighted. What are the implications for practice?: This review draws together a broad range of factors associated with improving clinical practice. These include the potential for EBE representation to improve outcomes for trainee clinicians, and the incorporation of consumer-driven perspectives into evidence-based practice. This review further highlights the need for EBE representation to be implemented in a way which is responsive to the cultural needs and nuances of mental health education and practice in Aotearoa New Zealand, and, similarly in other countries. Abstract: Introduction There is potential value in increasing representation of expert by experience (EBE) involvement in mental health education sectors. This approach to improving mental health outcomes is here explored in the context of Aotearoa New Zealand's tertiary education sector. Aim/Question This review sought to identify potential outcomes, benefits and barriers associated with EBE representation in tertiary institutions, whilst critically analysing these strategies in the context of Aotearoa New Zealand's mental health education sector. Method Data retrieved from electronic databases were subjected to critical appraisal and thematic analysis. The integrative review drew from a final data set of 113 articles. Results An integrative review of our search results indicated that moving towards a tertiary mental health model in which lived experience plays a central role has the potential to benefit both teaching and research in the tertiary sector. Discussion The interplay between contemporary perspectives on tertiary EBE representation and the cultural needs and nuances of Aotearoa New Zealand's tertiary sector highlights the need for critical and careful approaches to EBE representation. Implications for clinical practice Findings surrounding tertiary EBE representation have direct implications for the training of mental health practitioners and the evaluation and development of clinical practice outcomes and procedures. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Background: HIV affects many adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) in South Africa. Given the bi-directional HIV and mental health relationship, mental health services may help prevent and treat HIV in this population. We therefore examined the association between common mental disorders (CMD) and HIV-related behaviours and service utilisation, in the context of implementation of the combination DREAMS (Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored and Safe) HIV prevention programme in rural uMkhanyakude district, KwaZulu-Natal. DREAMS involved delivering a package of multiple interventions in a single area to address multiple sources of HIV risk for AGYW. Methods: We analysed baseline data from an age-stratified, representative cohort of 13–22 year-old AGYW. We measured DREAMS uptake as a count of the number of individual-level or community-based interventions each participant received in the last 12 months. CMD was measured using the validated Shona Symptom Questionnaire, with a cut off score ≥ 9 indicating probable CMD. HIV status was ascertained through home-based serotesting. We used logistic regression to estimate the association between CMD and HIV status adjusting for socio-demographics and behaviours. Results: Probable CMD prevalence among the 2184 respondents was 22.2%, increasing steadily from 10.1% among 13 year-old girls to 33.1% among 22 year-old women. AGYW were more likely to report probable CMD if they tested positive for HIV (odds ratio vs. test negative: 1.88, 95% confidence interval: 1.40–2.53). After adjusting for socio-demographics and behaviours, there was evidence that probable CMD was more prevalent among respondents who reported using multiple healthcare-related DREAMS interventions. Conclusion: We found high prevalence of probable CMD among AGYW in rural South Africa, but it was only associated with HIV serostatus when not controlling for HIV acquisition risk factors. Our findings highlight that improving mental health service access for AGYW at high risk for HIV acquisition might protect them. Interventions already reaching AGYW with CMD, such as DREAMS, can be used to deliver mental health services to reduce both CMD and HIV risks. There is a need to integrate mental health education into existing HIV prevention programmes in school and communities. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Aim: The onset of mental illness is most common in adolescence, therefore mental health promotion efforts frequently target this age group. Evaluation literature in this area is largely segmented into specific domains in terms of settings, countries, and/or groups of young people, but an overall understanding and comparison across these areas is lacking. The current review aims to provide such an overview of interventions/programs which attempt to improve adolescents' mental health literacy, attitudes/stigma and behaviours. Methods: A systematic mapping review synthesized the strengths and weaknesses of published interventions/programs to improve mental health outcomes in youth. Ten databases and grey literature sources were searched, and results were categorized according to sample, location/setting, type of information presented, delivery and testing procedures, mental health outcome/s evaluated, and limitations. Results: One hundred and forty articles met the inclusion criteria; 126 were original records and 14 were reviews. Mental health literacy and attitudes/stigma were examined most frequently, and studies were predominantly conducted in school-based environments and high income economies. Intervention/program effectiveness varied across outcome/s measured, setting, and control group usage, with mental health literacy exhibiting the most positive changes overall. Common limitations included no long-term follow up or control group inclusion. Conclusions: Despite generally positive changes seen throughout studies in this area, effectiveness differed across a range of methodological domains. Most research is conducted in schools and higher income economies, but the lack of investigation in other contexts (i.e., internet or community) or lower income countries suggests our understanding in this area is constrained. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd

AB  - Mental health disorders are common and have a significantly negative impact on the health and well-being of women. For example, perinatal mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression are widely understood to be the most common complications of pregnancy and childbirth. Untreated mental health disorders are associated with significant obstetrical and psychiatric sequelae and have a long-lasting impact on neonatal and childhood outcomes. As front-line providers for women during times of elevated risk of psychiatric morbidity, such as pregnancy and postpartum, obstetricians and gynecologists are compelled to have familiarity with such disorders. Yet, a wide gap exists between the level of education in mental health disorders that obstetrician and gynecologist providers receive and the clinical need thereof. The objectives of this commentary are to describe the urgent need for mental health education for obstetricians and gynecologists providers and to introduce our vision for a concise, evidence-based and accessible set of digital educational materials designed to convey core concepts in women's reproductive mental health. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background Simulated patients (SPs) in mental health nursing education provide a unique approach to assist student development in complex assessment skills. Purpose The purpose of this international multisite study was to evaluate the use of two diverse mental health SP simulation scenarios on nursing students' satisfaction and self-confidence in learning to care for patients with mental health disorders in the United States (n = 70) and Turkey (n = 90). Methods A multisite cross-sectional study design was used. Outcome measures included the Student Satisfaction and Self-confidence in Learning Scale and the adapted Simulation Effectiveness Tool-Modified. Results were analyzed using independent t tests. Results While students in the United States reported higher perceived self-confidence and satisfaction in learning, both student populations found the intervention effective to their learning (P <.05). Conclusion Using SPs in mental health education allow students to practice their assessment skills learned in classroom and transfer them to the clinical area. © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Background Stigma and limited mental health literacy impede adolescents getting the help they need for depressive symptoms. A serious game coupled with a classroom session led by lived experience workers (LEWs) might help to overcome these barriers. The school-based Strong Teens and Resilient Minds (STORM) preventive program employed this strategy and offered a serious game, Moving Stories. The current study was carried out to assess inhibiting and promoting factors for scaling up Moving Stories once its effectiveness has been ascertained. Methods Moving Stories was offered in three steps: (1) introductory classroom session, (2) students playing the game for five days, (3) debriefing classroom session led by lived experience worker. Data was collected on the number of participating students, costs of offering Moving Stories, and was further based on the notes of the debriefing sessions to check if mental health first aid (MHFA) strategies were addressed. Results Moving Stories was offered in seven high-schools. Coverage was moderate with 982 participating students out of 1880 (52%). Most participating students (83%) played the Moving Stories app three out of the five days. Qualitative data showed that the MHFAs were discussed in all debriefing sessions. Students showed great interest in lived experience workers' stories and shared their own experiences with depression. Conclusions Bringing Moving Stories to scale in the high-school setting appears feasible, but will remain logistically somewhat challenging. Future implementation and scale-up of Moving Stories could benefit from improved selection and training of LEWs that played such an important role in grabbing the full attention of students and were able to launch frank discussions about depressive disorder and stigma in classrooms. © 2021 Gijzen et al.

AB  - Objective: Recognizing the status of mental health literacy among women and girls as effective and key individuals in family and society seem to be essential. Therefore, the present study was conducted to evaluate depression literacy among women and girls in Tehran on prevention and effective interventions for improving depression. Method: This study was part of a large mental health literacy project on residents of Tehran in 2017, with a sample size of 1023 girls and women aged 16-68 years. Random Digit Dialing (RDD) sampling was done using the Australian questionnaire, whose Persian version's validity and reliability was tested in our previous study. Data were analyzed by SPSS 21 software. In order to determine the effect of demographic variables on predicting depression literacy among participants, multiple regression analysis was performed. Results: Receiving counseling, relaxation training, having physical activity, and studying self-help books were the most helpful items, respectively, from the participations' point of view. More than 70% of participants agreed with avoiding stressful situations and close relationship with family and friends, while only 49.8% agreed with coping skills learning. Based on the regression analysis, only higher education and the history of exposure to a person with similar Vignette problem were able to predict mental health literacy in the area of intervention and prevention. Conclusion: Considering the effects of women's and girls' depression on individual, family, and even social life, more attention should be paid to improve depression literacy in this group. © © 2021 Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

AB  - Although there is substantial evidence for the merits of integrating social and emotional learning (SEL) into educational settings, little empirical research on this learning approach has been conducted in Mainland China. We synthesized the frameworks of Western SEL and the guidelines of Chinese mental health education, and conducted a preliminary assessment of a short-term SEL curriculum that we designed and piloted in an elementary school. We randomly assigned two classes comprising 111 fifth-grade students to take the SEL curriculum (intervention group), and compared them with a third class comprising 53 fifth-grade students assigned the usual curriculum (control group). The results show that the intervention group had a significant increase in emotional intelligence scores after completing the activities in the curriculum, and the control group experienced an increase in feelings of competitiveness. Students in the intervention group generally perceived the SEL curriculum as striking the right balance between enjoyable activities and valuable learning. Our findings imply that it would be a positive educational development to design SEL curricula for systematic use across multiple grades, thus weaving these into the formal Chinese elementary school system. © 2021 Scientific Journal Publishers Limited.

AB  - Background: Given the relatively high prevalence of mental disorders among adolescents, improvement of the mental health literacy of adolescents is of particular importance for the prevention and treatment of these disorders. The purpose of this study was to identify the inhibiting factors affecting mental health literacy from the perspective of adolescents. Methods: Twenty-four adolescents aged 15-18 years old participated in this study. The participants were recruited from secondary schools located in Tehran by using purposive sampling. The data which were collected by semi-structured interviews, were then analysed via the conventional content analysis approach. Results: Three themes were identified as inhibiting factors in improving mental health literacy in adolescents. They were individual attitudes and beliefs, socio-cultural and familial factors, and knowledge about mental health issues. Conclusions: Prior to planning, applying, and implementing comprehensive programs to improve mental health literacy among community members, especially adolescents, it would be helpful to consider the factors that are effective in providing services. © 2021, Indian Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.

AB  - Background and objective: Considering the worldwide increase in mental health problems among adolescents and the hypothetical positive impact of mental health literacy (MHL) on mental health promotive behaviours, this study examined the effect of a MHL intervention in a sample of Iranian high school students. Design: Educational intervention with a pretest–posttest and control group design conducted among Iranian high school students in 2019. Setting: Four public schools in Shiraz, Iran. Methods: In this study, 220 students (110 in each intervention and control group) were selected using the cluster multi-stage sampling and participated in the study. Participants completed the adolescent MHL questionnaire at two stages (pretest and posttest). A training programme which comprised six 60- to 90-minutes sessions using collaborative learning techniques and printed materials was conducted with the experimental group. Data were subjected to covariance analysis. Results: No significant differences were found between study groups regarding demographic and MHL scores before the intervention. After completing the training programme, the intervention group showed a significant improvement in MHL and subscale scores (p <.01). Covariance analysis confirmed an improvement of MHL in the intervention group after controlling for pretest scores but not in the control group. Conclusion: Study findings demonstrated the efficacy of the training intervention to improve adolescents’ MHL. Further research is recommended to examine the effects of the same intervention among boys and longer-term outcomes. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Purpose of Review: The training of psychiatrists and other mental health professionals requires education on a range of interpersonal, communication, and psychotherapy techniques. Classroom and workshop training must be augmented by experiential learning with feedback for skill implementation with fidelity. Virtual standardized patients (VSPs) are computerized conversational agents that can support experiential learning through standardized, consequence-free training environments at reduced costs. Recent Findings: Research on mental health VSPs is rife with feasibility and acceptability pilot studies across various training populations and settings. Users have generally reported positive reactions to training with VSPs, though frustrations with some VSP speech recognition or VSP response relevance has been reported. Several studies have demonstrated a promising transfer of clinical skills from VSP training to human standardized patients and randomized trials supporting improved skill relative to reading or academic study are encouraging. Summary: As technology improves and natural language processing and accurate computer response generation for broad ranging conversational topics emerges, the field would benefit from research on the characteristics of effective VSPs for a range of purposes and trainee populations. Well-designed randomized evaluations of VSPs relative to best practices in education are needed, particularly regarding the impact of VSPs on clinical practice among actual patients. © 2021, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to understand adolescent males' experience of participating in a sports-based mental health literacy intervention (Help Out a Mate), and provide insight into their perceptions of the effectiveness and implementation of the program. Method: Thirty-three adolescent males (12–15 years old) who had recently participated in Help Out a Mate took part in six focus groups. Inductive thematic analysis was used to analyse focus group data, and a number of strategies were employed to enhance the trustworthiness of this account, including peer debrief, grounding in examples, and prolonged engagement. Results: These data indicated that these adolescent males broadly had a positive experience of Help Out a Mate and reported that the program was effective in terms of mental health literacy outcomes including increased knowledge of mental health, and increased confidence and intentions to seek and provide help. Delivering the program in the context of sport was reported as engaging, and preferable to delivery in a school context. Whilst some adolescents reported reductions in stigmatising attitudes following the program, others expressed a maintenance of these attitudes, suggesting addressing stigma remains a challenge for mental health literacy workshops. Further, adolescents reported that the program could be improved by including more practical activities and better group management by facilitators. Conclusions: These findings identify important insights into adolescent males' perspectives of the effectiveness and importance of Help Out A Mate as a sports-based mental health literacy intervention, and suggest a number of strategies for improving participation and engagement. © 2021

AB  - Objective: Law enforcement officers often have contact to persons who show symptoms of mental disorders. Adequately designed training is necessary for developing the best possible practices in policing when coming into contact with mentally ill people, and may help to expand their general knowledge on mental disorders. To achieve a sustainable implementation of training content in daily policing work, the acceptance and proactive integration of methods by the training participants is essential. Method: This study investigates an exemplary modular training curriculum based on a survey with 2,228 German police officers (28.2% female, 71.8% male) concerning their needs and challenges when coming into contact with persons with mental disorders. This empirical end-user driven approach was used to adapt existing training concepts to the current needs and interests of law enforcement personnel in order to maximize compliance. Results: The training program draft includes basic modules which are intended to be of direct interest to all police officers, such as mental disorders with high policing relevance, encountering suicidal patients, (non-directive) communication and de-escalation skills, and mental hygiene in policing. They are arranged in more specialized modules that address specific target group audiences within police forces and the training curriculum provides information about genuine risks and self-protection, trauma sensitivity, and interaction with children and victims among other contents. The self-selectable, modular, and empirically-based continued training program also includes an introduction to local mental health service professionals and networks, trialogue sequences, and situational role play scenarios. Conclusion: Due to frequent contact law enforcement officers have to mentally ill people, improved training designed to maximize knowledge and the integration of trained methods is necessary. Gaining acceptance and proactive support by trainees is ensured through end-user driven implementation of specialized and differentiated up-to-date training programs. Our results showcase how police officers' perspectives on persons with mental illnesses is a main aspect that can and should be used to encourage training course designs. © Copyright © 2021 Lorey and Fegert.

AB  - This mixed-method research addresses two problems: 1) the need to understand more deeply the lived experiences of individuals with mental illness to inform the design of a virtual serious game (VSG) and; 2) the need for more accessible and interactive mental health VSGs for nursing student learning before attending community placements. We began with an Ontario-wide collection of individual narratives about living with mental illness using qualitative methods and then applied the findings in two ways. First, we incorporated the person-centered feedback into the serious VSGs' storyline, and secondly, we developed and refined the VSG prototype. Next, we will implement the VSG into the nursing curriculum for evaluation of learning outcomes. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Safety isolation protocols in response to the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic have had the unintended consequence of social isolation for adolescents, youth who have a developmental need for autonomy and peer connection. Social isolation alone can lead to various psychological effects such as anxiety, stress, low mood, fear, frustration, and boredom. School nurses serve a vital role in addressing stress among adolescents by initiating early interventions, ensuring positive school experiences for students, and providing support surrounding the development of mental health disorders. Through implementation of NASN’s Framework for 21st Century School Nursing Practice, school nurses address stress among high school students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Innovative interventions can include recognizing signs and symptoms of stress on physical and emotional health, advocating for mental health literacy curriculums, social prescribing, incorporating anticipatory guidance related to health promotion lifestyle practices into each school health encounter, and creating a virtual school health office to reach students while COVID-19 safety isolation continues. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Secondary schools have attempted to address gaps in help-seeking for mental health problems with little success. This trial evaluated the effectiveness of a universal web-based service (Smooth Sailing) for improving help-seeking intentions for mental health problems and other related outcomes among students. Methods: A cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the 12-week outcomes of the Smooth Sailing service among 1841 students from 22 secondary schools in New South Wales, Australia. Assignment was conducted at the school level. The control condition received school-as-usual. The primary outcome was help-seeking intentions for general mental health problems at 12-weeks post-baseline. Secondary outcomes included help-seeking behaviour, anxiety and depressive symptoms, psychological distress, psychological barriers to help-seeking, and mental health literacy. Data were analysed using mixed linear models. This trial was registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12618001539224). Findings: At 12-weeks post-baseline, there was a marginal statistical difference in the relative means of help-seeking intentions (effect size=0•10, 95%CI: -0•02–0•21) that favoured the intervention condition. Help-seeking from adults declined in both conditions. There was a greater reduction in the number of students who “needed support for their mental health but were not seeking help” in the intervention condition (OR: 2•08, 95%CI: 1•72–2.27, P<•0001). No other universal effects were found. Participants found the service easy to use and understand; However, low motivation, time, forgetfulness, and lack of perceived need were barriers to use. Interpretation: Smooth Sailing led to small improvements in help-seeking intentions. Refinements are needed to improve its effectiveness on other mental health outcomes and to increase student uptake and engagement. Funding: HSBC and Graf Foundation. © 2021

AB  - This was a Mental Health Literacy (MHL) study looking at three disorders, part of a systematic research programme on MHL using vignette methodology to examine lay people’s knowledge and recognition. The study compared the recognition of the disorders in children and adults. In all 485 participants, aged 18–69 years, read three vignettes describing a person with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and Conduct Disorder (CD). Vignette characters were described as either a child (aged 8yrs) or adult (aged 28 yrs). Participants attempted to label the disorder and then rated perceived seriousness and likelihood of disorder. Results from a 2 (sex) × 3 (disorder) way analysis of variance showed that CD was significantly perceived as the most serious disorder. ADHD was significantly considered more likely to be a disorder in adults yet recognised more in children. Younger participants correctly recognised ADHD, yet gave lower seriousness ratings. ASD was considered more serious in children. Women and highly educated individuals perceived ASD more seriously and recognised it more. Parents incorrectly identified CD but considered all disorders more seriously than non-parents. Clinical behaviours are more likely to be perceived as a disorder if they occur in adults, rather than children. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Seeking help for mental health concerns is critical for improving wellbeing and preventing the development of mental health disorders, yet many adolescents with mental health problems fail to seek professional help. It is well established that young people with mental health problems face a variety of barriers to help-seeking; however, little is known about the ways in which these barriers interact to impact upon the help-seeking process. Guided by the reasoned action approach, this study investigated the predictive relationship between factors that influence help-seeking. Results revealed that mental health knowledge significantly predicted help-seeking intentions, while attitudes did not. Gender differences were identified for help source preferences. The current study contributes to knowledge on the relationship between key variables that influence the adolescent help-seeking process. Findings highlight the importance of mental health knowledge in predicting help-seeking intentions and provide support for interventions that focus on improving mental health literacy in adolescents. ©

AB  - Objectives To evaluate the quality of adolescent mental health service provision globally, according to the WHO Global Standards of adolescent mental health literacy, appropriate package of services and provider competencies. Design and data sources Systematic review of 5 databases, and screening of eligible articles, from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2020. Study eligibility criteria We focused on quantitative and mixed-method studies that evaluated adolescent mental health literacy, appropriate package of services and provider competencies in mental health services, and that targeted depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder among adolescents (10-19 years). This included adolescents exposed to interventions or strategies within mental health services. Study appraisal and synthesis methods Study quality was assessed using the National Institutes for Health Study Quality Assessment Tools. Data were extracted and grouped based on WHO quality Standards. Results Of the 20 104 studies identified, 20 articles were included. The majority of studies came from high-income countries, with one from a low-income country. Most of the studies did not conceptualise quality. Results found that an online decision aid was evaluated to increase adolescent mental health literacy. Studies that targeted an appropriate package of services evaluated the quality of engagement between the therapist and adolescent, patient-centred communication, mental health service use, linkages to mental health services, health facility culture and intensive community treatment. Provider competencies focused on studies that evaluated confidence in managing and referring adolescents, collaboration between health facility levels, evidence-based practices and technology use. Conclusions and implications There is limited evidence on quality measures in adolescent mental health services (as conforms to the WHO Global Standards), pointing to a global evidence gap for adolescent mental health services. There are several challenges to overcome, including a need to develop consensus on quality and methods to measure quality in mental health settings. PROSPERO registration number CRD42020161318. ©

AB  - Perinatal psychological distress (PPD) may cause delays in help-seeking in the perinatal period, which is crucial for families with small children. Help-seeking theories focus on rational processes of behavior wherein ‘help-seeking’ is viewed as a decision-making process, in which action is preceded by recognizing a problem. We identified the phase prior to actual help-seeking actions as a life situation and a phenomenon through which to gain a deeper understanding from women’s own perspectives. The aim of this study was to integrate and synthesize knowledge of women’s experiences of contemplating seeking help for PPD. We chose interpretative meta-ethnography by Noblit and Hare (1988) and implemented eMERGe guidelines in reporting. The search was performed systematically, and the 14 included studies were evaluated with Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist (CASP). We identified seven themes and a metaphor in a lines-of-argument synthesis, showing that contemplating help-seeking is a multidimensional phenomenon. We did not observe a straightforward and linear process (as previous research suggests) but instead a complex process of contemplating help-seeking. A clinical implication is that service providers should work with outreach and develop their tools to connect with mothers with PPD. Another suggestion is to improve training in mental health literacy prior to or during pregnancy. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Parenting in the digital age has been characterized as one of the most challenging tasks of the modern era. Parents are ambivalent about their mediating role. However, problematic aspects of adolescent online use have not been adequately addressed in education. The present study investigated parental perceptions of intervention needs within schools to prevent excessive/problematic use, enhance parent–child communication, and reduce family conflicts. Nine interviews with parents of adolescents residing in the UK were carried out and analyzed utilizing thematic analysis. Three main themes emerged as parental proposals: (i) schools as digital education providers and prevention hubs, (ii) provision of mental health literacy to raise awareness, resolve ambiguity regarding impacts and mitigate excessive use and impacts, and (iii) psychoeducation and upskilling. The third theme related to impacts from time spent on screens (time displacement), content-related impacts, and context-related impacts. The present study offers recommendations for media literacy during adolescence beyond e-safety (i.e., addressing interpersonal communication problems, privacy vs. disclosure issues), based on parents’ views, and provides new insights for media and emotional health literacy collaboration efforts. Future work should investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of such interventions to support the emotional health of young people and prevent problematic internet use escalation. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - This article debates the impact of the pandemic lockdown on the mental health of children and young people. It proposes that children and young people have been subject to the kind of psychological distress that has featured as the folk syndrome, cabin fever. Drawing on the evidence about the impact of prolonged confinement and isolation on mental health, not least in penal and spaceflight contexts, the article points to a long tail of mental health challenges for children and young people through and in the wake of the pandemic. Finally, the article summarizes some of the antidotes for cabin fever and new, exciting, creative digital interventions that may assist upstream mental health literacy and complement and support the work of child and adolescent mental health services. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Film-based interventions have been embraced by adolescents as educational tools, but their efficacy in mental health education remains under-explored. In this review, we systematically examined the use of film-based interventions in adolescent mental health education. A systematic review of the empirical literature was conducted using the following databases: Academic Search Complete, Education Full Text [H.W. Wilson], CINAHL Plus with Full Text, Humanities Full Text [H.W. Wilson], MEDLINE, APA PsycArticles, APA PsycInfo, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, Social Sciences Full Text [H.W. Wilson], Soc Index, ERIC. Risk of Bias were assessed using Version 2 of the Cochrane RoB tool for randomised trials (RoB2) or the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias In Non-randomised Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I). Ten peer-reviewed studies were included in this review. Film emerged as a promising education method for enhancing metal health literacy and reducing stigma. Mixed reports were found for improving attitudes towards help-seeking, with narrative-based films having a weaker effect on attitudes towards help-seeking when compared with more instructive approaches. No study focussed on resilience. This review highlights the utility and potential for film-based interventions in adolescent mental health education. Further research is warranted around how best to implement such interventions to engage adolescents. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Introduction A subgroup of adolescent and young adult childhood cancer survivors (AYACCS) are at increased risk of psychological distress. Despite this, AYACCS experience difficulties accessing psychological support. E-mental health (e-MH) may offer a solution to reduce this treatment gap. However, research examining e-MH for AYACCS has experienced difficulties with recruitment, retention and adherence. Such difficulties may relate to: (1) help-seeking behaviour and/or (2) e-MH acceptability. The overall study aims are to: (1) examine potential associations between health service use factors, informed by Andersen's behavioural model of health services use, and help-seeking behaviour; (2) examine attitudes towards e-MH interventions; and (3) explore perceived need for mental health support; past experience of receiving mental health support; preferences for support; and barriers and facilitators to help-seeking. Methods and analysis An online and paper-based cross-sectional self-report survey (98 items) and embedded qualitative interview study across Sweden, with a target sample size of n=365. Participants are aged 16-39 years, diagnosed with cancer when 0-18 years and have completed successful cancer treatment. The survey examines sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, actual help-seeking behaviour, attitudes towards e-MH, stigma of mental illness, mental health literacy, social support and current symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Survey respondents with past and/or current experience of mental health difficulties are invited into the qualitative interview study to explore: (1) perceived need for mental health support; (2) past experience of receiving mental health support; (3) preferences for support; and (4) barriers and facilitators to help-seeking. Potential associations between health service use factors and help-seeking behaviour are examined using univariable and multivariable logistic regressions. Qualitative interviews are analysed using content analysis. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been obtained from the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (Dnr: 2020-06271). Results will be disseminated in scientific publications and academic conference presentations. Trial registration number ISRCTN70570236. ©

AB  - Objective: A national program on providing comprehensive social and mental health services, entitled "SERAJ"was developed and piloted in three districts of Iran. The present study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of SERAJ by conducting assessments before and after the implementation in the intervention and the control areas. Method: This was a controlled community trial that was assessed by conducting repeated surveys in the intervention and the control areas. In total, 2952 and 2874 individuals were assessed in the intervention and the control areas, respectively. The change in prevalence of mental disorders (using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview; CIDI), service utilization, mental health literacy, happiness, and perceived social support were measured over 18 months in three districts of Osko, Bardsir, and Quchan as the intervention areas, which were compared with three matched districts as the control areas. Results: No significant difference was found in the mean score of happiness between the intervention and the control areas throughout the study period. Most aspects of mental health literacy were improved in the intervention areas after implementing the intervention. The mean score of social support decreased after implementing the intervention in all areas. The prevalence of mental disorders in the intervention districts was significantly reduced after 18 months. The rate of using any mental health services after the intervention was not statistically different between the intervention and the control areas. Conclusion: There was no significant change in some indicators in the intervention compared with the control areas. We suggest evaluating SERAJ's achievements and challenges in the three intervention districts before expanding the implementation of this pilot experience into other districts. © © 2021 Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present the findings of a preliminary study based on a novel structured mental health education programme – Innate Health Education and Resilience Training (iHEART) – in a cohort of secondary school adolescents in the UK. Design/methodology/approach: A curriculum-based ten-week programme was delivered by trained facilitators. In total, 205 students enrolled in the study. An additional 64 participants were within an age-matched non-intervention control group. A non-randomised control mixed methodology approach was used. All students, pre- and post-programme, completed a quantitative questionnaire – the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Survey. Qualitative measures were used to assess participants’ perceptions of changes in their resilience and mental well-being. Findings: Those who received the intervention showed a small improvement in mental well-being relative to those who did not, with a similar change in resilience. Qualitative findings regarding impulse control and emotional resilience provided positive findings. Originality/value: iHEART may be a promising new intervention offering a step change in mental health education for improving resilience, mental well-being and the ability for participants to navigate psychological challenges. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Aims: There has been a surge in child mental health literacy training programmes for non-mental health professionals. No previous review has examined the effectiveness of child mental literacy training on all professionals in contact with children. Methods: Studies were identified through a systematic literature search of the Cochrane, EMBASE, Medline, and PsycINFO databases in February 2019. The review included studies that delivered training to professionals who have regular contact with young people aged 0 to 19 in the context of their role and at least one component of mental health literacy; (a) knowledge, (b) attitudes, (c) confidence in helping, (d) intention to help and (e) actual helping behaviour. The quality of papers was reviewed using the Cochrane revised Risk of Bias Tool for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and the Integrated Quality Criteria for the Review of Multiple Study Designs for non RCTs. Results: Twenty-one studies met eligibility criteria (n = 3243). There was some evidence that global and specific child mental health literacy training improved professionals' knowledge and stigma-related attitudes towards mental health. Few studies investigated the impact of training on actual helping behaviour. Conclusion: There may be value in providing child mental health literacy training to professionals in contact with children, however there is a need for studies to evaluate the long-term impact of such training, particularly on subsequent access to appropriate support. Findings raise concerns about the quality of the studies reported in the systematic review and recommendations are made for future studies. © 2020 The Authors Early Intervention in Psychiatry Published by John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd

AB  - Background and Objective: Enhancing the mental health literacy(MHL) through school-based education intervention may encourage mental health promotion, prevention, and care and reduce stigma in adolescents. The present study aimed to determine the effect of educational intervention on MHL among middle school female students in Mashhad. Materials and Methods: A quasi-experimental study was carried out on 140 female students aged between 13-15 years from two governmental middle schools in 2019 Mashhad, Iran. A multistage sampling method was used. First, one education area was randomly selected andtwo middle schools were randomly selected from this area. One middle school was considered as intervention setting and the other middle school considered as control setting. Atotal of 70 students were randomly selected from each school and allocated into two intervention and control group. Mental Health Literacy Scale (MHLS) was used to estimate MHL among student in two stages (before and after intervention). The intervention group were received four training sessions (90 minutes) based on MHL concept. Descriptive, Paired t-test, independent sample t-test and Chi-square test were used to analyze the data using spss21 software.. Results: Before the intervention, the two groups had no significant difference in the mean score of MHL (P>0.05). After the intervention, the mean score of MHL increased from 10.5±1.34 to 17.27±11.33 in the intervention group which was statistically significant (P<0.001). Conclusion: Designing and implementing educational interventions can promote MHL of middle school female students. © 2021, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rationale: In Scotland, two-thirds of children have faced at least one adverse childhood experience. Research demonstrates a graded relationship between adversity and mental health outcomes. As adolescents spend a large amount of time in school, it is no surprise that schools are vital when supporting and delivering mental health interventions. Aim: The research aims were two-fold: to gather a clear understanding of mental health and wellbeing supports within a secondary school in Scotland; and to explore the use of Appreciative Inquiry as an approach for organisational change. Method: Semi-structured interviews were conducted, using an Appreciative Inquiry approach. A purposive sampling method was employed to select 55 secondary school stakeholders. Findings: Results highlighted several targeted supports in place within the secondary school, with the adoption of more consistent and visible universal systems needed. Key themes identified included: the importance of relationships, ensuring mental health literacy is core to the curriculum and encouraging an open conversation about mental health. The use of Appreciate Inquiry led to a clear action plan for the secondary school, building upon strengths already identified within the organisation. Limitations: One secondary school took part in this research, therefore, results cannot be generalised. Participants were school-based, future research should consider the role of external agencies. Conclusions: This research provides an insight into the current mechanisms in place within a secondary school in Scotland to support mental health and wellbeing. The use of Appreciative Inquiry was an effective approach for creating a plan intended to impact organisational change. © 2021, British Psychological Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Parents’ perceptions of their children’s mental health—including recognition of specific mental health problems as such, and their beliefs about the causes and treatments for the problems—have an important impact on child mental health. This study investigated child mental health literacy among Cambodian and Vietnamese mothers. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 357 mothers in Hanoi, Vietnam, and Pnom Penh and Kampong Speu, Cambodia. The Child Mental Health Literacy Questionnaire was used to assess mothers’ mental health literacy, in particular, their ability to correctly identify different mental health disorders, and their understanding of causes of the mental health problems, and about the utility of different treatments. The overall level of mental health literacy among mothers in these two countries was low, with the proportions of mothers able to correctly identify different mental health problems ranging from 0.17 (Oppositional Defiant Disorder) to 0.35 (Trauma-related). Biological causes and adverse experiences were the most frequently selected causes of generic mental health problems. Medication, parent training and family counseling were the three most positively rated forms of treatment for mental health problems in general. Although Vietnam and Cambodia are geographic neighbors, varying results across these countries appear to reflect their different historical backgrounds. For instance, the largest difference between the two countries was for trauma-related problems, which may be related to the Cambodian history of genocide. Findings such as this demonstrate the need for contextually developed and focused public health intervention for mothers of children to improve their mental health literacy. © 2021, National Academy of Psychology (NAOP) India.

AB  - Stigma and negative attitudes towards people with mental illness are frequently found among nursing students. Interventions targeting mental illness stigma are the critical elements in altering the status. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of the psychiatric-mental health education with role-play and real-world contact on stigma of nursing students towards people with mental illness in China. A single group pretest and posttest study design was adopted and total 373 students were recruited whilst 343 completed the course. We integrated the role-play and contact with patients in the routine psychiatric-mental health education. After the education was completed, the students' stigma towards people with mental illness were positively changed (pretest mean score of stigma: 53.77, posttest mean score of stigma: 49.01, 95% CI: 2.63–6.87) and their willingness to care for the people with mental illness was also significantly increased (pretest mean score of willingness: 5.45, posttest mean score of willingness: 7.38, 95% CI: −2.22–−1.65). The psychiatric-mental health education especially with integrated role-play and real-world contact is an effective way to reduce nursing students’ stigma and negative attitudes towards people with mental illness and increases their willingness to care for people with mental illness. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Women are exposed to increased burden of mental disorders during the perinatal period: 13–19% experience postpartum depression. Perinatal psychological suffering affects early mother-child relationship, impacting child’s emotional and cognitive development. Return-to-work brings additional vulnerability given the required balance between parenting and job demands. The MAternal Mental Health in the WORKplace (MAMH@WORK) project aims to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a brief and sustainable intervention, promoting (a) maternal mental health throughout pregnancy and first 12 months after delivery, and (b) quality of mother–child interactions, child emotional self-regulation, and cognitive self-control, while (c) reducing perinatal absenteeism and presenteeism. MAMH@WORK is a three-arm randomized controlled trial. A short-term cognitive-behavioral therapy-based (CBT-based) psychoeducation plus biofeedback intervention will be implemented by psychiatrists and psychologists, following a standardized procedure manual developed after consensus (Delphi method). Participants (n = 225, primiparous, singleton pregnant women at 28–30 weeks gestational age, aged 18–40 years, employed) will be randomly allocated to arms: CBT-based psychoeducation intervention (including mindfulness); psychoeducation plus biofeedback intervention; and control. Assessments will take place before and after delivery. Main outcomes (and main tools): mental health literacy (MHLS), psychological wellbeing (HADS, EPDS, KBS, CD-RISC, BRIEF COPE), quality of mother–child interaction, child– mother attachment, child emotional self-regulation and cognitive self-control (including PBQ, Strange Situation Procedure, QDIBRB, SGS-II, CARE-Index), job engagement (UWES), and presenteeism. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses will be conducted; Cohen’s d coefficient, Cramer’s V and odds ratio will be used to assess the effect size of the intervention. MAMH@WORK is expected to contribute to mental health promotion during the perinatal period and beyond. Its results have the potential to inform health policies regarding work–life balance and maternal mental health and wellbeing promotion in the workplace. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Children with chronic physical health conditions are up to six times more likely to develop a mental health condition than their physically well peers. Frontline pediatric hospital staff are in a good position to identify mental health problems and facilitate appropriate support for patients. To date, no evaluation of mental health literacy training has taken place with this professional group to enable early identification of difficulties. It is also not known whether face-to-face or digital training is more effective or preferable in this setting. To improve the skills of frontline hospital staff, a face-to-face and digital mental health literacy training course was delivered using MindEd content and evaluated in a randomized controlled trial. Method: Two-hundred and three frontline staff across different professions from a tertiary pediatric hospital were randomized to a face-to-face (n = 64), digital (n = 71), or waitlist control group (n = 68). Face-to-face training was two and a half hours and digital training took ~1 h. The effects of training were evaluated pre- and post-training and at two-week follow-up. Questionnaires assessed mental health knowledge, stigma, confidence in recognizing concerns and knowing what to do, actual helping behavior, as well as training delivery preference, completion rate, and satisfaction. Results: Both face-to-face and digital training increased mental health knowledge, confidence in recognizing mental health problems and knowing what to do compared to waitlist controls. Digital training increased actual helping behavior relative to the waitlist controls and stigma decreased across all groups. Staff were satisfied with both delivery methods but preferred face-to-face training. Conclusions: The results provide promising findings that digital content is an effective way of improving mental health literacy in frontline pediatric hospital staff. Providing digital training could be a time-efficient way of upskilling non-mental health professionals to identify mental health needs in a pediatric population and facilitate access to appropriate care. © Copyright © 2021 O'Connell, Shafran and Pote.

AB  - The provision of mental health services within schools has a number of associated barriers and challenges. Meaningful integration of mental health supports into school systems can help overcome these barriers and contribute to improved quality of services. Students can only benefit from these services after high-quality implementation is achieved. Implementation support can be enhanced by improving both individual-level and intervention-specific staff capacity. Enhancing school-level capacity paired with partnering with community organizations can promote a school's ability to provide informed and effective mental health care to their students. Effective implementation is guided by interdisciplinary collaboration between school behavioral health personnel, school staff, youth-serving organizations, and families to align programs and services and improve outcomes for students. Also foundational are effective communication systems and data sharing between diverse stakeholders involved in school behavioral health programming. All of these themes addressed together can contribute to the effective implementation of school behavioral health. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - Diversity is related to many aspects of development that are important to consider when providing care to individuals, although it is necessary to recognize that individual development is nuanced and may not manifest in individuals in ways that completely adhere to their culture. The concept of cultural humility recognizes these challenges and focuses on self-reflection and empathy to be open to new ideas while being intentional about developing partnerships with those who identify with other cultures. Within the context of school behavioral health (SBH), it is important to note that minority students continue to face inequities in the care they receive and receipt of exclusionary discipline. When providing services to these students, it is crucial that stereotypes and stigma be taken into account. Normalizing diversity can help reduce the effects of these problems. Further, addressing stigma related and providing training on mental health literacy can improve help-seeking for diverse groups of students and their families. Emphasizing cultural humility in SBH will help ensure the effectiveness and relevance of these programs for diverse students. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - teen Mental Health First Aid (teenMHFA) is a school-based mental health program that trains adolescents to support peers who are experiencing mental health problems or crises. The program has been evaluated for adolescents aged 15-18 years as part of a randomized controlled trial, however qualitative feedback from students on their perceptions of the program is yet to be explored. The current study describes the perspectives of students who took part in the trial. Feedback on the perceived strengths and weaknesses of the program was provided by 979 Year 10 students (M = 15.82 years, female = 43.94%, English as a first language = 72.77%) at four government funded public schools in Melbourne, Australia via online surveys. A content and thematic analysis was performed on the data using a six-step process. Students generally found the program relevant and they connected with the visual material, personal stories and interactive activities. Suggestions for improvements included encouraging active student participation in classroom discussion and providing opportunities to practice skills. School-based mental health education can benefit from input from stakeholder perspectives, particularly when designing mental health content for delivery by external trainers. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - This controlled trial evaluated the effectiveness of a mental health literacy intervention for parents delivered through community sport clubs. In total, 540 parents (321 females, 219 males) of adolescent athletes participated in a brief educational workshop on youth mental health (n = 352) or a community-matched control group (n = 188). Generalised linear mixed models revealed no significant improvements in the intervention group compared to control in the primary mental health literacy outcomes, at 1 month follow-up. However, parents in the intervention group were more likely to seek formal help for themselves, had increased confidence and knowledge to help someone experiencing a mental health disorder, experienced reduced psychological distress, and perceived more support from other parents in their sport club, relative to the control group. Overall, the findings suggest that a brief educational intervention delivered through community sports clubs can positively affect some components of parents’ mental health literacy. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This chapter will examine why mental health education and training should be the business of every health professional and why psychiatric training should undergo curriculum revision. With the advent of online technology, there is a real opportunity to access education and training delivered by expert educators at home or in clinics in different parts of the world. This chapter will examine the features, advantages, and challenges associated with online psychiatric education. While online learning seems to be a good solution to enhancing dissemination of knowledge and skills, easy access to training and education materials does not necessarily guarantee the quality or appropriateness of the student experience or learning acquired. Local, regional, and national psychiatric societies should play a strategic role in steering the future direction of psychiatric training and setting quality standards of training commensurate with local resources and cultures. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

AB  - Objectives: This systematic review aims to evaluate the results of school-based randomized controlled trials conducted to improve psychosocial well-being in children and adolescents. Moreover, it aims to evaluate the contribution of nurses to this field. Methods: Randomized controlled studies involving school-based mental health programs published between 2010 and 2019 were screened in PubMed, Scopus and CINAHL databases using the combination of the keywords “school mental health,” "nurses," "school-based," "intervention," "mental health promotion," "school mental health services," and "school-based mental health interventions." Note that 16 studies were included in this systematic review. Results: The study results revealed the benefits of programs focused on improving positive mental health and psychological well-being. Current results demonstrate that psychosocial well-being programs improve targeted social emotional skills, life skills, communication skills, problem-solving skills, self-awareness, flexibility, anger management, self-esteem, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, positive body perception and mental health literacy. It was observed that the use of interactive methods such as games and small group work in programs was more effective than didactic information teaching methods. Moreover, it was reported that nurses did not adequately take part in these programs. In the methodological quality assessment, there were studies with questionable methodological features. Conclusion: Based on these results, we recommended that nurses should conduct school-based mental health programs with high methodological quality to improve community mental health. © 2021 by Journal of Psychiatric Nursing-.

AB  - Health literacy has become an in-tegral part of functional literacy and a measure of human capital development in a particular country. Health literacy among secondary school students is particularly important because they are at high risk for health problems. Because the existing studies on health literacy have been conducted primarily in the United States and Western Europe, there is a research gap in the field of comprehensive studies of health literacy in Central and Eastern European countries. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the level of health literacy of Slovenian secondary school students using a quantitative, descriptive method. The questionnaire measuring the level of basic, nu-merical, critical and mental health literacy was com-pleted by 249 Slovenian secondary school students, who were divided into two groups, namely of students attending the nursing programme and others. The results showed that nursing students have statistically significantly higher levels of basic and mental health literacy than their peers, but not of numerical and critical health literacy. Both aspects of health literacy should be systematically developed, and at least the basic aspects of health literacy should be introduced in all secondary school curricula. © 2021, Pedagoska Obzorja d.o.o.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to determine the level of mental health literacy (MHL) of healthcare professionals who do not work in a mental health unit. METHODS: This was a descriptive, cross-sectional study. The study group comprised 239 health professionals (nurses, dieticians, midwives, medical assistants, biologists, social service specialist, child development specialists) who worked in departments other than the mental health unit of a training and research hospital. A sociodemographic data form and the Mental Health Literacy Scale (MHLS) were used to collect the study data. The mean, SD, minimum and maximum values, and percentage were used to describe the data after analysis using the Mann-Whitney U test and the Kruskal-Wallis test. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 29.93±8.71 years, and they had a mean of 8.9±9.04 years of professional experience. The majority of the participants were female (n=206; 86.2%), and single (n=140; 58.6%). The mean total MHL score was 16.96±3.30. The mean knowledge subscale score was 8.45±1.69, and the mean score of the belief subscale was 5.32±1.70. Age, marital status, education level, and occupation were significant; gender was not a statistically significant variable. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The MHL level of the health professionals participating in the study was above average, but less than optimal. Educational programs to increase the knowledge of all healthcare staff would benefit patient care and promote early intervention. © 2021 Psikiyatri Hemşireliği Dergisi - Çevrimiçi: www.phdergi.org.

AB  - Despite the prevalence of mental health related stigma in Muslim communities, there are only a limited number of intervention studies reported in the literature. Digital interventions (i.e., YouTube clips, videos) are relatively cheap, highly accessible and easily disseminated and are increasingly being used to improve mental health literacy and reduce mental health related stigma. However, as far as the authors are aware, there are no stigma reduction programmes targeting Muslim communities that leverage digital interventions reported in the literature. This paper outlines a protocol for a digital intervention to challenge mental health related stigma in Muslim communities. The proposed intervention will be a 5 to 10-minute YouTube clip/video the active ingredients of which will be: [1] an interview with a Muslim expert by lived/living experience, [2] an Imam (Muslim faith leader) and [3] a psychiatrist. We will recruit members of Muslim communities living in Muslim minority countries in the Global North (United Kingdom, Unites States of America, Canada, Australia and New Zealand) to participate in the study (inclusion criteria: adults aged 18 years and over, Muslim background). The study will be comprised of two groups: an active group that will be exposed to the Muslim faith appropriate digital intervention and a control group that will be exposed to a digital intervention that is not Muslim faith appropriate. We will administer validated psychometric stigma scales on participants in both groups before and after exposure to the interventions. We hypothesize that viewing an anti-stigma clip/video that is Islamic faith appropriate will be associated with greater reductions in mental health related stigma in members of Muslim communities compared to viewing an anti-stigma clip/video that is not Islamic faith appropriate. © Medicinska naklada - Zagreb, Croatia

AB  - Purpose: Australian paramedics regularly encounter patients experiencing mental illness. However, some paramedics hold negative attitudes towards the use of emergency services in providing care for these patients. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to examine the mental health literacy (MHL) of Australian paramedic students, and the training and experiential factors associated with MHL. Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectional online survey was delivered to paramedic students across Australia. A total of 94 paramedic students completed the survey examining MHL, mental health first aid (MHFA) intentions, confidence in providing help, personal and perceived stigma and willingness to interact with a person experiencing mental illness. Findings: Participants generally had poor MHFA intentions in spite of good recognition of mental health disorders and good knowledge about mental health. Participants also demonstrated low stigmatising attitudes towards mental illness; however, they expressed a lack of willingness to interact with a person experiencing mental illness. Originality/value: Our findings propose a combination of work-based experience and specific MHFA training may be beneficial to paramedic students to improve care for patients experiencing mental illness. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Introduction: Health literacy of secondary school students is particularly important as they are exposed to higher health risk. Therefore, the aim of the study is to determine the level of basic health literacy, critical and mental health literacy, and numeracy of Slovenian secondary school nursing students using a cross-sectional comparative method. Methods: The questionnaire measuring the level of basic numerical, critical, and mental health literacy was completed by 249 secondary school students, divided into a group of secondary school students attending a nursing program and students of others similar secondary schools such as economic technician, chemical technician and preschool education. Results: Secondary nursing students were found to have statistically significantly higher levels of basic and mental health literacy than their peers, rather than numerical and critical health literacy. In addition, the results show that there is no statistically significant difference in the level of health literacy between the groups of secondary school students in relation to the environment (rural/urban area). Conclusion: Numerical and critical health literacy should be systematically developed in nursing schools, and at least the basic aspects of health literacy should be introduced in all secondary school curricula. © 2021.

AB  - Background and Objective: Poor mental health literacy is a major obstacle to seeking help for mental health problems in adolescents. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of school-based educational interventions on improving mental health literacy (MHL) in adolescents. Materials and Methods: In this study, a search was conducted in Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Irandoc, Magiran, and SID databases in both Persian and English language for studies published from 2011 to 2021. The keywords “adolescent”, “mental health literacy”, “depression literacy”, “intervention”, “education”, and “high school” were searched in both languages. Out of 191 articles extracted and finally, 6 articles were included in this study. Results: The results of the study conducted in Norway showed that the individual’s health literacy who participated in the all “Mental Health” program was significantly increased compared to those in the control group; findings of a study conducted in Australia reported that MHL in the intervention group was significantly higher than the control group after intervention (P <0.05). But, attitudes toward seeking help did not change. A Canadian study indicated that the mental health curriculum significantly increased mental health knowledge and reduced mental tagging (P <0.001); furthermore, an Iranian study demonstrated that the mean score of MHL in the intervention group was significantly increased compared to the control group after the educational intervention (P <0.001). In the study, which was conducted in the US, depressive literacy in the intervention group was significantly increased 4 months after the intervention. However, results of one study showed that education intervention is more effective than contact based intervention with an ill person (P <0.001). Conclusion: Evidence highlights that although studies have used a variety of methods for adolescent mental health literacy interventions in schools, all studies have had a positive effect on mental health literacy. Given that studies used self-report assessment to measure MHL outcomes. Thus, confirmation of these findings with objective tools is still needed. © 2021, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.

AB  - Objective This paper presents a review of the current state of child and adolescent mental health literacy and provides current evidence of the economic impact of a pediatric mental health literacy (MHL) training program. Methods Employing a case-series-comparison design, physician referrals to urgent and specialized mental health services were linked with patient-specific information comparing referrals from MHL participants and non-participating physicians. The economic impact analysis was based on changes in the admitted referral frequency and lengths of stay for the MHL group, compared to themselves pre-training, and over the same time period compared to non-participating physicians. Results Average scheduled ambulatory admission rates per physician remained constant for trained and untrained pre-post groups. Average scheduled ambulatory admission wait time and length of stay reduced significantly post-training for MHL-trained physicians compared to pre-training and untrained physicians. In addition to reductions in length of stay, the total bed costs saving for emergency/ inpatients admission deferrals was $2,932,112 or about $20,000 per MHL-trained physician. Conclusion The estimated economic impact of the MHL training shows a substantial return on investment and supports wider imple-mentation. The MHL training program should be a key feature of mental health reform strategies, as well as continuing and undergrad-uate medical education. © 2021 Korean Neuropsychiatric Association.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to present the current state of evidence regarding the mental health literacy of paramedics and student paramedics and whether mental health literacy affects the care that paramedics provide to their patients with mental illness. Design/methodology/approach: Embase, PubMed, Medline and Google Scholar were searched for recent (2010–2020) English language published articles using the key phrases paramedic AND/OR ambulance AND mental health AND mental health literacy. Additional searches of the reference lists of included articles were undertaken. A descriptive thematic analysis was used to arrive at a narrative synthesis of the study findings. Findings: The emergency medical services system has taken a primary role in the care of patients with mental illness but has limited capacity for non-emergency psychosocial situations. Negative and judgemental attitudes amongst paramedics towards patients with mental illness is a significant issue and remains a barrier to patients seeking medical care for mental illness. Improved care provision and patient engagement might result from specific education aimed to better enhance paramedics’ mental health literacy. Originality/value: This literature review provides insights into the current practice of mental health training for Australian undergraduate paramedic science students and the implications for patient care.

AB  - Expert by Experience involvement in mental health nursing education is increasing in popularity as a teaching technique. The emerging literature attests to its benefits in enriching the educational experience for students. Much less attention has been devoted to the experience from the perspective of the Experts themselves. To address this gap and ensure this important perspective is captured and considered, the aim of this paper is to present the perceptions and experiences of Experts by Experience in delivering an educational module to mental health nursing students. A qualitative exploratory approach was adopted, involving in-depth individual interviews with Experts by Experience who delivered a learning module to nursing students in Australia and Europe. Data were analysed thematically. Analysis produced two overarching themes: Empowerment, and Challenges. Challenges included six sub-themes: Being constructive, not just critical; Time to unpack and reflect; Need for co-production and support from nursing academics; Emotional and practical support; maintaining personal boundaries; and adapting to the audience. These findings make a significant contribution to a broader understanding of Expert by Experience involvement in mental health education. The use of standards to maintain integrity and avoid tokenism is recommended. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: An increasing number of South Africans utilise primary healthcare services (either in the state or private sector) for mental health concerns; hence, there is a need to objectively assess these doctors’ attitudes and knowledge of mental illness. Aim: To investigate aspects of knowledge and attitudes towards mental illness of a group of private and state-employed non-specialist medical doctors. Method: Doctors in the state sector who were working at a primary healthcare level and who were not working towards, or did not hold, a specialist qualification were considered eligible for the study. Doctors in the private sector who were working as general practitioners and who did not hold a specialist qualification were considered eligible for the study. Data were collected by means of a self-administered questionnaire. A link to the study questionnaire, information about the study, details of the researcher and matters pertaining to informed consent were emailed to potential participants. Results: Of the 140 practitioners who responded to the survey, 51.4% (n = 72) worked in the state sector, 41.4% (n = 58) worked in the private sector and 7.1% (n = 10) worked in both the state and private sectors (χ2 = 45.31, p < 0.010). The majority (> 50%) of participants in all three 1 groups had a positive attitude towards mental illness (χ2 = 1.52, p = 0.468). Although there 2 were no significant associations between attitude and socio-demographic characteristics (p > 0.05), male SS doctors reported feeling less comfortable when dealing with mentally ill patients (p = 0.015); SS doctors who did not have family contact with mental illness were less likely to feel that mentally ill patients did not pose a risk to others (p = 0.007), and PS doctors under the age of 35 years were more likely to feel adequately trained to treat mental illness (p = 0.026). The majority (> 50%) of participants in all three groups had an adequate level of knowledge of mental illness (modal scores = 10). There were no significant associations between knowledge and socio-demographic characteristics (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Despite the findings of a positive attitude and adequate knowledge of mental illness amongst the participants of this study, it is recommended that more targeted interventions are established to further improve mental health awareness and knowledge of doctors at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels of study. © 2021.

AB  - Ongoing education in mental health literacy offered by academic, clinical, and hospital librarians paired with health science professionals presents ideal opportunities for continued improvement of practical, lifelong skill sets in research and mental health literacy. This review synthesizes where academic and hospital librarians have been integral in providing information literacy instruction for health science students and medical professionals; information literacy has transformed theoretical research into practical and life-long opportunities for practicing mental health literacy; and medical professionals transfer prior information literacy and evidence-based practice training to mental health literacy as workplace practices in hospital and health care settings. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose In this study, we tested the effectiveness of a multicomponent sports-based program aimed at promoting early intervention, help seeking, and resilience among a sample of adolescent male sport participants. Methods The Ahead of the Game program comprised four intervention components and a messaging campaign. Two components targeted mental health literacy, intentions to seek and provide help, and resilience among adolescent boys. A mental health literacy program for parents and a coach education program to assist in the support of athletes' psychological needs were also included. We evaluated the program using a nonrandomized controlled trial matching two regional communities. In total, 350 sport participants (mean, 14.53 yr) were included in an intervention group, whereas 466 (mean, 14.66 yr) received usual practice in a matched control community. One hundred and eighty parents or caregivers and eight coaches also participated in the intervention components. Between-group mean differences on the primary and secondary outcomes were analyzed using linear mixed models, adjusted for clustering at club level, participant age, and socioeconomic status. Results Significant positive group-time interactions were found for the primary outcomes of depression and anxiety literacy, intentions to seek help from formal sources, confidence to seek mental health information, and resilience. We also found a significant positive group-time interaction for the secondary outcome of well-being. There were no group-time interactions for social distance (stigma), intentions to seek help from informal sources, implicit beliefs about adversity, perceived familial support, or psychological distress. Conclusions Given the high rates of sport participation worldwide and the increasing focus on mental health in this domain, translation and dissemination of the program may be warranted after replication. © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Background: Mental health literacy (MHL) is vital for raising mental health awareness, reducing stigma, and improving health-related decision making, which may have lifelong consequences for patients with mental disorders. Aims: To examine MHL about depression among rural left-behind children (LBC) in China and explore differences between LBC and non-left-behind children (NLBC). Methods: A total of 3456 rural school children (mean age = 13.02 years) in fourth to ninth grades who were living in Sichuan, Anhui, and Henan provinces were surveyed in April and July 2018 using stratified random cluster sampling. Results: More NLBC correctly recognized depression compared with LBC (p < 0.05). The most common sources of mental health information were the TV and the Internet. LBC felt more uneasy if they asked for help (p < 0.01). Statistical differences in help-seeking barriers were observed between LBC and NLBC (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Respondents showed low levels of depression-related MHL compared with peer groups in other countries, LBC showed lower MHL than NLBC in terms of the correct recognition rate of depression, attitude toward seeking help, etc. More school-based interventions should be implemented in rural schools, and parent involvement and digital-based educational strategies should be considered. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Adolescents are at increased risk of mental illness and prefer to seek help from informal supports. By increasing knowledge and skills, peers may act as gatekeepers to mental health services. The aim of the current study was to assess the effects of a brief sports-based mental health literacy program to increase competencies and intentions to both provide and seek help for mental health problems among adolescent male sports participants. A cluster-randomized controlled trial was conducted with measures taken at 3 time points: baseline (2 weeks prior to intervention), immediately postintervention, and at 1-month follow-up. Adolescents were randomized to either the intervention group (n = 47) or a waitlist control group (n = 55) at a team level (n <inf>teams</inf> = 9). Participants were 102 male adolescents 12–18 years of age (M = 14.30, SD = 1.75) from a community football club in New South Wales, Australia. A 45-min Help Out a Mate (HOAM) workshop was delivered around a usual team practice session. Compared to the waitlist control, participants in the HOAM condition reported significant increases in knowledge of signs and symptoms of mental illness, intentions to provide help to a friend who may be experiencing a mental health problem, and attitudes that promote problem recognition and help-seeking. There were no between-group differences in confidence to provide help, personal help-seeking intentions, and psychological distress. The results suggest that a brief intervention can be effective at improving the mental health literacy of young men when delivered within a sports context. Lay summary: Compared to a waitlist control, the Help Out a Mate group showed improvements in mental health literacy for depression and anxiety and intentions to provide help along with sustained improvements in attitudes that promote help-seeking and reduce stigma. Personal help-seeking intentions did not change as a result of the program. © 2019 Association for Applied Sport Psychology.

AB  - Promotion of good mental health in young people is important. Our aim was to evaluate the consistency and magnitude of the efficacy of universal/selective interventions to promote good mental health. A systematic PRISMA/RIGHT-compliant meta-analysis (PROSPERO: CRD42018088708) search of Web of Science until 04/31/2019 identified original studies comparing the efficacy of universal/selective interventions for good mental health vs a control group, in samples with a mean age <35 years. Meta-analytical random-effects model, heterogeneity statistics, assessment of publication bias, study quality and sensitivity analyses investigated the efficacy (Hedges’ g=effect size, ES) of universal/selective interventions to promote 14 good mental health outcomes defined a-priori. 276 studies were included (total participants: 159,508, 79,142 interventions and 80,366 controls), mean age=15.0 (SD=7.4); female=56.0%. There was a significant overall improvement in 10/13 good mental health outcome categories that could be meta-analysed: compared to controls, interventions significantly improved (in descending order of magnitude) mental health literacy (ES=0.685, p<0.001), emotions (ES=0.541, p<0.001), self-perceptions and values (ES=0.49, p<0.001), quality of life (ES=0.457, p=0.001), cognitive skills (ES=0.428, p<0.001), social skills (ES=0.371, p<0.001), physical health (ES=0.285, p<0.001), sexual health (ES=0.257, p=0.017), academic/occupational performance (ES=0.211, p<0.001) and attitude towards mental disorders (ES=0.177, p=0.006). Psychoeducation was the most effective intervention for promoting mental health literacy (ES=0.774, p<0.001) and cognitive skills (ES=1.153, p=0.03). Physical therapy, exercise and relaxation were more effective than psychoeducation and psychotherapy for promoting physical health (ES=0.498, p<0.001). In conclusion, several universal/selective interventions can be effective to promote good mental health in young people. Future research should consolidate and extend these findings. © 2020

AB  - What is known on the subject?: Adults who support an adult family member with a severe and enduring mental health problem often experience carer burden. Over time, this often negatively affects their mental and physical health and social well-being. Understanding and communicating about mental health problems in families can help to improve resilience and coping among both adults and children. What does this paper add to existing knowledge?: We conducted a review of studies looking at how adult relatives understand and communicate about an adult family member's mental health problem. The findings highlight that how relatives make sense of MHP is related to historical family relationships, their mental health literacy and whether they see themselves as a “carer” or not. The findings also show that little research to date has explored how adult relatives talk with children about their parent's difficulties, and how the adults’ understanding might affect what children learn about the MHP. What are the implications for practice?: There is a research gap to be addressed regarding family communication with children about parental mental health problems. This knowledge gap likely impacts family-focused mental health nursing and therapy provision. Mental health nursing, therapeutic and support workers and advocates are ideally positioned to assist relatives with improving their mental health literacy and confidence communicating about mental health, and to promote inclusion of relatives and children in interventions. Abstract: Introduction Relatives are profoundly affected by an adult family member's severe and enduring mental health problem (MHP). The burdens of caring impact on adult relatives’ emotional, physical and social well-being. How relatives make meaning and communicate about the MHP is thought to affect family talk about mental health, and this can impact family coping and well-being. Aim No review has yet drawn together research about how adult relatives of people with severe and enduring MHP make meaning and communicate about their relatives’ difficulties. We aimed to address this gap. Method We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed primary research. SCOPUS, PubMed, Psychnet, SCIE, Cochrane and CINAHL+ databases were searched. Results Nineteen papers qualified for inclusion. Findings are organized under four themes: making meaning about the MHP and affected individual; conceptualizing the self in the presence of the MHP; meaning-making processes underlying relatives’ well-being outcomes; and relatives’ perspectives on family talk about the MHP. Discussion Historical relationships, caregiver identity and mental health literacy moderate relatives’ understanding and talk about the MHP. Implications for practice Psychoeducation and communication support for relatives should be provided by mental health practitioners. Future research should address familial communication about MHP, including with children. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Purpose: The Mentally Healthy Schools Framework (MHSF), based on the population-wide Act-Belong-Commit mental health promotion campaign, is a whole-school approach primarily targeting student mental health, but it is also intended for staff. This paper presents the results of an impact survey on staff after the implementation of the Framework in a number of schools in Western Australia. Design/methodology/approach: A baseline questionnaire was completed by n = 87 staff at schools that had just signed up to the programme, and a participant questionnaire was completed by n = 146 staff at schools that had been participating for at least 17 months. Findings: The results show that the Framework has had a substantial impact on many staff in terms of increased mental health literacy and taking action to improve their mental health. Originality/value: Mental health interventions in schools generally focus on students' well-being and how to deal with student mental health problems. There are few comprehensive interventions that also include staff well-being. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The present study aimed at identifying the prerequisites, facilitators, and barriers to adolescent mental health literacy interventions. To that end, databases PsycINFO, Science Direct, Scopus, Emerald, PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were systematically searched, out of which 39 articles that had the inclusion criteria were analyzed by the content analysis. Databases searched from September 30, 2018, to October 10, 2018, with the keywords 'health literacy,' 'mental health literacy,' 'mental disorders,' adolescents, students, and more. Seven themes were identified as the prerequisites for interventions to improve adolescents' mental health literacy including education at the school level, parents' education, training of trainers and providers, cooperation and participation among providers, intervention assessment and monitoring, provision of educational content, consideration of the cultural and linguistic issues. Five themes were identified as facilitators: using interactive learning and teaching methods, supplying diverse and stimulating educational content, employing trainers with different backgrounds, having direct contact with people with mental illness, and utilizing technological advancements in education. Finally, short-time intervention, the collaboration between school administrators and researchers, lack of valid information sources were identified as barriers. © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

AB  - Background: Quality of life for children and adolescents living with serious parental mental illness can be impaired, but evidence-based interventions to improve it are scarce. Objective: Co-production of a child-centred intervention [called Young Simplifying Mental Illness plus Life Enhancement Skills (SMILES)] to improve the health-related quality of life of children and adolescents living with serious parental mental illness, and evaluating its acceptability and feasibility for delivery in NHS and community settings. Design: Qualitative and co-production methods informed the development of the intervention (Phase I). A feasibility randomised controlled trial was designed to compare Young SMILES with treatment as usual (Phase II). Semistructured qualitative interviews were used to explore acceptability among children and adolescents living with their parents, who had serious mental illness, and their parents. A mixture of semistructured qualitative interviews and focus group research was used to examine feasibility among Young SMILES facilitators and referrers/non-referrers. Setting: Randomisation was conducted after baseline measures were collected by the study co-ordinator, ensuring that the blinding of the statistician and research team was maintained to reduce detection bias. Participants: Phase I: 14 children and adolescents living with serious parental mental illness, seven parents and 31 practitioners from social, educational and health-related sectors. Phase II: 40 children and adolescents living with serious parental mental illness, 33 parents, five referrers/non-referrers and 16 Young SMILES facilitators. Intervention: Young SMILES was delivered at two sites: (1) Warrington, supported by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), and (2) Newcastle, supported by the NHS and Barnardo’s. An eight-session weekly group programme was delivered, with four to six children and adolescents living with serious parental mental illness per age-appropriate group (6–11 and 12–16 years). At week 4, a five-session parallel weekly programme was offered to the parents/carers. Sessions lasted 2 hours each and focused on improving mental health literacy, child–parent communication and children’s problem-solving skills. Main outcome measures: Phase ll children and parents completed questionnaires at randomisation and then again at 4 and 6 months post randomisation. Quality of life was self-reported by children and proxy-reported by parents using the Paediatric Quality of Life questionnaire and KIDSCREEN. Semistructured interviews with parents (n = 14) and children (n = 17) who participated in the Young SMILES groups gathered information about their motivation to sign up to the study, their experiences of participating in the group sessions, and their perceived changes in themselves and their family members following intervention. Further interviews with individual referrers (n = 5) gathered information about challenges to recruitment and randomisation. Two focus groups (n = 16) with practitioners who facilitated the intervention explored their views of the format and content of the Young SMILES manual and their suggestions for changes. Results: A total of 35 families were recruited: 20 were randomly allocated to Young SMILES group and 15 to treatment as usual. Of those, 28 families [15/20 (75%) in the intervention group and 13/15 (87%) in the control group] gave follow-up data at the primary end point (4 months post baseline). Participating children had high adherence to the intervention and high completion rates of the questionnaires. Children and adolescents living with their parents, who had serious mental illness, and their parents were mainly very positive and enthusiastic about Young SMILES, both of whom invoked the benefits of peer support and insight into parental difficulties. Although facilitators regarded Young SMILES as a meaningful and distinctive intervention having great potential, referrers identified several barriers to referring families to the study. One harm was reported by a parent, which was dealt with by the research team and the NSPCC in accordance with the standard operating procedures. Limitations: The findings from our feasibility study are not sufficient to recommend a fully powered trial of Young SMILES in the near future. Although it was feasible to randomise children and adolescents living with serious parental mental illness of different ages to standardised, time-limited groups in both NHS and non-NHS settings, an intervention like Young SMILES is unlikely to address underlying core components of the vulnerability that children and adolescents living with serious parental mental illness express as a population over time. Conclusions: Young SMILES was widely valued as unique in filling a recognised gap in need. Outcome measures in future studies of interventions for children and adolescents living with serious parental mental illness are more likely to capture change in individual risk factors for reduced quality of life by considering their unmet need, rather than on an aggregate construct of health-related quality of life overall, which may not reflect these young people’s needs. © Queen’s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2020.

AB  - Behavioral family interventions are an effective way to intervene to prevent negative developmental outcomes for adolescents. Participation in family interventions encompasses behavioral and cognitive/attitudinal dimensions, among others, indicated by retention and engagement, respectively. Two dimensions of participation, retention and engagement, in a family intervention were examined in a sample of newly homeless adolescents and their parents or guardians. Correlates of participation included parents with more income and less perceived family conflict and adolescents with higher endorsement of depression, anxiety, somatization, obsessive-compulsive, phobic, and psychotic symptoms on the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). Stronger therapeutic alliance was correlated with being more distressed (i.e., lower income, more hostility), being a female adolescent participant, and having greater comfort discussing sex with parents. Furthermore, parents and adolescents with greater distress and thus greater need were more apt to finish the intervention. The finding that families who were experiencing more distress had higher alliance scores suggests that there is an additional need for development of interventions for families in crisis. Both participant and provider perceptions are also important in development of a strong therapeutic alliance. This study’s findings have implications for further exploration of the development of cultural humility and improving mental health literacy among facilitators of behavioral interventions. © 2020, Society for Prevention Research.

AB  - It is recognized that mental health literacy is vital in both the prevention of mental health problems and in mental health promotion and empowerment of adolescents. In spite of this, only a limited number of tools assessing mental health literacy among adolescents have been developed and most of these have not been adequately tested. In this study, a questionnaire assessing mental health literacy was developed and tested using a three-step approach: 1) item generation in which the principles of public patient involvement were essential, 2) item testing and 3) exploration of psychometric properties. Internal consistency of the questionnaire was determined through Cronbach's alpha and confirmatory factor analysis was conducted in order to determine the construct validity of the questionnaire. The results demonstrated partly skewed data, good internal consistency, good Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin and acceptable results in the goodness of fit index. The initial results suggest that the questionnaire developed and validated in this study is valuable in assessing mental health literacy and could provide useful, essential information on the topic. It thus appears to be a promising tool in the promotion and improvement of mental health and early intervention of mental health problems among adolescents. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: One of the community-based interventions for increasing mental health literacy is mental health first aid (MHFA) training. The current study measured literacy regarding MHFA for eating disorders (EDs) among the youth and adolescents. Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed on those aged 16-29 years in Tehran, Iran. The sample size was 252 individuals. For data gathering, the Mental Health Literacy Questionnaire (MHLQ)‎ was used that was modified for EDs. The validity and reliability of the Persian version of the MHLQ‎ was confirmed. Data were analyzed using SPSS software. To determine the demographic variables that can predict participants’ literacy concerning EDs, logistic regression analysis was used. Results: Among the participants, 11.5 could successfully diagnose EDs, 34.5 were not at all confident in their ability to help, and 36.95 said they would not seek help if faced with a similar problem. Most of the participants selected “obtaining more information about the problems described in the ‎vignette and available services” and “listening to the problems of the ‎vignette character in an understanding way” as the correct first aid interventions. Family and friends were mentioned as the main influential people. Higher education could significantly predict the ability to correctly diagnose the disorder (P = 0.03) and help-seeking behavior (P = 0.002). Only relatives’ history of exposure to the problems described in the vignette could significantly predict higher scores in diagnosing suitable first aid (P = 0.02). Conclusion: In general, mental health literacy regarding EDs was not suitable among the participants of this study. Thus, it seems necessary to consider targeted MHFA training, particularly in the field of EDs, to provide training in an understandable language to the community and with emphasis on seeking professional services. © 2020 saeid alami.

AB  - Objectives:Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) is designed to help the general public acquire the knowledge and skills needed to respond to a person in a mental health emergency and offer support to someone in emotional distress. Through the PA Foundation's Mental Health Outreach Fellowship, 16 physician assistants (PAs) were selected to become MHFA instructors and teach the course to members of their local communities over 1 year.Methods:MHFA course evaluations, completed by course participants, were reviewed to determine the effectiveness of the PA fellows as instructors.Results:The fellows' mean evaluation instructor presentation score was 4.82 and the mean course content score was 4.75. The national mean for instructor presentation was 4.72 for presentation and 4.66 for course content. The maximum possible score in each category was a 5.Conclusions:The PAs selected for the Mental Health Outreach Fellowship were effective MHFA instructors. Benefits to having a PA serve as the instructor include positively affecting communities by increasing the public's mental health literacy, reducing the stigma associated with mental illness, increasing visibility and promotion of the PA profession, and enhancement of a PA's individual career through education and service. © 2020 American Academy of Physician Assistants.

AB  - Objectives: Internet-based psychoeducational and self-help platforms hold promise for alleviating existing help-seeking barriers and addressing the unmet needs of people with eating disorders (EDs). In this paper, we report data related to the reach, engagement, and visitor profile of Break Binge Eating, an online platform designed to provide evidence-based information and self-help strategies for people at all stages of an ED. Method: Two sources of data were presented: (a) usage data from platform visitors generated through Google Analytics; and (b) characteristics of a sample of platform visitors (n = 786). Results: In 13 months, approximately 46,311 unique users worldwide have accessed this platform, with usage rates rapidly increasing each month. Most visitors came from organic searches (when ED-related information is directly searched in a browser). Self-help content was the most accessed material, and 81% of the sample stated that their reason for accessing the platform was to get help. Sample visitors were highly symptomatic; 52% met criteria resembling a threshold ED and 87% engaged in at least one ED behavior in the past month. Across different symptomatic subgroups, ∼50% were unsure whether they needed help, ∼80% were not receiving any help, and ∼75% were highly concerned with their symptoms. Conclusion: This online platform has broad reach and is engaging its intended audience. It is an aim of this platform to improve mental health literacy, facilitate symptom recognition and improvement, and alleviate help-seeking barriers. Evaluating whether this platform is achieving its intended aims in a randomized controlled trial is the next step. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - Recent workforce trends in healthcare point to a growing need to prepare social workers capable of providing integrated behavioral health care in multidisciplinary settings serving at-risk youth. This article reports on a project that involved the development and implementation of a graduate-level social work specialization focused on integrated behavioral health practice with children and adolescents. This specialization offered targeted curriculum, interprofessional education experiences and specialized mentoring and field opportunities to second-year, advanced, clinical master’s students interested in working with at-risk children and adolescents. Outcomes and implementation processes were evaluated using a mixed methods approach. Findings included improvement of mental health literacy, a strengthening of professional social work identity and an enhanced commitment to serving youth populations. Engaging in a community of practice was identified as important for enhancing self-efficacy and professional identity. The creation of intentional communities of practice that help social workers develop skills through the engagement of targeted social practices embedded within interprofessional networks represents an important area of future study. Longitudinal research exploring the long-term impact of practice specializations on the behavioral health workforce are indicated. © 2019 Council on Social Work Education.

AB  - Background: Common mental disorders (CMDs) are highly prevalent and contribute significantly to the global burden of disease, yet there is evidence of a large treatment gap. We aimed to quantify this gap among young adults with symptoms of CMDs and examine the relationship between substance use and perceived need for care and mental health service utilization. Methods: In a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey of young Swiss adults' mental health and wellbeing, we assessed symptoms of anxiety, depression, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with widely used screening instruments and asked about participant suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, mental health-related quality of life, alcohol and drug use, perceived need for mental health care, and mental health service utilization. We used these variables to calculate the treatment gap and weighted all analyses according to the stratified sampling plan. Results: Around a quarter of young adults screened positive for at least one CMD. Participants who screened positive for anxiety and/or depression reported significantly more suicidal ideation and lifetime suicide attempts and reported worse mental health-related quality of life than participants who did not screen positive for a disorder. Women's prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms was significantly higher than men's, while men were more likely to report most types of risky drug use. Among those with a CMD, only around half perceived lifetime need for care, and less than 20% reported currently utilizing mental health services. Young adults with a CMD reporting risky weekly use of alcohol were less likely to be currently using services. Conclusion: The high prevalence of CMD symptoms could reflect a rising prevalence of these disorders mirroring increasing trends observed in other countries. To address the large treatment gap, interventions promoting mental health literacy and more research on additional barriers to inform further interventions are needed. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: Mental health literacy (MHL) in adolescents is an important issue as it can lead to early detection and recognition of mental illness. The aim of this systematic review was to explore the effect of supporting interventions on improving MHL in adolescents. Methods: Systematic literature review by searching the ScienceDirect, Scopus, PubMed, Crochrane and CINAHL databases. Seven of 1107 papers were included in the final review. Results: Supporting interventions for improving MHL in adolescents could be categorised into school-based and community-based. Both types used an education stand-alone strategy or an education plus contact-based group in their programmes. To provide knowledge of mental illness to adolescents, teaching methods should be interactive and use various media such as group discussion, videos and movies. Conclusions: School-based and community-based interventions were likely to improve MHL among adolescents. However, further research with objective tool measures is needed to confirm the findings. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - This investigation reviews the effectiveness of anti-stigma interventions employed at educational institutes; to improve knowledge, attitude and beliefs regarding mental health disorders among students. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) checklist guidelines were followed and protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42018114535). Forty four randomized controlled trials were considered eligible after screening of 104 full-text articles against inclusion and exclusion criteria. Several interventions have been employed to tackle stigma toward psychiatric illnesses, including education through lectures and case scenarios, contact-based interventions, and role-plays as strategies to address stigma towards mental illnesses. A high proportion of trials noted that there was a significant improvement for stigma (19/25, 76%), attitude (8/11, 72%), helping-seeking (8/11, 72%), knowledge of mental health including recognition of depression (11/14, 78%), and social distance (4/7, 57%). These interventions also helped in reducing both public and self-stigma. Majority of the studies showed that the anti-stigma interventions were successful in improving mental health literacy, attitude and beliefs towards mental health illnesses. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Culturally responsive, strengths-based early-intervention mental health treatment programs are considered most appropriate to influence the high rates of psychological distress and suicide experienced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth. Few early intervention services effectively bridge the socio-cultural and geographic challenges of providing sufficient and culturally relevant services in rural and remote Australia. Mental Health apps provide an opportunity to bridge current gaps in service access if co-designed with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth to meet their needs. Aims: This paper reports the results of the formative stage of the AIMhi-Y App development process which engaged Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth in the co-design of the new culturally informed AIMhi-Y App. Methods: Using a participatory design research approach, a series of co-design workshops were held across three sites with five groups of young people. Workshops explored concepts, understanding, language, acceptability of electronic mental health tools (e-mental health) and identified important characteristics of the presented applications and websites, chosen for relevance to this group. An additional peer supported online survey explored use of technology, help seeking and e-mental health design elements which contribute to acceptability. Results: Forty-five, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth, aged 10–18 years, from three sites in the Northern Territory (NT) were involved in the workshops (n = 29). Although experiencing psychological distress, participants faced barriers to help seeking. Apps were perceived as a potential solution to overcome barriers by increasing mental health literacy, providing anonymity if desired, and linking young people with further help. Preferred app characteristics included a strength-based approach, mental health information, relatable content and a fun, appealing, easy to use interface which encouraged app progression. Findings informed the new AIMhi-Y App draft, which is a strengths-based early intervention wellbeing app for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth. Conclusions: Research findings highlight the need, feasibility and potential of these types of tools, from the perspective of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Although research has explored stress in coaches, little is known about their mental health literacy and how this is associated with their mental health. Their mental health literacy may have an impact on the wellbeing of their young players. This study examined levels of mental health literacy, help-seeking behaviours, distress, and wellbeing, as well as relationships amongst these variables, in coaches in the United Kingdom. Coaches were recruited through social media and asked to fill out questionnaires. A total of 103 coaches (n = 65 men, n = 37 women, n = 1 other gender) participated in the study. Coaches had an average age of 27.9 (SD = 10.6) years. Most self-identified as heterosexual (n = 85, 82.5%), had four or more years of experience (n = 46, 44.7%), coached children (n = 77, 74.8%), and coached at either the beginner (n = 30, 29.1%) or amateur levels (n = 66, 64.1%). In total, 20 (19.4%) coaches indicated a previous diagnosis of a mental disorder. A total of 51 (49.5%) coaches indicated that, at the time of the completion of the survey, they exhibited symptoms of a mental disorder. Overall, the average mental health literacy score was 123.10 and lower than in previous studies. Mental health literacy was not significantly associated with help-seeking behaviour, distress, or wellbeing. General help-seeking behaviour was positively correlated with wellbeing. The results suggest that coach certification programmes could adopt strategies to help coaches improve their knowledge of mental health services and how such services may be accessed. These changes may improve the wellbeing of coaches and may benefit their athletes. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Due to the increasing numbers of newcomers with impacts of war, civil war and persecution, at high risk of trauma-related mental health problems, there is a need for increase the poor mental health literacy (MHL) and human rights among the new-comers, especially low-educated mothers with children. This article aimed to present a case study report of several years’ experience of tailor-made group health promotion intervention. It describes as an example, a project during autumn 2018 in five municipalities of Sweden and in collaboration between academia, primary care, social welfare, police, and an NGO. Fifty-one women, Arabic- or Somalian speaking, with 1–7 children, mean age 40 years, low-educated and in average four years’ of living in Sweden participated. Under supervision, a local female member of the NGO coordinated the group meetings in Swedish with up to ten participants and the moderators were representatives of healthcare, social services and police/lawyer, with an interpreter present. Each intervention focused on human rights, health including mental health, psychosocial and parenting support, by using a 5-week group intervention a 2 h/week, totally 10 h excluding pre- and post-evaluation, and one language per intervention. Each meeting included 1-h lecture and after a short break with refreshments, the participants asked questions to the respective moderator. It was a mixed method but emphasis on qualitative design and participatory methodology with co-creation and evaluation of the intervention. The results showed that this tailor-made group intervention gave the participants empowerment and a sense of coherence, MHL and tools to deal with stress/anxiety, based on their needs that were mapped before in a pilot study during Spring 2018, indirectly addressing their children. However, they did not primarily talk about mental illness experience. It is vital that these interventions toward the target group with limited exposure to Western concepts (e.g., illness, anxiety, and trauma), may bridge the gap between Western and traditional cultural understanding of pre- and postmigration stress. In conclusion, MHL may be a function of both the cultural origin of the target group’s background and their resettlement in a Western reception country. Implications are discussed. © Copyright © 2020 Ekblad.

AB  - Background: Two common barriers to help-seeking are lack of awareness of appropriate services, and low mental health literacy. The headspace awareness campaigns are designed to address these factors. Aims: To examine whether distance from a headspace centre affects community awareness of headspace, and whether general awareness of headspace changed between 2008 and 2015. Method: Responses from 4707 participants aged 12–25 years, collected in 2008 and 2015, were analysed. The effect of headspace centre location on awareness of services was assessed by comparing awareness between those living in headspace areas (within 20 km of a centre) and those who were not. Change in awareness between 2008 and 2015 was assessed. Results: Awareness of headspace and its services was significantly greater among those living in headspace areas than among those living further away. Within headspace areas, awareness increased by 27% between 2008 and 2015. Prompted and unprompted awareness were significantly greater in 2015 than in 2008. Conclusions: Awareness of headspace has increased over time; however, innovative awareness campaigns are needed for those residing in non-headspace areas. Continued funding to increase headspace’s national coverage, improving mental health literacy and service access for youth and their families, particularly those living in non-headspace areas, is needed. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: Previous research on public stigma towards people with mental disorders has mostly targeted adult samples and focused on depression, schizophrenia or mental disorders in general. Hence, the present study aimed to investigate predictors of stigmatizing attitudes towards different mental disorders (including less researched ones) in a representative sample of adolescents and young adults. Methods: Data from the Swiss Youth Mental Health Literacy and Stigma Survey were used (analytical sample: n = 4,932). Each participant was randomly presented with one of five vignettes (depression; alcohol abuse; depression and alcohol abuse combined; schizophrenia; social anxiety). The structure of stigmatizing attitudes was assessed using confirmatory factor analysis. Regression models, implemented within a structural equation framework, were used to study predictors for the identified latent variables. Results: A three-factor model for stigmatizing attitudes-consisting of 'dangerous/unpredictable', 'weak-no-sick', and 'social distance' factors-best fitted the data. Female gender was associated with less stigmatizing attitudes. Associations in opposite directions with different latent factors were found for educational and migration background. Exposure to mental disorders (being personally affected, personally having received professional help or knowing someone close who has received treatment for a mental disorder) was either not or was negatively associated with stigmatizing attitudes. In contrast, current mental health symptoms (heightened levels of psychological distress, problematic alcohol use) were generally not or were positively associated with stigmatizing attitudes. Even though the included predictors had some predictive value, the variance explained by the models was rather small (the adjusted R2 varied between 0.03 and 0.26). Conclusions: The current study indicates that contact with someone who has received treatment for a mental disorder might be an important component of programs aiming to decrease stigmatizing attitudes towards people with mental disorders, since this exposure variable predicted lower levels of stigmatizing attitudes. Furthermore, the findings suggest that target-group interventions for specific subgroups need to be considered, as the process leading to stigmatizing attitudes towards people with mental disorders appears to differ between specific sociodemographic subgroups. © © 2020 Dey et al.

AB  - Background: With the rapid development of information technology and mobile devices, an increasing number of mobile medical services and platforms have emerged. However, China’s current mental health situation necessitates further discussion and research on how to provide more patient-centered services in the face of many challenges and opportunities. Objective: This study aims to explore the attitudes and preferences of mental health service stakeholders regarding mobile mental health services and discuss the challenges and opportunities faced by mobile technology developers in China. Methods: A web-based survey was conducted by following the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys (CHERRIES) checklist. A total of 586 valid questionnaires were collected. Respondents included 184 patients or their family members, 225 mental health professionals, and 177 people from the general population. Data analysis was completed using SPSS 24.0. Results: Among the various problems perceived regarding the current mental health medical environment, difficulty in finding appropriate psychologists and limited visit times ranked highest. Social media (n=380/586, 64.9%) was the most preferred platform among all participants, whereas professionals showed a higher preference for smartphone apps (n=169/225, 75.1%). Professional instruction, psychological consultation, and mental health education (ranked top 3) were the most commonly identified needs. Mental health professionals generally emphasized more on treatment-related mobile mental health service needs, especially medication reminders (χ2<inf>2</inf>=70.7; P<.001), symptom monitoring (χ2<inf>2</inf>=24.0; P<.001), and access to mental health resources (χ2<inf>2</inf>=38.6; P<.001). However, patients and their family members focused more on convenient web-based prescriptions (χ2<inf>2</inf>=7.7; P=.02), with the general population interested in web-based psychological consultation (χ2<inf>2</inf>=23.1; P<.001) and mental health knowledge (χ2<inf>2</inf>=9.1; P=.01). Almost half of the participants regarded mobile mental health services as highly acceptable or supported their use, but less than 30% of participants thought mobile mental health services might be very helpful. Concerns about mobile mental health mainly focused on information security. Service receivers also suspected the quality and professionalism of content, and mental health professionals were worried about time and energy consumption as well as medical safety. Conclusions: In terms of service flow, mobile services could be used to expand service time and improve efficiency before and after diagnosis. More individualized mobile mental health service content in more acceptable forms should be developed to meet the various needs of different mental health stakeholders. Multidisciplinary training and communication could be incorporated to facilitate the integration and cooperation of more well-rounded service teams. A standard medical record system and data format would better promote the development of future intelligent medical care. Issues such as ensuring service quality, solving safety risks, and better integrating mobile services with regular medical workflows also need to be addressed. © Yuxi Tan, Ziwei Teng, Yan Qiu, Hui Tang, Hui Xiang, Jindong Chen.

AB  - Purpose: Suicide is a leading cause of death among U.S. youth aged 12–18 years. Youth Aware of Mental Health (YAM), a promising, universal, school-based mental health promotion/suicide primary prevention intervention for adolescents, has been evaluated in Europe but not in the U.S. The present study used an uncontrolled, pretest/post-test design to document the potential for YAM to reduce suicidal ideation, attempt, and suicide. A demonstration that help seeking behaviors, mental health literacy, and mental health stigmatizing attitudes improve after the intervention would suggest that the program is promising in the U.S., as well as in Europe, and that further investigation is merited. Methods: YAM was delivered to 1,878 students in 11 schools as part of regular school curricula. A subset of these students (n = 436) completed surveys before and 3 months postdelivery. Surveys included five questions about help seeking behaviors, a measure of intent to seek help (General Help Seeking Questionnaire), two mental health literacy scales, and two mental illness stigma scales (Reported and Intended Behavior Scale and Personal Stigma and Social Distance Scale). Both McNemar's test and repeated measures linear models were used to determine whether the survey outcomes changed after YAM delivery. Results: Among the 436 adolescents (286 and 150 in Montana and Texas, respectively), significant increases were found pre- to post-intervention in three of five help seeking behaviors, along with improved mental health literacy and decreased mental health-related stigma. Intent to seek help was unchanged. Conclusions: Several help seeking behavioral factors, mental health knowledge, and stigma improved post-YAM intervention. All three domains are likely protective against suicide. A randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of YAM in preventing suicidal behaviors is warranted. © 2020 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine

AB  - Background: Increasing rates of mental health problems among adolescents are of concern. Teens who are most in need of mental health attention are reluctant to seek help. A better understanding of the help-seeking in this population is needed to overcome this gap. Methods: Five databases were searched to identify the principal barriers, facilitators and interventions targeting help-seeking for common mental health problems in adolescents aged 10-19 years. The search was performed in June 2018 and updated in April 2019. Two independent screening processes were made using the eligibility criteria. Quality assessment of each study was performed, and findings summarised using a narrative synthesis. Results: Ninety studies meet the inclusion criteria for this review for barrier and facilitators (n = 54) and interventions (n = 36). Stigma and negative beliefs towards mental health services and professionals were the most cited barriers. Facilitators included previous positive experience with health services and mental health literacy. Most interventions were based on psychoeducation, which focused on general mental health knowledge, suicide and self-harm, stigma and depression. Other types of interventions included the use of multimedia and online tools, peer training and outreach initiatives. Overall, the quality of studies was low to medium and there was no general agreement regarding help-seeking definition and measurements. Conclusion: Most of the interventions took place in an educational setting however, it is important to consider adolescents outside the educational system. Encouraging help-seeking should come with the increased availability of mental health support for all adolescents in need, but this is still a major challenge for Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services. There is also a need to develop shared definitions, theoretical frameworks and higher methodological standards in research regarding help-seeking behaviours in adolescents. This will allow more consistency and generalisability of findings, improving the development of help-seeking interventions and ensuring timely access to mental health treatments. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - This study evaluated the impact of “In the Know” mental health literacy training for Canadian agriculture. We hypothesized that “In the Know” would significantly increase participants’ knowledge around mental health, confidence in recognizing mental health struggles, confidence in speaking about mental health with others, and confidence in helping someone who may be struggling with mental health. “In the Know” was a 4-h, in-person program delivered by a mental health professional who also had experience in agriculture. Six sessions were offered in Ontario, Canada in 2018. Participants were farmers and/or worked primarily with farmers. A pretraining paper questionnaire was administered, followed by a post-training questionnaire at the end of the session and 3 and 6 month post-training questionnaires via email. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were performed to compare participants’ self-reported knowledge and confidence across four timepoints. “In the Know” significantly improved participants’ self-reported mental health knowledge and confidence in recognizing mental health struggles, speaking to others, and helping others who are struggling immediately following training and often at 3 and 6 months post-training. This is the first study among farming populations to measure program impact with 3- and 6-month follow-ups. Given the reported associations between mental health literacy and increased helpseeking, disseminating “In the Know” more broadly across farming communities may help to increase mental health literacy and thus increase help-seeking among farmers. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - A high prevalence of mental disorders in adolescents has been reported worldwide, but little is known about mental health literacy in this population, particularly in developing countries. The goal of this study was to evaluate mental health literacy level and help-seeking preferences in high school students in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. These two variables were also compared between students who had stress, anxiety and depression with students who did not. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 1094 students across 27 classes at three high schools. Students completed a self-report questionnaire that included validated scales such as the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21), the Mental Health Literacy Scale (MHLS) and the General Help-Seeking Questionnaire. Based on the DASS-21, the prevalence of students reporting symptoms of stress, depression and anxiety was 36.1%, 39.8% and 59.8%, respectively. The mean MHLS score was 104.12 (SD = 10.09) and was significantly lower in students who had symptoms of depression. The most common help-seeking preferences for mental illness were friends, classmates and relatives or family members. Help-seeking preferences were almost identical among students with stress, anxiety or depression. While Vietnamese high school students had high levels of symptoms of stress, depression and anxiety and moderate levels of mental health literacy, non-professionals were preferred as their first help-seeking choice. Our findings revealed the need for routine school-based mental health screening and referral activities as well as mental health education programs for high school students in Vietnam. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Children and adolescents with chronic physical health conditions are vulnerable to poor mental health outcomes. The measurement of mental health literacy of health professionals working with such populations is important because of their role in promoting early and appropriate help-seeking. This study sought to determine the beliefs regarding the causes of and risks factors for three types of mental illnesses amongst health professionals in United Arab Emirates. Method: A culturally validated mental health literacy survey presenting three vignettes of fictional characters meeting diagnostic criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder, depression with suicidal thoughts and psychosis was distributed. The survey measured health care professionals' beliefs regarding the causes of and risk factors for these disorders. Results: A total of 317 health care professional (> 90% nurses) were surveyed from across the UAE. Although 43.8% correctly endorsed exposure to a 'traumatic event' as the most likely cause for developing posttraumatic stress disorder, there was a more limited understanding of the contribution of biopsychosocial factors to the development of the mental illness, particularly for psychosis. Participant socio-demographic variables were associated with attributions of religious or spiritual beliefs and personal weakness as causal and/or vulnerability factors in the development of depression with suicidal thoughts and psychosis. Conclusions: Efforts to improve mental health systems and health care providers in UAE and other similar Middle Eastern countries requires targeted mental health literacy programs that seek to integrate biopsychosocial models of mental illness and their treatment with the positive aspects of religious and cultural beliefs that are dominant in this region. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Adolescence is a crucial period for developing and maintaining good habits for mental health and well-being. This is important for future mental health, as most mental health problems manifest during adolescence. Mental health literacy is the foundation for mental health prevention, stigma reduction, and increased help-seeking efficacy particularly among adolescents. The mental health literacy programme "The Guide", which was developed in Canada, has shown success in increasing mental health literacy in North American 16-17 year olds. "The Guide Cymru" is an adaptation of The Guide designed for a younger age group (13-14 year olds) and for the Welsh culture and context and is being offered to all state schools in Wales. Methods: This two-armed cluster randomised control trial (RCT) will evaluate the effectiveness of The Guide Cymru. All 205 secondary schools in Wales will be invited to take part, involving up to 30,000 year 9 pupils. Schools will be randomised to either the immediate implementation of The Guide Cymru or to a wait-list control. The wait-list control will receive The Guide Cymru around 12 weeks later. Measures of mental health literacy (assessed via the Knowledge and Attitudes to Mental Health scale) and mental health problems (via the PedsQL and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire) will be taken at baseline (pre-intervention), 12 weeks later (after the active group has received The Guide Cymru), and 24 weeks later (after the wait-list control has received The Guide Cymru). Discussion: The trial aims to evaluate if The Guide Cymru increases mental health literacy, including reduced stigma to others and to the self, and increased levels of good mental health behaviours and help-seeking for mental health problems.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to highlight the impacts that service user involvement can have on the education of UK undergraduate student mental health nurses both personally and professionally. It reports the findings from a short module evaluation of a collaboratively delivered theory unit using a qualitative approach. Design/methodology/approach: The study reports the findings from a short module evaluation of a collaboratively delivered theory unit using a qualitative approach embracing two focus groups. Findings: The findings from the two focus groups highlight that the service user input (expert by experience) offered a positive learning experience for the students, enabled them to appreciate the meaning of recovery and hope and facilitated the identification of the importance of their role in terms of connecting meaningfully with those they are supporting and reconsidering key priorities for practice. They also suggest that there is theory/practice gap reduction as students were able to connect the service user narratives to the evidence base for deeper understanding and application. Research limitations/implications: Although only a brief evaluation of a short theory module within a wider programme involving a small number of participants, the findings echo the wider literature and offers further rationale to support direct service user involvement within mental health education across all healthcare professions. This finding is also relevant, as, increasingly, learning/teaching programmes now seek to implement blended learning with significant online teaching and less face-to-face facilitation of learning. Practical implications: This study highlights not only the positive impact of service user input on health-care education but also the benevolent influence skilled narratives can have as a pedagogical approach to learning. Originality/value: Although there is much in the literature as to the benefits for student learning in involving service users within higher education institute education, there is limited information as to “how” and “why” this is the case, this article seeks to bridge that gap. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Objectives: A number of school-based interventions for preventing and attenuating symptoms of anxiety and depression in youth have been developed worldwide but evidence of their effectiveness is mixed. None of these curricula stem from existing children’s literature, however, the Harry Potter (HP) series has been identified as potentially imparting Cognitive Behavioural Therapy concepts. Methods: This study aimed to broadly capture, at an interim stage, the feasibility of a pilot HP curriculum aimed at imparting CBT skills to middle-schoolers in order to inform full development of the curriculum. The study design further included a non-randomized, Group (HP; Control) by Time (Baseline, Post-Intervention, Follow-up) mixed factorial approach retrospectively examining change in scores on a “Well-Being and Resiliency Survey” (WBRS) which assessed multiple symptomatic and social domains. Results: In total, 232 grade seven and eight students participated in the curriculum over two years with no dropouts. Compared to 362 controls, there were no significant differences in WBRS scores between groups at post or one-year follow-up. Conclusions: This pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of rapid and broad implementation of the intervention. Preliminary analyses showed no indication of effectiveness which may be the product of the intervention being in an interim stage during the study period and/or the retrospective design and limitations in data quality. Specifically, these results suggest that the WBRS may be a suboptimal instrument for measuring the effectiveness of this intervention. A prospective trial of the complete, revised curriculum with validated measures is required to provide an adequately assessment of its impact. © 2020, Canadian Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.

AB  - Purpose: There is a paucity of interventions for young adults who have parents with a mental health or substance use issue. The 6-week mi.spot (supportive, preventive, online, and targeted) professionally moderated, online intervention fills this gap. The purpose of this study was to present evidence of the acceptability, safety, and preliminary effectiveness of this intervention. Methods: In response to social media advertising, 31 young people aged 18–25 years participated in mi.spot. Intervention effectiveness was examined via a single-group pre, post, and 6-week follow-up study design, measuring primary changes in depression, anxiety, stress, and psychological well-being and secondary changes in coping, self-efficacy, social connectedness, attribution of responsibility, help-seeking, and mental health literacy. Acceptability and safety were determined by system use and participants' self-reports. Results: Over the 6 weeks of the intervention, 28 (90.3%) of 31 participants used one or more components of the mi.spot intervention. Significant improvements were reported in depression and stress from preintervention to 6-week postintervention. Trend improvements were evident in well-being, social connection, and coping. No change was reported in general help-seeking, social connectedness, mental health literacy, self-efficacy, or attribution. No safety violations were reported. Participants reported mi.spot to be safe and acceptable. Conclusions: mi.spot appears to be safe and acceptable and shows promise as an effective online intervention to improve the mental health and well-being of young adults with parents with mental health and/or substance use issues. © 2019 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to measure associated factors of Mental Health Literacy (MHL) among Minnesotans by using the Mental Health Literacy Scale and Andersen's Health Behavior Model. Design and methods: This study utilized cross-sectional survey data with 732 participants. Findings: Participants in higher education groups showed higher MHL levels than those who have less education. Non-Latino Whites had higher MHL levels than any other racial group. Participants who engaged in social groups had higher MHL levels. Interestingly, the relationship between health literacy and MHL was the most substantial factor. Practice implications: Interventions aiming to improve health literacy seems beneficial to increase MHL. In addition, a variety of programs should be implemented, such as social programs that target those with less social group interaction. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Objectives: The aims of this study were to assess evidence for a novel, universal mental health literacy programme in the school setting (teen Mental Health First Aid) as an intervention to improve peer support towards adolescents at risk of suicide and to examine whether participation in a school-based programme dealing with suicide was distressing to participants. Method: In a cluster randomised crossover trial, Australian high school students aged 15–17 years (N = 1605, 44.74% female, M<inf>age</inf> = 15.87) received either teen Mental Health First Aid or a matched control physical first aid course. Data were collected before, immediately after and 12 months after training through online surveys assessing correct recognition of suicidality and intentions to help a fictional peer (John) who was depicted as experiencing depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts in a vignette. Students were also asked whether any information in the training or surveys was found distressing and completed a validated measure of psychological distress (the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale). Results: Students receiving teen Mental Health First Aid training were much more likely to report an increase from pre- to post-training in recognition of suicidality (OR = 1.97, 95% CI = [1.14, 3.39], p = 0.02) and appropriate first aid intentions towards a peer at risk of suicide than students receiving physical first aid (OR = 35.40, 95% CI = [19.86, 63.14], p < 0.001). Twelve months after training, most effects were still significant. Although a greater proportion of teen Mental Health First Aid participants self-reported feeling briefly distressed after the training, there was no evidence of greater distress at 12 months on the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale. Conclusion: teen Mental Health First Aid is effective in increasing recognition of and intentions to assist a suicidal peer. Although the open discussion of mental health first aid for a suicidal peer was distressing for some students, results suggest this was transient and not associated with harm. Future studies are required to ascertain whether these increases are indeed associated with better provision of support and prevention of youth suicide. © The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists 2019.

AB  - Child mental health is a growing concern for policymakers across the global north. Schools have become a key site for mental health interventions, with new programmes aimed at promoting ‘resilience’, through which children may maintain or regain mental health during adversity. As one of the first studies to explore the early impact of intensive mental health promotion in schools from children’s perspectives, we adopt a governmentality approach to consider the logic and techniques of such programmes with a specific focus on England. An innovative visual methodology was used to focus on student perspectives of mental health interventions in school. Young peoples’ photo representations of mental health were collected and used to stimulate focus group discussions with 65 students aged 12–14, across seven schools. ‘Resilience’ was seen to be the key organising concept for mental health interventions in schools. The concept was viewed as narrowly focused on attitude towards—and performance in—school work, with individuals being encouraged to ‘push on through’ difficulties to achieve success. Young people were critical of this approach, suggesting several alternatives. These included increased access to independent mental health professionals, safe spaces within schools and mental health education that addressed the social and affective dimensions of mental health difficulties. © 2019 British Educational Research Association

AB  - Purpose: Chinese international students have been widely reported to lack recognition of their psychological problems and to delay treatment until their symptoms become rather disabling. The present study pioneered to evaluate the effectiveness of Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) training in improving mental health knowledge among Chinese-speaking international tertiary students. Method: A quasi-experimental design was adopted, whereby 202 Chinese-speaking international students in Melbourne were assigned to the MHFA condition or a control condition. All participants completed a standardized questionnaire before, at the end, and 3 months after training. Data were analyzed using multilevel modeling. Results: The findings demonstrated that MHFA training might be effective in improving participants’ knowledge of mental disorders (i.e., recognition of symptoms, belief in helpful treatments, and understanding the biogenetic and psychosocial causes) and reducing stigma. Conclusions: The MHFA program has the potential to enhance mental health knowledge and promote help-seeking among Chinese-speaking international students. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Intervention studies have rarely targeted parent mental health literacy despite its importance for adolescent mental health. This qualitative study evaluated the experiences of parents (n = 352) who participated in the Ahead of the Game mental health literacy workshop delivered through community sport clubs. Moreover, the study aimed to investigate the relevance, retention and use of intervention content by parents, assess the acceptability and feasibility of delivering mental health education through community sport clubs, and identify strategies for increased engagement. In total, 17 parents (13 mothers, four fathers) participated in semi-structured interviews up to one month after the workshop. Reflexive thematic analysis revealed that parents perceived mental health education as important and valuable, and believed the community sport club was an appropriate setting to discuss adolescent mental health. Parents reported increased awareness and knowledge of mental health disorders and help-seeking options, and increased confidence and preparedness to communicate and assist someone experiencing a mental health issue. The workshop stimulated conversation about mental health between parents and their children, and between parents within and outside the sport club community. Parents used information and resources provided in the workshop to help those in their networks and reflected back on the workshop when noticing changes in their adolescent's behavior. Potential additions to the workshop (as suggested by parents) included increased discussion among parents as well as opportunities for further information sessions or tailored online material. Future research might look to engage more fathers, actively encourage parents to aid in the recruitment of others, and investigate long-term adolescent mental health outcomes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a school-based mental health education program in preventing adolescent suicide attempts in an impoverished urban area in Peru, as part of an Official Development Assistance project by the Korea International Cooperation Agency. The PRECEDE-PROCEED model informed the effectiveness study. In this intervention, the participants were first to fifth grade students in public secondary schools. The pre-post intervention survey was conducted with a stratified random sampling method. A sample of 768 and 738 students in experimental and control groups was analyzed comparatively, using chi-squared tests and logistic regression. This study found that the program had a positive effect on adolescent mental health-related risk behaviors and suicide attempts in the experimental group compared to the control group. Thus, the intervention may have helped prevent the increase in mental health-related risk behaviors and suicide attempts. Further, parental affection, when included in the intervention, had a significant effect on suicide attempts. As such, the involvement of parental affection in the intervention might be effective in preventing suicide attempts. To enhance the effectiveness of interventions aiming to prevent adolescent suicide, the participation and attention of parents, as well as adolescents, must be encouraged. Further, to maintain the effectiveness of the intervention and expand coverage to other schools in the neighborhood, a strategy for project sustainability is needed, particularly with regards to capacity-building in schools and communities. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Introduction: Stigma can be a barrier to early intervention of severe mental illnesses, especially schizophrenia, which further leads to poor outcomes. Mental health campaigns were designed to educate the general public about signs for early identification of psychosis, but the line between schizophrenia and attenuated psychosis was not well demarcated. We wonder if people would generalize their stigmas towards schizophrenia to subjects with subthreshold psychotic symptoms. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was employed which used a structured questionnaire, comprised of four case vignettes describing attenuated psychosis syndrome (APS), schizophrenia, psychotic-like experiences (PLE), or depression, and was followed by two sets of questions using the 4-point Likert scale to measure discrimination and prejudices. Participants were chosen by convenience sampling of laypersons from different backgrounds. Results: A total of 268 subjects completed this survey. A gradient of stigmas, highest toward schizophrenia, followed by APS/depression, and lowest toward PLE was apparent across gender, all age groups, and education levels. Participants who were younger and had higher education revealed a trend of lower prejudice and discrimination. People who have visited a psychiatric hospital showed higher discrimination toward schizophrenia, APS, and depression. People who have seen mentally ill persons in public places showed lower stigma toward PLE. Discussion: Our respondents posed a differentiable attitude towards PLE, APS, and schizophrenia, while exhibiting no difference between APS and depression. Certain personal attributes were correlated with stigma levels. Further investigation about mental health literacy and attitudes towards subjects with psychotic symptoms in the general public is warranted. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd

AB  - Mental health is a key factor that affects the life and learning of students. The edutainment provides an efficient and scientific teaching method to enhance the mental health and positive behaviour of students. Based on the theory of cognitive psychology and game psychology this paper applies the edutainment into the curriculum design of mental health education based on the theory of cognitive psychology and game psychology creating a game-based edutainment teaching method. Next, the proposed method was compared with the traditional teaching method through a case study. The effect of edutainment on mental health and learning efficiency was evaluated based on the observed data. The results show that the game-based edutainment teaching method is in line with the cognitive psychology and mental features of students, and promote their enthusiasm in learning and abilities to internalize and absorb the knowledge; this method can also speed up the switch into the learning state and enhance the degree of concentration, pushing up the psychological satisfaction and psychological pleasure. The research results shed new light on the curriculum design of mental health education. © 2020 Fundacion Aigle.

AB  - Aim: Mental health problems are prevalent among young people in Malaysia yet access to specialist mental health care is extremely limited. More context-specific research is needed to understand the factors affecting help-seeking in youth, when mental health problems typically have first onset. We aimed to explore the attitudes of vulnerable young Malaysians regarding mental health problems including unusual psychological experiences, help-seeking and mental health treatment. Methods: In the present study, nine young people (aged 16–23 years) from low-income backgrounds participated in a semi-structured interview about their perspectives on mental health problems, unusual psychological experiences and help-seeking. Results: Four themes were developed using thematic analysis. “Is it that they [have] family problems?” reflected participants' explanatory models of mental health problems. “Maybe in Malaysia” was concerned with perceptions of Malaysian culture as both encouraging of open sharing of problems and experiences, but also potentially stigmatizing. “You have to ask for help” emphasized the importance of mental health help-seeking despite potential stigma. “It depends on the person” addressed the challenges of engaging with psychological therapy. Conclusions: We conclude that young people in Malaysia may hold compassionate, non-stigmatizing views towards people experiencing mental health problems and a desire to increase their knowledge and understandings. Yet societal stigma is a perceived reputational risk that may affect mental health problem disclosure and help-seeking. We suggest that efforts to improve mental health literacy would be valued by young Malaysians and could support reduced stigma and earlier help-seeking. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd

AB  - Mental health screening of athletes is of increasing concern to key stakeholders (e.g., sport administrators, psychologists, performance consultants, and coaches) at many institutions and governing bodies in the United States. Recently, Tomalski et al. (2019) described the implementation of a comprehensive collegiate student-athlete mental health screening program, including recommendations for professionals interested in replicating this program at other institutions. This excellent program involves resources and staffing that many institutions may not have. The current paper describes a variety of recommended adaptations of this comprehensive program and additional considerations to help professionals who have fewer resources or less institutional support to implement key aspects of student-athlete mental health screening. Specifically, recommendations for how to address staffing and time limitations, identify mental health providers, select screening questionnaires that maximize classification accuracy, and encourage accurate student-athlete reporting of mental health concerns are provided. Moreover, we emphasize the importance and utility of supporting mental health literacy of coaching staff as a cornerstone to effective mental health screening and intervention with collegiate student-athletes. © 2020, © 2020 Association for Applied Sport Psychology.

AB  - Literature indicates a high prevalence and burden of mental illness in youths world-wide, which may be even higher in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), such as South Africa and Zambia. Additionally, there is a lack of knowledge regarding youth depression amongst many primary health care (PHC) practitioners. The principal goal of the MEGA project is to provide youth with better access to mental health services and appropriate care, by developing a mental health screening mobile application tool to be used in PHC settings in South Africa and Zambia. In this study, we will use a mixed methods multi-center study design. In phase one, we will investigate the mental health literacy of PHC practitioners to identify areas in need of development. Based on the needs identified, we will develop and test a mobile health application to screen for common youth mental health problems in phase two. In phase three, we will implement and evaluate a tiered education and training program in the use of the m-health application. In the final phase, we will evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of the m-health application in PHC centres across South Africa and Zambia. Evidence suggests that PHC practitioners should routinely consider mental illness when assessing youth. However, common psychiatric disorders remain largely undetected and untreated in PHC settings. By identifying limitations in PHC workers knowledge with regard to youth mental health, we aspire to improve the depression care provided to youth in Southern Africa and Zambia by developing and implementing a locally relevant m-health application. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Although mental health concerns are common among children and adolescents, youth-serving adults often feel underprepared in responding to these challenges. Youth Mental Health First Aid (YMHFA) is a training program designed to teach adults how to assist youths experiencing mental health or addiction challenges. This pilot program evaluation study examined the outcomes of YMHFA associated with adult knowledge, confidence, beliefs, and behaviors. Participants included 2,180 individuals in Ohio who attended a YMHFA training between January 2015 and August 2016; most participants were White women and represented professions in the field of education. Results revealed that YMHFA participants became more confident, willing to help, aware of support and resources, and accepting of individuals with mental health conditions three months posttraining. A high percentage of YMHFA participants also reported applying YMHFA Action Steps at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the training. Demographic differences (by race, gender, age, and occupation) in the adult outcomes associated with YMHFA training did not emerge when removing the effects of other participant variables. Limitations, future directions for research, and implications for school psychology practice are discussed in this Service Delivery Brief. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Application of control theory to predict human behavior is largely based on Powers’s (1973) work, which can be traced indirectly through Carver and Scheier’s (1982) self-regulation theory and directly through interventions in areas of child development, mental health, education, and organizational psychology. Control theory proposes that behavior changes from moment to moment to keep perceived aspects of the self and world close to desired reference values – a person’s goals, standards, or ideals. Control is achieved through actions that help the individual meet their standards. Individuals can change their behavior to either cooperate or conflict with their attempts to control the same perceived aspect of the world (e.g., money, food, alcohol, drugs, medicine). Control theory is a “building blocks” theory from which working models can be built and tested and sets a new standard for empirical testing of psychological theory. This chapter reviews the evidence for each component of control theory. It describes how behavior change emerges for many different reasons, each of which can be modeled and tested. The chapter also questions whether “behavior change” itself is an appropriate, or efficient, objective. Finally, the chapter summarizes evidence for behavior change interventions informed by control theory and provides suggestions for future research and interventions using the theory. © Cambridge University Press 2020.

AB  - We examined the effectiveness of a student-initiated and guidebook-supported high school club program aimed at reducing mental-illness stigma via humanization—largely through contact—hypothesizing that stigma measures would improve across a school year and as a function of the timing of club initiation. Forty-two Northern California high schools (731 students) participated from 2015–2017. Stigma measures (Knowledge, Attitudes, Social Distance, and Positive Actions) were collected in the fall (Time 1 [T1]), winter (Time 2 [T2]), and spring (Time 3 [T3]). Schools were matched on student-body demographics, then randomized into either an immediate (23 clubs at T1) or delayed (19 clubs at T2) start. The sample was diverse regarding race/ethnicity and class standing. Across both randomized groups, measures of stigma significantly improved from beginning to end of the school year; effect sizes ranged from small to medium (d = .22–.56). The hypothesized pattern of change was partially supported: the immediate group showed significant increases from T1–T2 for Attitudes and Positive Actions; the delayed group showed a stronger increase from T2-T3 for Knowledge. Ceiling effects at baseline were salient. Baseline stigma measures were in a more positive direction than in a prior, quasi-experimental study of the same club model 5 years earlier, with effect sizes ranging from d = .32 to .88, suggesting secular trends regarding lower stigma levels. Findings support the importance of school-based interventions for reducing mental-illness stigma, particularly via student-initiated, contact-based efforts. It is possible that youth mental-illness stigma has decreased in recent years, with more sensitive measures needed in future trials.

AB  - The investigation of students' mental health and personality characteristics provide a good awareness of the main problems in the mental health of student groups, to find effective intervention measures for the psychological counseling of students and promote the mental health of students. This study selected students as the research objects and conducted investigations on their psychological symptoms, subjective wellbeing, social support, and self-efficacy. A two-factor mobility model was constructed and tested for its various fitness indicators based on the collected data, verifying the mental health two-factor mobility model's applicability in student groups. Mental health problems mainly focus on five factors of obsessive-compulsive symptoms, emotional imbalance, learning pressure, maladjustment, and interpersonal tension and sensitivity. The detection rate of the student's mental health abnormality scale for the study object is very high, and the detection rate of the moderate and severe psychological problem scale is also very high, which requires more vigilance and attention. Emotional stability, school relationships, and school adaptation have a significant impact on students, and there is a close relationship between personal behavior and mental health. The overall incidence of students' bad behavior is relatively low, and the health hazard is relatively high. Gender, emotional stability, school conditions, and school intimacy have significant effects on it. It is recommended to carry out targeted mental health education and personal behavior intervention strategies based on students' characteristics. © 2020 Sociedad Revista de Psicologia del Deporte.

AB  - Background: COVID-19 outbreak and the unprecedent measures imposed by the government, including quarantine and social distancing, cause psychological distress in children and adolescents. Methods: we review literature about mental health effects of COVID-19 pandemic by using the keywords “COVID-19”, “coronavirus”, “pandemic”, “mental health”, “psych*”, “adolescent” and “child”. Results: early evidence show high prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms in children and adolescents, due to the pandemic itself, to social isolation and to parents’ stress. High grade students, females and low-income families are at higher risk to de-velop psychiatric symptoms. Psychological distress can be reduced by maintaining contact with peers through social networks and by accurate updates provided by the government through the mass media. Online resources such as information about mental health education and preventive measure, video-counselling, telemedicine and telepsychiatry services, can be useful to reduce the psychosocial effects of the novel coronavirus. Conclusion: there is urgent need to plan new strategies for early psychological interventions in order to reduce the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on children and adolescents mental health status.

AB  - Objective: To describe nursing intervention to promote children’s mental health. Methods: This was an integrative review using PubMed, B-On, and CINAHL databases using the following keywords “health promotion”, “mental health, “child”, “nursing”, or “role of nursing” or “pediatric nursing” or “primary nursing care”, with combination of Boolean operators “AND” and “OR”. Full-text articles published in Portuguese and English within 10 years were included, after application of inclusion and exclusion criteria. A qualitative analysis with construction of three categories were included. Results: We included 15 articles describing nursing interventions for children and adolescents at school, for family and community. The majority of interventions were approach at school with an emphasis on promotion of resilience and a healthy behavior. Conclusion: The analyzed studies showed the importance of nurses to promote children’s mental health in mental health education programs, sensibilization and support to psychoaffective, biologic and social needs. A large variety of interventions organized and developed by nurses were observed at school, with families and as well as in the interrelationship with community. © 2020 Departamento de Enfermagem/Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo.

AB  - The World Health Organization emphasizes the importance of developing programs of mental health promotion and prevention to ensure the wellbeing of young people. Mental health literacy in schools is an example of universal prevention intervention. The objective of this article is to conduct a systematic review of the mental health literacy interventions in the educational setting that are being carried out at the international level and to describe and evaluate, as well, an experience at the local level. A search has been carried out in PubMed to identify experimental studies on mental health literacy interventions in the educational setting including primary and/or secondary. Out of 245 references identified, 13 experimental studies were included in the review and its quality was assessed. Results show that these programs increase mental health knowledge, improve help-seeking and reduce stigma behavior. In Barcelona, the Espaijove.net mental health literacy program has been running since 2008. In the last seven school courses (2012-2019) workshops have been provided to 24,118 secondary school students, of whom 11,678 completed a post-workshop satisfaction questionnaire. The results show that the program has been interesting, useful, has resolved students’ doubts and that they would recommend it to other students, and a better reception by the girls. © 2020 SESPAS

Students’ beliefs about the helpfulness of specific interventions for managing depression and schizophrenia were compared between the simulation cohort (n = 149) and the non-simulation cohort (n = 150) from a school of nursing in the U.S. Students in the simulation cohort showed significant increase in knowledge and acceptance of available treatment options for managing depression and schizophrenia over a one-year period. The finding supports the use of virtual simulation in undergraduate mental health nursing education with active faculty engagement. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: Due to the lack of an instrument to measure mental health literacy among Persian/Farsi speaking people, this study was conducted to examine the psychometric properties of the Persian version of the Mental Health Literacy Scale (P-MHLS). Participants and Methods: The 2019 cross-sectional study with 992 participants was conducted in Tabriz, Iran. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were performed to establish the construct validity of the P-MHLS. The internal consistency/reliability was estimated by computing Cronbach’s coefficient alpha. Feasibility of the scale was examined and item response theory (IRT) models were applied to characterize the test items. Results: An exploratory factor analysis of data resulted in five factors, which included 30 of the 35 items and accounted for 42.00% of the variance. The construct validity of the 5-factor model was supported by the results of our confirmatory factor analysis. The factors were the 1) ability to recognize mental disorders, 2) confidentiality of mental health practitioners, 3) skills of mental health information seeking, 4) beliefs about mental illnesses, and 5) attitudes toward patients with mental illness. Conclusion: The study provides initial support for the use of the MHLS among Persian/ Farsi speaking adults to assess mental health literacy. © 2020 Heizomi et al.

AB  - Improving soldiers’ resilience and recovery has always been the core of military training for all countries. Current research tends to consider stress negative, which leads to unhealthiness or unhappiness; as a result, some scholars believe that stress should be avoided or reduced as much as possible. Frankly speaking, the existence of stress is inevitable in military environments. For example, turning into a soldier from a civilian in military academy exerts great pressure on freshmen, which is necessary. In practical, the implementation of stress management courses is fragmentary and discontinuous. Such lectures focus more on theories, which could not make students truly comprehend the nature of stress. In this study, stress theory and virtual reality technology design are adopted to overcome the difficulties of current curriculum. For the stress mindset theory, some scholars believe having a stress-is-enhancing mindset will enhance physical and mental health as well as raise the happiness, while having a stress-is-debilitating mindset may cause negative effects on physical and mental health as well as decrease the happiness. Therefore, the theory of curriculum design in this study will adopt the theory of stress-is-enhancing mindset. This viewpoint emphasizes that stress mindset is a belief, and that strengthening an individual’s mentality will enhance their ability to face challenges. Through learning stress-is-enhancing mindset, military academy students can well deal with stress in the future. The course adopts a Mindset Training Program proposed by Crum [2], which includes a three-step, two-hour teaching course. In the first part, “The Paradox of Stress” introduces the possibility to make people weak or strong through the stress. In the second part, “The Power of Mindset”, the stress is specified and defined through films and examples to explain how attitudes influence individual’s psychology and physiology. In the third part, three steps to strengthen mentality are adopted. The steps aim to help new cadets adopt a positive and conscious way to strengthen mentality. The third part will include virtual reality technology, a kind of computer technology that enables participants to interact with computer-generated three-dimensional scenes. Participants can produce the same behavior and emotions as in real situations, and it takes less time. Finally, the results of this study are expected to give educators a new model for stress management, and further enhance the resilience and recovery of the military. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - The objective of this study was to examine mental health literacy (MHL) and its relationship with depression among young adolescents. Adolescents aged 12 to 14 years from forty-six schools were recruited to participate in this cross-sectional study which was conducted from August to November 2017. MHL was examined using the MHL and stigma questionnaire. The Malay version of the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D) was used to assess depression. Data were analysed using multivariable logistic regression. A total of 1707 adolescents completed the survey. Only 51 (3.0%) adolescents had adequate MHL. Majority of participants, 80% had the intention to seek help for depression, however few were able to correctly recognize depression, 3.5%. A number of 347 (20.3%) adolescents were categorized as having depression. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that adolescents with inadequate MHL were more likely to have depression (AOR = 2.24; 95% CI; 0.74, 6.80). However this finding was not statistically significant. Adolescents with no intention to seek help had higher odds of having depression (AOR = 2.31; 95% CI: 1.68, 3.18). Intention to seek help for depression, which was a component of MHL was found to be significantly associated with depression. School-based health interventions should focus on improving adolescents' MHL. © 2020, Akademi Sains Malaysia.

AB  - In a 5-year follow-up assessment, 33 students who had taken an undergraduate helping skills course indicated that they had continued to use the helping skills in both their professional lives and personal relationships. On average, there were no significant changes from pretraining to follow-up on empathy, natural helping ability, or facilitative interpersonal skills. Furthermore, although students had increased in self-efficacy for using the skills during training, on average they maintained their self-efficacy levels at the follow-up. The 15 participants who had further mental health education, however, scored higher at follow-up on empathy, natural helping ability, self-efficacy for using the skills, and facilitative interpersonal skills compared with the 18 participants who had no further mental health education (controlling for pretraining levels), suggesting that continued exposure to and practice using the skills helped them continue to improve their helping abilities. Qualitative data indicated that participants typically had positive experiences in the helping skills course. Implications for training and research are provided. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)Public Significance Statement—Participants reported that they used the helping skills in both their professional and personal lives 5 years after training, suggesting that the effects of helping skills training extend over time. Furthermore, those who pursued further mental health education continued to improve in their helping abilities more than did those who did not continue further mental health education.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the limitations, strategies, importance and obstacles in mental health education in undergraduate nursing, focused on the role of nurses in Primary Health Care. Method: An exploratory descriptive study conducted with 103 professors in the mental health area of Bachelor/ Postgraduate nursing courses from 89 public Higher Education Institutions in the five regions of Brazil. Results: Only 23.3% (24) of the professors teach mental health classes only in primary health care. Of the sample, the limitations to teaching in primary care education are few class hours (46.6%), faculty to expand teaching beyond specialty settings (38.8%), and prioritization of other scenarios (48.5%). When teaching, the strategies used are home visits (43.7%), educational actions (34.0%) and active search for mental health cases (29.1%). The professors consider them important to support mental health actions (58.3%); and the barriers are the lack of articulation between the Collective Health and Health disciplines to conduct teaching (87.5%). Conclusion: It is suggested that the institutions, courses and professors make the commitment and focus efforts to overcome the gaps, which hinder the nurse’s education process regarding primary knowledge in mental health, so that they can offer care to patients in psychological distress in the context of the community, as well as strengthen national mental health policy. © 2020, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina.

AB  - Young adults experiencing mental health problems often need both individual support and educational accommodations to successfully complete their studies. Recent research also points to the need for career-related, educational services in a labor market that increasingly demands formal education or training. The aim of this study was to investigate the development of supported education services in Sweden, in relation to pursuing educational and vocational goals. Interviews were conducted with a broad sample of stakeholders who are currently developing supported education services, as well as young adults utilizing educational support. The results suggest a number of key factors for accommodating the needs of these students which include, in addition to basic academic, mental health and individual supports, attention to economic challenges, social contexts and improved mental health literacy for educational actors. The results additionally substantiate the relevance of educational supports to long-term vocational goals when providing employment support services. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Computerized and blended treatments seem to be an attractive treatment for adolescents as an alternative to face-to-face treatment, but mental health professionals seem hesitant to use these treatment modalities. This review provides an overview of factors contributing to and withholding from using computerized or blended treatment in routine care. Three databases were searched with terms related to (1) adolescents, (2) depression, (3) computerized or blended, and (4) treatment. Of the 33 articles identified, 10 focused on unguided computerized treatments, six on guided, two on blended, two compared unguided, blended-and face-to-face treatment to no treatment, and eight studies on games. Further, two articles that were focused on an online monitoring tool and three on intervention characteristics or preferred modes of help-seeking. Evidence for effectiveness, adherence, drop-out, and forming therapeutic relations were suspected to be barriers, but are no reason to reject computerized or blended treatment. Improvement in mental health literacy and the possibility to tailor the intervention are facilitators. However, adolescents’ intention to seek help, acceptability of computerized treatment, symptom severity, time spent by therapist, and other facilities are identified as barriers and they need to be taken into account when using computerized or blended interventions. Nevertheless, computerized and blended are promising treatments for depressed youth. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - There is evidence of the effectiveness of implementing mental health literacy (MHL) programs. However, there are substantial limitations in the instruments available for measuring MHL. This study aimed to develop and validate the EspaiJove.net MHL test (EMHL) for Spanish adolescents by assessing its psychometric properties. The development of the EMHL test was conducted using item pool generation and a pilot study. A convenience sample of students aged 13–15 years (n = 355) participated in the validity study. Reliability was assessed for internal consistency and via test-retest. Convergent validity was evaluated by comparing the effect sizes among known groups with different levels of mental health knowledge, the correlation with mental health-related instruments, and the item discrimination index. A final version of a 35-item EMHL test was obtained with two parts: (i) a binary choice format (yes/no) for the identification of mental disorders; (ii) a multiple choice question with four possible answer options. Internal consistency was acceptable in the first part (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.744; Guttman’s lambda 2 = 0.773) and almost acceptable in the second part (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.615; Guttman’s lambda 2 = 0.643). The test-retest evaluation supported the stability of the test (first part, ICC = 0.578; second part, ICC = 0.422). No ceiling and floor effects were found. The EMHL test scores discriminated between known groups with different levels of mental health knowledge and it is associated with several-related constructs of MHL. Conclusions: The EMHL test is a relevant measure for assessing MHL in adolescents into Spanish context with acceptable validity and stability. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - This study aimed to systematically review the current body of research on parent and caregiver mental health literacy. Electronic databases were searched in January 2018 with 21 studies meeting inclusion criteria. A narrative synthesis of quantitative and qualitative studies was conducted. Findings across studies suggest that parents and caregivers had limited mental health knowledge. Factors associated with help-seeking included cultural and religious beliefs, financial and knowledge barriers, fear and mistrust of treatment services, and stigma. Notable limitations include non-representative samples, cross-sectional research designs, and use of inconsistent and non-validated study measures. Research would benefit from more diverse samples, an increased focus on prevention, and controlled trials of educational programmes targeting mental health literacy. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Aims. Mental disorders cause high burden in adolescents, but adolescents often underutilise potentially beneficial treatments. Perceived need for and barriers to care may influence whether adolescents utilise services and which treatments they receive. Adolescents and parents are stakeholders in adolescent mental health care, but their perceptions regarding need for and barriers to care might differ. Understanding patterns of adolescent-parent agreement might help identify gaps in adolescent mental health care. Methods. A nationally representative sample of Australian adolescents aged 13–17 and their parents (N = 2310), recruited between 2013–2014, were asked about perceived need for four types of adolescent mental health care (counselling, medication, information and skill training) and barriers to care. Perceived need was categorised as fully met, partially met, unmet, or no need. Cohen’s kappa was used to assess adolescent-parent agreement. Multinomial logistic regressions were used to model variables associated with patterns of agreement. Results. Almost half (46.5% (S.E. = 1.21)) of either adolescents or parents reported a perceived need for any type of care. For both groups, perceived need was greatest for counselling and lowest for medication. Identified needs were fully met for a third of adolescents. Adolescent-parent agreement on perceived need was fair (kappa = 0.25 (S.E. = 0.01)), but poor regarding the extent to which needs were met (kappa = −0.10 (S.E. = 0.02)). The lack of parental knowledge about adolescents’ feelings was positively associated with adolescent-parent agreement that needs were partially met or unmet and disagreement about perceived need, compared to agreement that needs were fully met (relative risk ratio (RRR) = 1.91 (95% CI = 1.19–3.04) to RRR = 4.69 (95% CI = 2.38–9.28)). Having a probable disorder was positively associated with adolescent-parent agreement that needs were partially met or unmet (RRR = 2.86 (95% CI = 1.46–5.61)), and negatively with adolescent-parent disagreement on perceived need (RRR = 0.50 (95% CI = 0.30–0.82)). Adolescents reported most frequently attitudinal barriers to care (e.g. self-reliance: 55.1% (S.E. = 2.39)); parents most frequently reported that their child refused help (38.7% (S.E. = 2.69)). Adolescent-parent agreement was poor for attitudinal (kappa = −0.03 (S.E. = 0.06)) and slight for structural barriers (kappa = 0.02 (S.E. = 0.09)). Conclusions. There are gaps in the extent to which adolescent mental health care is meeting the needs of adolescents and their parents. It seems important to align adolescents’ and parents’ needs at the beginning and throughout treatment and to improve communication between adolescents and their parents. Both might provide opportunities to increase the likelihood that needs will be fully met. Campaigns directed towards adolescents and parents need to address different barriers to care. For adolescents, attitudinal barriers such as stigma and mental health literacy require attention. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Differences in mental illness (MI) stigma among adolescents were examined cross-sectionally across race, ethnicity, and gender to identify target populations and cultural considerations for future antistigma efforts. An ethnically and socioeconomically diverse sample of sixth graders (N = 667; mean age = 11.5) self-completed assessments of their MI-related knowledge, positive attitudes, and behaviors toward peers with MI and adolescent vignettes described as experiencing bipolar (Julia) and social anxiety (David) symptoms. Self-reported race, ethnicity, and gender were combined to generate 6 intersectional composite variables: Latino boys, Latina girls, non-Latina/o (NL) Black boys, NL-Black girls, NL-White boys, and NL-White girls—referent. Linear regression models adjusting for personal and family factors examined differences in stigma using separate and composite race, ethnicity, and gender variables. In main effects models, boys and Latina/o adolescents reported greater stigma for some outcomes than girls and NL-White adolescents, respectively. However, intersectional analyses revealed unique patterns. NL-Black boys reported less knowledge/positive attitudes than NL-Black and White girls. NL-Black and Latino boys reported greater avoidance/discomfort than NL-White girls. Moreover, NL-Black girls and boys and Latina/o girls and boys wanted more social separation from peers with mental illness than NL-White girls; NL-Black boys also reported more separation than NL-White boys, NL-Black girls, and Latina girls. Finally, NL-Black boys and Latina girls wanted more distance from David than NL-White and Black girls. Vital for informing future antistigma interventions, this study generates new knowledge about how differences in views about MI exist across racial and ethnic identity, and how gender intersects with these perceptions. © 2019 Global Alliance for Behavioral Health and Social Justice
