TI  - A critical review of curriculum and pedagogy in mental health education
T2  - HEALTH EDUCATION
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Purpose - To critically examine the existing literature on mental health education in secondary schools amid an escalating youth mental health crisis, exploring which curriculum components and pedagogical approaches are most effective for adolescents' learning.<br /> Design/methodology/approach - We used a critical literature review methodology grounded in a constructivist paradigm. Systematic searches across three databases using the PICo framework yielded 176 publications for analysis. Data extraction captured explicit and implicit insights about curriculum and pedagogy from diverse publication types. Reflexive thematic analysis was conducted using Bernstein's educational theory, Freire's critical pedagogy and Kutcher et al.'s mental health literacy model as analytical lenses.<br /> Findings - We identified eight evidence-based propositions indicating that effective curriculum requires comprehensive integration of all mental health literacy components, recognition of mental health's subjective nature within sociocultural contexts, inclusion of biopsychosocial and continuum models and development of communication competencies and practical problem-solving skills. From a pedagogical perspective, the findings indicate the limitations of didactic methods while supporting multimedia integration, active learning methodologies and student-led approaches that foster critical engagement and agency.<br /> Originality/value - Despite recognition that school-based mental health education is a crucial factor in improving adolescent mental health, current approaches have been characterised as heterogenous and inconsistent, with ambiguity regarding which curriculum components and pedagogical approaches contribute to the effectiveness of interventions - a critical gap that this review addresses by offering guidance for researchers, educators and policymakers to consider in designing and delivering mental health education that enhances adolescents' mental health literacy and empowers them to improve their well-being.

TI  - Fostering Mental Health Awareness in Pakistani Adolescents: Results From a School-Based Intervention Study
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY IN THE SCHOOLS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - With significant rates of mental health problems reported among adolescents in Pakistan, it is necessary to equip them with mental health knowledge for timely detection and intervention. This study investigated the effectiveness of the Urdu version of the Mental Health and High School Curriculum Guide in improving adolescents' mental health literacy. By utilizing quasi experimental research design, a total of 316 grade nine students from three government high schools in Lahore, Pakistan were screened on Urdu Version of Mental Health Literacy Scale. From these, 122 participants who scored low were divided into intervention group (n = 61) and waitlist control group (n = 61) while being matched on gender, age and school variables to limit confounding. A total of 78 students (intervention group; n = 42 and waitlist control group; n = 36) completed the intervention and post-evaluation. Independent Samples t-test revealed that the intervention group exhibited improved mental health literacy post-intervention than the waitlist control group (t [76] = 7.70, p < 0.001, Hedges' g = 1.94). The paired samples t-test indicated significant post-intervention improvements in the intervention group's mental health literacy (t [41] = -14.48, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 2.51), mental health knowledge (t [41] = -10.11, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 1.71), and attitudes (t [41] = -4.34, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.72). This study had an attrition rate of 35.2% and the differential attrition analysis revealed no significant differences between the participants who completed the study and those who dropped out. Overall, the present study highlights the effectiveness of the guide and underscores the need for policy makers to embed such programs in educational curriculum to prevent mental health disorders and enhance community outcomes.

TI  - The DNP Collective Model: Enhancing Mental Health Literacy in Metro Detroit
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY HEALTH NURSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - PurposeThe DNP Collective is a structured faculty-Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) mentorship model developed to implement a large-scale quality improvement (QI) initiative aimed at reducing mental health disparities, enhancing early intervention skills, and strengthening doctoral nursing education. The initiative utilized Mental Health First Aid (MHFA), an evidence-based program that teaches participants to identify, understand, and respond to signs of mental illness and substance use disorders. DesignA QI design combined community-wide MHFA dissemination with structured faculty mentorship to ensure training fidelity, cultural adaptation, and reflective learning. MethodsBetween 2022 and 2024, thirteen DNP students, certified as MHFA instructors, delivered MHFA training across Michigan communities. Participants completed pre- and post-training surveys using the Mental Health Literacy Scale (MHLS). Faculty mentors ensured fidelity and cultural relevance. Paired t-tests evaluated MHLS score changes, and chi-square analyses assessed categorical variables. ResultsA total of 422 individuals received MHFA training, with 224 matched MHLS surveys. Mental health literacy significantly improved, with mean scores increasing from 130.6 to 137.7 (p < .001). The greatest gains were observed among underserved populations, particularly Hmong and immigrant participants with limited prior exposure to mental health education. ConclusionsIntegrating MHFA with structured DNP mentorship improved community mental health literacy and strengthened student leadership and project rigor. This scalable model embeds health equity and public health impact within DNP education. Clinical RelevanceFor community health nurses, these findings highlight the importance of nursing-led, culturally responsive interventions in promoting mental health literacy, early intervention, and stigma reduction across diverse populations.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Medical students face a high prevalence of mental disorders, such as depression, alongside inadequate mental health literacy (MHL). This study investigates the feasibility, and efficacy of an interactive, gamified educational program in improving participants' MHL. Method Thirty-two Iranian medical students participated in a semi-experimental pretest-post-test study. An 18-hour online program, delivered using the flipped classroom method, focused on mental health first aid, stigma, stress management, and subjective well-being (SWB) skills. Participants were evaluated before, after, and four months post-program using the Mental Health Literacy Scale (MHLS), Mental Health Promoting Knowledge (MHPK), and World Health Organization-5 Well-being Index (WHO-5). Results Participants' mean age was 22.78 ( +/- 4.54). Post-test results showed significant improvement in MHLS and MHPK scores (P-values< 0.05), which were sustained at the four-month follow-up (P-values>0.01). SWB improved in the post-test evaluation (P-value= 0.058). Conclusion The educational program effectively improved medical undergraduates' MHL and SWB. Given the rising concerns about medical students' mental health, implementing such curricula appears promising for long-term benefits.

TI  - Identifying the prerequisites, facilitators, and barriers in improving adolescents' mental health literacy interventions: A systematic review
T2  - JOURNAL OF EDUCATION AND HEALTH PROMOTION
M3  - Review
AB  - The present study aimed at identifying the prerequisites, facilitators, and barriers to adolescent mental health literacy interventions. To that end, databases PsycINFO, Science Direct, Scopus, Emerald, PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were systematically searched, out of which 39 articles that had the inclusion criteria were analyzed by the content analysis. Databases searched from September 30, 2018, to October 10, 2018, with the keywords "health literacy," "mental health literacy," "mental disorders," adolescents, students, and more. Seven themes were identified as the prerequisites for interventions to improve adolescents' mental health literacy including education at the school level, parents' education, training of trainers and providers, cooperation and participation among providers, intervention assessment and monitoring, provision of educational content, consideration of the cultural and linguistic issues. Five themes were identified as facilitators: using interactive learning and teaching methods, supplying diverse and stimulating educational content, employing trainers with different backgrounds, having direct contact with people with mental illness, and utilizing technological advancements in education. Finally, short-time intervention, the collaboration between school administrators and researchers, lack of valid information sources were identified as barriers.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Adolescence is a critical period for developing and maintaining good habits for mental health and well-being. This is crucial for future mental health; as most mental health problems emerge during adolescence. Mental health literacy forms the foundation for preventing mental health issues, reducing stigma, and enhancing the effectiveness of help-seeking, particularly among adolescents.Objective: This study aims to measure the effect of social media-based educational intervention on mental health literacy among male high school students in Ramhormoz city.Methods: This randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluated the effectiveness of a social media-based intervention, designed around the core components of The Guide training package. The study involves all high schools in Ramhormoz city using a stratified random sampling method. A total of 204 students are expected to participate. Measures of mental health literacy and attitudes towards seeking professional psychological help are evaluated at three time points: before the intervention (baseline), 3months, and 6months after the intervention.Results: We anticipate a significant improvement in the mental health literacy score of the intervention group compared to the control group at post-intervention and both follow-ups. Additionally, we expect a substantial enhancement in the attitude towards seeking professional psychological help score for the intervention group compared to the control group at post-intervention and 6-month follow-up, though not at the 3-month follow-up.Conclusion: In conclusion, this study will contribute valuable insights into the effectiveness of social media-based interventions in enhancing mental health literacy and attitudes towards seeking professional help among high school students. The results will guide future initiatives in mental health education and promotion.Clinical trials: This study protocol is registered with the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT) under the registration number IRCT20230603058372N1, dated June 5, 2023. The study adheres to the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines, as outlined in Supplementary File S1.

TI  - Mental Health Concerns in Individuals With Developmental Disabilities: Improving Mental Health Literacy Trainings for Caregivers
T2  - INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Although approximately a third of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) also experience a mental health concern, caregivers often miss early identification of these issues. In this perspective piece, we present an outline for a mental health literacy program that can enhance existing training approaches for caregivers of individuals with IDD. We describe three processes of the Mental Health Awareness and Advocacy (MHAA) curriculum and detail how it provides a strong preventative model to train caregivers to increase their mental health literacy. In describing these processes, we provide illustrative examples and conclude by providing a brief vignette that highlights how this process could be used by caregivers to help reduce mental health concerns in individuals with IDD.

TI  - A qualitative evaluation of a mental health literacy intervention for parents delivered through community sport clubs
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY OF SPORT AND EXERCISE
M3  - Article
AB  - Intervention studies have rarely targeted parent mental health literacy despite its importance for adolescent mental health. This qualitative study evaluated the experiences of parents (n = 352) who participated in the Ahead of the Game mental health literacy workshop delivered through community sport clubs. Moreover, the study aimed to investigate the relevance, retention and use of intervention content by parents, assess the acceptability and feasibility of delivering mental health education through community sport clubs, and identify strategies for increased engagement. In total, 17 parents (13 mothers, four fathers) participated in semi-structured interviews up to one month after the workshop. Reflexive thematic analysis revealed that parents perceived mental health education as important and valuable, and believed the community sport club was an appropriate setting to discuss adolescent mental health. Parents reported increased awareness and knowledge of mental health disorders and help-seeking options, and increased confidence and preparedness to communicate and assist someone experiencing a mental health issue. The workshop stimulated conversation about mental health between parents and their children, and between parents within and outside the sport club community. Parents used information and resources provided in the workshop to help those in their networks and reflected back on the workshop when noticing changes in their adolescent's behavior. Potential additions to the workshop (as suggested by parents) included increased discussion among parents as well as opportunities for further information sessions or tailored online material. Future research might look to engage more fathers, actively encourage parents to aid in the recruitment of others, and investigate long-term adolescent mental health outcomes.

TI  - Effectiveness and Implementation Outcome Measures of Mental Health Curriculum Intervention Using Social Media to Improve the Mental Health Literacy of Adolescents
T2  - JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY HEALTHCARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Globally, adolescent mental health problems reportedly manifest more severely in individuals with lower mental health literacy. Mental health curriculum interventions using social media have been associated with positive implementation outcomes. This study aimed to investigate whether such an intervention significantly improves adolescent mental health literacy and is associated with positive implementation outcome measures.Methods: This study employed a quasi-experimental design, comparing the before-and-after difference between the intervention group (n(1)=77) and the control group (n(1)=76). A mental health literacy module was delivered using social media. Data were collected using validated questionnaires. Effect size and difference-in-differences model calculations (and associated 95% confidence intervals, CI) were conducted alongside other descriptive analyses.Results: The estimated intervention effect size and difference-in-differences estimates were greater than zero. The effect was greater in the intervention than in the control group (p<0.05) despite sex and age differences. The effect size estimate provided by Cohen's d and Hedges' g values was medium-to-large (d/g=0.429-0.767, p<0.05). The difference-in-differences reflected a significant effect (DID=0.348, CI: 0.154-0.542, p<0.001) in increasing mental health literacy despite differences associated with sex, age, and school grade. The intervention program was acceptable, appropriate, feasible, and satisfactory, and more than 80% of participants said they agree to completely agree with these implementation outcomes. Resources and personal and family-related factors were among the perceived influencing factors determining the effectiveness and implementation outcome measures.Conclusion: The intervention program effectively improved the mental health literacy of adolescents. It has been highlighted that social media interventions for mental health promotion could be practical and scalable; however, there is a need to take into account socio-demographic differences and barriers to inclusion/compliance.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Secondary school students are at risk for mental health problems, especially nowadays, when we face an increase in mental health issues among adolescents and the general population. Mental health literacy (MHL) and help-seeking behavior are considered protective factors; however, we lack data on the levels of MHL in secondary school students and how MHL is developed in schools. This correlational and comparative study was designed to investigate mental health literacy (MHL) and help-seeking behavior among secondary school students in Slovakia. A convenient sample of 250 Slovak secondary school students responded to an anonymous online survey consisting of two scales (Mental Health Literacy Scale and Self-stigma of Seeking Help). Significant differences in mental health literacy (t(248) = 5.56; p <= 0.0) and stigma of seeking help (t(248) = -4.33; p <= 0.01) were observed between students in general and vocational secondary school. Students in general secondary school who attended optional psychology courses had the highest scores in mental health literacy (U = 987; p = 0.003). These preliminary findings showed that secondary students with a higher level of mental health literacy reported a lower level of self-stigmatization related to seeking professional mental health help (r = -0.339; p <= 0.01). Implementing mental health education into secondary school curricula can potentially help increase mental health literacy and decrease self-stigma of seeking help.

TI  - The effect of intervention based on adapted mental health literacy curriculum on attitude and help-seeking intention in high school students in Iran
T2  - JOURNAL OF EDUCATION AND HEALTH PROMOTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background:Adolescent mental health is a major public health concern in Iran, with 1 of every 5 adolescents suffering from a mental disorder. Mental health literacy (MHL) is an important factor in improving mental health outcomes. To address this issue, a mental health literacy school curriculum used in Canada was adapted, piloted, and evaluated for use in Iranian schools. This study examines the impact of the intervention on the attitude and help-seeking intentions of first and secondary students in Iran. Materials and Methods:This study is semiexperimental research that was conducted on 200 female teenagers who were studying in girls' secondary schools in Saveh, Central part of Iran, in 2023. The participants were divided into two groups, namely, the intervention group and the control group. Both groups completed a valid and reliable questionnaire that assessed their attitude and help-seeking intention at two different time points. To evaluate the intervention's effects, a repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used. Results:The study used the repeated-measures ANOVA to assess the changes in the mean attitude and help-seeking intention scores between the intervention and control groups. The findings indicated significant improvements in the attitude of help-seeking (P < 0.001), informal help-seeking intention (P < 0.001), and formal help-seeking intention (P < 0.001) for the intervention group as compared to the control group during the study. Conclusion:The adapted mental health literacy school curriculum has been used and evaluated for the first time in Iran, and it has shown a significant increase in attitude and help-seeking intention among first and secondary female students. These results need to be confirmed by further studies, which should also analyze the interrelationships between different dimensions of mental health knowledge and help-seeking practices. Keywords for this study include mental health literacy, help-seeking, attitude, and female students.

TI  - Feasibility and Acceptability of a Classroom-Based Mental Health Literacy Program: An Australian Pilot Study
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the escalating concern surrounding mental health issues among school-age children, this study evaluated the benefits, feasibility, and acceptability of the Open Parachute mental health literacy program, designed to foster mental health skills through classroom instruction. This study asked 37 Australian educators, spanning primary to secondary school, to report on their experiences with the Open Parachute program. 50 percent of participants reported the program improved student mental health literacy and support skills, with 89% of educators intending to use the program again and 92% reporting they would recommend it to a colleague, demonstrating high feasibility and acceptability. Educators reported that they observed greater skill use, and gains in emotional regulation and empathy, in primary students compared to secondary school students. The findings of this study provide preliminary evidence for the utility of the Open Parachute program and the potential benefits of universal early mental health literacy instruction in school.

TI  - Effectiveness of school-based Scaling up Teen Mental Health Program through peer synergy (SUTMP) on mental health promotion, mental health literacy, and resilience among senior secondary students of Sikkim, India- A cluster randomized controlled trial protocol
T2  - MENTAL HEALTH & PREVENTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Mental health conditions are a significant burden during adolescence, with up to 50 % starting before age 14. Suicide is among the top three causes of death in this age group, highlighting the need for effective mental health interventions. Objective: The primary objective of the study is to determine the effectiveness of school-based Scaling up Teen Mental Health Program through peer synergy (SUTMP) on mental health literacy among senior secondary students. Methods: A cluster randomized controlled trial will be conducted among the students of government senior secondary schools. The intervention comprises five modules focusing on mental health literacy, mental health promotion, peer synergy on first aid in mental health, strengthening resilience, and the fifth module focuses on relaxation exercises, meditation and deep breathing techniques, and mindfulness with 'Teen mental health app.' Students will be assessed using the Resilience Scale, Mental Health Promotion Knowledge Scale, Peer Mental Health Stigmatization Scale, Teen Mental Health Literacy Scale, and Peer Synergy on Mental Health First Aid Scale. Assessment will be done before the intervention, one week after, at three and six months post-intervention. Expected results: The anticipated outcome of the study is that the school-based Scaling up Teen Mental Health Program (SUTMP) will increase mental health literacy among school students, strengthen their resilience skills, and increase the use of a peer-led approach for providing initial mental health first aid. Conclusion: The study will employ an innovative module for delivering the intervention, integrating on-site and app-based approaches in a blended manner.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to provide a group music therapy intervention for elementary and middle school students with mood disorders through music therapy. To explore the improvement of group music therapy on the dysphoria and state of adolescent patients with mood disorders and to explore the relationship with self-identity. A music activity-based mental health education curriculum was designed based on the results of the current survey, while two homogenous classes were selected as the experimental and control classes; subsequently, the experimental teaching of the music activity-based mental health education curriculum was conducted in the experimental class, and the regular school mental health education curriculum was conducted in the control class, and the pre- and postexperimental scale tests were used to analyze that the curriculum of this study had a positive effect of this study's curriculum on elementary school students' positive emotions analyzed through pre- and postexperimental scale tests. The music activity-based mental health education program had a significant positive effect on the overall level of positive emotions of elementary school students, especially in the positive emotion index, happiness index, mental toughness, goal focus, and interpersonal assistance factor. The positive psychology-oriented music activity-based mental health education curriculum is well suited for elementary and middle school students, especially for upper elementary and middle school students. The music activity-based mental health education curriculum realizes the value of applying positive psychology to mental health education efforts at the elementary school level and flexibly uses a variety of related theories to promote positive emotional experiences for elementary and middle school students.

TI  - Development of a Proposal for a Program to Promote Positive Mental Health Literacy among Adolescents: A Focus Group Study.
T2  - International journal of environmental research and public health
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Over the last years, there have been several studies that have shown insufficient levels of adolescents' mental health literacy (MHL). Knowledge about intervention programs that promote positive mental health literacy (PMeHL) among adolescents is still very scarce. In this sense, we defined as objectives to identify and describe the necessary components to design a program proposal that promotes adolescents' PMeHL. We conducted an exploratory, descriptive, qualitative study using two focus groups in July and September 2022 with an intentional non-probability sample of eleven participants (nine professional experts and two adolescents). Data were analyzed using content analysis, using NVivo 12 software (version 12, QRS International: Daresbury Cheshire, UK). We obtained a total of four categories and eighteen subcategories: structure (context; format; contents; length and frequency; pedagogical methods; pedagogical techniques; resources; denomination), participants (target group; program facilitators), assessment (timing; evaluation instruments), other components (planning, articulation and adaptation; involvement; training; special situations; partnerships; referral). The perspectives of the professional experts and of the adolescents that we obtained from this study contributed to the design of a proposal for a program to promote adolescents' PMeHL.

T2  - JOURNAL OF EVALUATION IN CLINICAL PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - RationaleMental health literacy enables adolescents to acquire information that will accompany them in their future lives and to define their attitudes and behaviors.Aims and ObjectivesThis study evaluated the Turkish validity and reliability of the Universal Mental Health Literacy Scale for Adolescents (10-14 years).MethodsThis is a methodological, correlational, cross-sectional, and descriptive study. The study was conducted with 223 adolescents. Data were collected by 'Information Form' and 'Universal Mental Health Literacy Scale for Adolescents.' Exploratory Factor Analysis, Confirmatory Factor Analysis, and Pearson Correlation analysis were used to assess the validity and reliability of the UMHL-A.ResultsItem Content Validity Index (I-CVI) scores ranged from 0.94 to 0.96, while the Scale Content Validity Index (S-CVI) was 0.95. For 'Help-seeking and Stigma dimensions' chi 2/df = 3.347, NFI = 0.804, IFI = 0.854, TLI = 0.778, CFI = 0.849, RMSEA = 0.103. For 'Knowledge of Mental Health and Knowledge of Mental Illnesses dimensions' chi 2/df = 1.959, NFI = 0.731, IFI = 0.847, TLI = 0.774, CFI = 0.837, RMSEA = 0.066. The internal consistency and time stability were affirmed by a Hotelling T-square value of 15.241 and an F-test result of 27.793.ConclusionsThis study reveals that the Turkish validity and reliability of the Universal Mental Health Literacy Scale for Adolescents is a valid and reliable tool for assessing mental health literacy among adolescents. The UMHL-A scale is a valid tool to evaluate critical aspects of mental health literacy in adolescent populations and can be used in both research and clinical practice in mental health education and intervention. It is recommended that the Turkish version of the Universal Mental Health Literacy Scale should be used to determine resilience in adolescents.

TI  - Compassion Fatigue Rounds (CFR): A Proactive Brief Intervention to Introduce Mental Health Awareness in a Veterinary Clerkship
T2  - JOURNAL OF VETERINARY MEDICAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The mental health and well-being of veterinary students and graduate veterinarians is a critical area of concern. Veterinary students experience high levels of psychological distress, particularly during transitional periods such as clinical training. While mental health interventions typically target pre-clinical years, the unique challenges faced by clinical students are often overlooked, resulting in inadequate support during important periods of professional development. To address this gap, Compassion Fatigue Rounds (CFR) were introduced. CFR is a proactive, integrated intervention within one clinical clerkship program. The rounds address compassion fatigue, burnout, and self-care practices through a small group discussion facilitated by the clinical instructor. An evaluation of CFR was conducted through anonymous online student surveys administered between March and September 2023. Following CFR, students self-reported an increase in knowledge, confidence, and preparedness regarding the mental health challenges in veterinary medicine. Students overwhelmingly reported positive experiences, pointing to the potential effectiveness of CFR in educating, engaging, and supporting clinical students on mental health well-being. This study offers preliminary evidence for integrating mental health education into the clinical year curriculum and serves as a practical guide for clinical instructors.

TI  - School-Based Mental Health Education: Program Effectiveness and Trends in Help-Seeking.
T2  - International journal of environmental research and public health
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - One of the strategies to address the persistent youth mental health crisis is school-based educational programming. This paper reports on two distinct studies regarding Coming Up for AIR, a school-based mental health education program: (1) program effectiveness, measured as gains in student mental health literacy; and (2) trends in help-seeking behavior before, during, and after the pandemic. A survey on program content was administered to assess program effectiveness. Data collected between 2020 and 2023 from four schools yielded 473 responses. A comparison of pre- and post-scores demonstrated statistically significant gains in program content. Mental health literacy improved across gender and grade level (8th, 9th, and 10th), as well as for students with prior exposure to a mental health curriculum. In the second study, help-seeking behavior was evaluated before, during, and after the pandemic. While other programs measure intention, Coming Up for AIR measures actual behavior as students can ask for help for themselves or a friend. Data did not reflect individual student responses, but rather were aggregated and provided the number of students per presentation who requested help. Archived declaration card data from January 2019 through February 2024 was accessed, representing 28 different schools and 16,289 middle and high school student responses. School-level data were analyzed by grade level (middle school or high school) and date (pre-, intra-, or post-COVID-19). Significant differences in self-referral were found for both grade level and presentation date. Self-referrals were significantly higher post-COVID-19 compared to pre-COVID-19 with middle schoolers increasing 90% and high school students increasing 36%. Analysis of friend referrals showed a significant difference for grade level, but not presentation date. Again, middle school students were more likely to make a referral than high schoolers. The data suggest that the mental health crisis in middle school students persists at an alarming rate. Schools are at the forefront of addressing mental health issues for youth. External educational programming can bring awareness to mental health concerns and promote help-seeking in youth.

TI  - A survey on the relationship between mental health literacy and beliefs toward mental illness among nurses in general hospitals in Turkey
T2  - ARCHIVES OF PSYCHIATRIC NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: The study aimed to determine the relationship between general nurses' mental health literacy and beliefs toward mental illness. Method: The study involved 285 nurses aged 23 to 47 from three hospitals in western Turkey, who completed the Mental Health Literacy Scale (MHLS) and the Beliefs Toward Mental Illness Scale (BMIS) between December 2023 and March 2024. Results: Those who received training on mental illnesses as students (t = 2.115, p = 0.018), those who had moderate knowledge about mental illnesses (F = 8.177, p < 0.001), those who were willing to receive training on mental illnesses (t = 1.673, p = 0.048), those who encounter individuals with mental illness in their work units (F = 11.233, p < 0.001) and those who care for individuals with mental illness in their work units (t = 1.808, p = 0.036) have higher mental health literacy levels. There was a negative relationship between nurses' negative beliefs toward mental illness levels and their mental health literacymental health literacy levels (r = -0.432, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Mental health literacy is a crucial element in reducing general nurses' negative beliefs about mental illnesses. Th & imath;us, psychiatric mental health nurses can actively prevent negative beliefs and increase awareness by providing mental health education to general nurses. Awareness programs should be accorded greater emphasize on individuals who are not trained in mental disorders when they are students, those who have low knowledge about mental disorders, those who are reluctant to receive training on mental disorders, and cohorts of nurses who are likely to encounter patients with mental disorders in their respective work units.

AB  - BackgroundBecause the majority of mental illnesses develop early in life, effective preventative public mental health interventions are needed. Interventions fostering mental health literacy can be used to enhance personal resources and capacities to facilitate mental health care and thus, address help-seeking barriers. A Canadian mental health literacy school curriculum was adapted, piloted, and evaluated for the use in German schools. The study presents the interventions effects on mental health knowledge and help-seeking efficacy among 10th grade students in Germany.Methods10th grade students (aged 14-17years old) from one secondary school participated in a pre- and post-intervention control group study. Both groups completed a questionnaire at two time points assessing mental health knowledge and help-seeking efficacy. Repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to evaluate the interventions effects.ResultsData from 188 students was eligible for analysis. The analysis of the baseline data reveals a high comparability of the two groups in terms of demographics, and initial mental health knowledge and help-seeking efficacy scores. ANOVA results showed significant improvements for the intervention group having a large effect size for mental health knowledge (f=0.574, p Copyright: CC BY 4.0

TI  - An Assessment of the Training Program on Mental Health for Community Health Workers in Kashmir, India.
T2  - Revista de cercetare si interventie sociala : review of research and social intervention
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - In recent years mental health has emerged as a major health threat in low income countries like India. In response, mental health care has been integrated into primary health care, in turn creating a rising demand for trained and skillful mental health professionals. This study was conducted in district Budgam (J&K), India with the aim of providing training to community health workers (CHWs) and measuring the change using pre- and post-training evaluations. The pre and post tests were undertaken, assessing changes in mental health literacy at three different points of time: pre-training, post-training, and three month follow-up. Mental health literacy was assessed using the interviewer-administered Mental Health Literacy Survey. The training intervention was a five-day course based on a facilitator's manual developed specifically for community health workers in India. A total of 25 community health workers from rural areas of Budgam District (mostly Integrated Child Development Service supervisors), Health Educators and Anganwadi Workers, were engaged for the study. Findings demonstrate that the training course improved participants' ability to recognize any mental health disorders. There was a clear distinction between the level of awareness pre- and post- training. The results were statistically significant on various domains Ability to recognize disorders (Pre-post P= 0.001), Knowledge of the professional help available (Pre-post p= 0.000), Attitudes that promote the recognition or appropriate help-seeking behavior (Pre-post p= 0.000) (p<0.05). Further follow up after three months was done. The mixed findings from this study, suggesting the training course has potential to improve some aspects of mental health literacy among the CHWs, including their understanding of various mental health problems.

TI  - Effectiveness of mental health literacy intervention and contact-based education on knowledge, attitude, and stigma towards mental health among secondary school students in Chennai, South India: A cluster randomized controlled trial
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Global trends indicate a rise in mental health disorders among youth, prompting need for effective interventions. Mental health literacy interventions have demonstrated benefits such as improved knowledge, treatment understanding, help-seeking behaviors, and stigma reduction. This study aimed to assess the impact of a comprehensive mental health literacy program on knowledge, attitudes, and stigma related to mental health among secondary school students in Chennai. Methods: Cluster-randomized controlled trial was conducted among students from four secondary schools. Randomization was at cluster level to minimize contamination. Participating schools provided consent, and all ninth-grade students were invited to participate. Written informed consent was obtained from parents/guardians, and assent was obtained from students. There were no specific exclusion criteria, except for students who declined to participate. Analyses were performed using intention-to-treat principles, with multiple imputation for missing outcome data. Results: After adjusting for cluster effects, the intervention group showed a significant improvement in attitude scores compared to the control group (mean difference 0.85, 95 % CI: 0.32-1.39, p = 0.002). However, no significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of knowledge and stigma. Conclusion: The findings suggest that delivering a mental health literacy curriculum alongside contact-based education involving individuals with lived experiences of mental disorders positively influences students' attitudes toward mental health. Although no significant changes were observed in knowledge and stigma levels, the integration of mental health literacy programs with personal narratives from those with lived experiences holds promise for addressing mental health stigma and promoting positive attitudes among school students.

TI  - Teaching mental health in the classroom: A mixed-methods implementation evaluation of a mental health literacy program in elementary schools
T2  - MENTAL HEALTH & PREVENTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Mental illnesses are the largest disease burden for adolescents, affecting 20 % of youth in Canada. As mental health needs arise earlier and with greater prevalence, it is essential to work upstream and prepare youth before psychological distress emerges. When implemented in the classroom as part of the educational curriculum, Mental Health Literacy (MHL) fulfills these goals as a universal response to the societal and development stressors experienced by youth. The aim of this implementation evaluation was to explore the experience of educators delivering the Elementary Mental Health Literacy Resources (EMHLR) during a 4-month period across Canada. The specific objectives were to identify the individual (educator) and organizational (district) level barriers and facilitators to delivery of the EMHLR to improve future implementation of the program. Methods: An explanatory sequential design used data from an existing feedback survey and qualitative data was gathered from group interviews with Educators. Findings were integrated using the RE-AIM framework to identify barriers and facilitators and develop considerations for implementation Results: System level barriers included the pre-existing stigma around mental health, competing priorities for classroom time, and cultivating buy-in from leadership. Individual level barriers included the time and knowledge to teach MHL. The flexible design of the EMHLR curriculum and specific implementation strategies were seen as facilitators. Mental Health Literacy offers language for youth to communicate about their experience clearly and accurately. Conclusion: The EMHLR curriculum offers an evidence-based and adaptable means to build the MHL of youth across Canada. This holds potential for improving youth mental health but requires intentional implementation strategies to be successful.

TI  - Assessing the efficacy of the 'Bicho De 7 Cabeças' B-learning school-based program in enhancing mental health literacy and reducing stigma
T2  - BMC PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The prevalence of mental disorders in adolescents has a considerable impact on daily life, restricting tasks and diminishing overall quality of life while potentially leading to stigmatization. This study aims to measure the impact of a mental health literacy intervention program, called "Bicho de 7 Cabecas" project, in b-learning format, on the increase of knowledge and the decrease of stigma in young people from Povoa de Varzim, in Portugal. A quasi-experimental study was conducted, from November 2022 to May 2023, involving an experimental group ("Bicho de 7 Cabecas" protocol) and an active control group (informational brochures), utilizing a pre-test/post-test design. Mental Health Literacy Measure-MHLM, Mental Health Promoting Knowledge Scale-MHPK-10, Mental Illness Knowledge Schedule-MAKS, Reported and Intended Behaviour Scale-RIBS, and Community Attitudes toward People with Mental Illness-CAMI were used. A total of 504 young students from the 9th grade enroll in this study, with a mean age around 14 years old. There is a significant difference between stigma (p <.001) and knowledge (p <.001) scores at baseline and follow-up. The results of this study shows that interventions aimed at young people for the promotion of mental health literacy and stigma reduction are needed and more initiatives should be implemented in schools to address these problems.

TI  - Qualitative evaluation of a sports-based mental health literacy program for adolescent males
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY OF SPORT AND EXERCISE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: This study aimed to understand adolescent males' experience of participating in a sports-based mental health literacy intervention (Help Out a Mate), and provide insight into their perceptions of the effectiveness and implementation of the program.Method: Thirty-three adolescent males (12-15 years old) who had recently participated in Help Out a Mate took part in six focus groups. Inductive thematic analysis was used to analyse focus group data, and a number of strategies were employed to enhance the trustworthiness of this account, including peer debrief, grounding in examples, and prolonged engagement.Results: These data indicated that these adolescent males broadly had a positive experience of Help Out a Mate and reported that the program was effective in terms of mental health literacy outcomes including increased knowledge of mental health, and increased confidence and intentions to seek and provide help. Delivering the program in the context of sport was reported as engaging, and preferable to delivery in a school context. Whilst some adolescents reported reductions in stigmatising attitudes following the program, others expressed a maintenance of these attitudes, suggesting addressing stigma remains a challenge for mental health literacy workshops. Further, adolescents reported that the program could be improved by including more practical activities and better group management by facilitators.Conclusions: These findings identify important insights into adolescent males' perspectives of the effectiveness and importance of Help Out A Mate as a sports-based mental health literacy intervention, and suggest a number of strategies for improving participation and engagement.

TI  - Teaching hospitality and tourism students' strategies for recognizing and supporting mental health conditions and crises in industry: an exploratory study
T2  - JOURNAL OF TEACHING IN TRAVEL & TOURISM
M3  - Article
AB  - By addressing the academic imperative for mental health education and crisis intervention, this exploratory study evaluates the desirability and availability of undergraduate education in recognizing and supporting mental health conditions and crises in hospitality and tourism industry settings. Hospitality and tourism management faculty and undergraduate students were surveyed through an online survey. The majority of faculty and students agreed mental health is important to learn in the classroom to prepare for industry, yet the majority have neither taught nor learned about mental health education and crisis intervention. The findings contribute to how educational leadership influences mental health training integration in classroom instruction. Recommendations included conducting feasibility studies with hospitality management educators on the integration of mental health in classroom learning; conducting larger, more generalizable studies on the effects of such education; and integrating effective mental health and crisis intervention training for hospitality management educators and students into curricula across the field.

TI  - Enhancing medical student training during psychiatry clerkship through a school-based mental health approach: a qualitative study.
T2  - Korean journal of medical education
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - PURPOSE: This study evaluated a school-based mental health program within a psychiatry clerkship to enhance medical students' competencies in mental health literacy, empathy, communication, and adaptability. The program aimed to bridge theoretical knowledge with practical skills through experiential learning in a real-world, community-based setting.METHODS: The study utilized convenience sampling to select 32 medical students from the 2023-2024 psychiatry clerkship cohort. Four focus group discussions, each lasting 60-90 minutes, provided qualitative data, which were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis in Atlas.ti (ATLAS.ti GmbH, Germany) to identify themes related to professional development.RESULTS: Five key themes emerged, highlighting significant gains in context-sensitive communication, empathy, and mental health literacy specific to adolescent issues. The students reported increased clinical confidence, enhanced resilience through psychological techniques such mindfulness and motivational interviewing, and benefited from sustained engagement and peer support, fostering collaboration and stress management.CONCLUSION: The school-based mental health program enhanced essential competencies in mental health literacy, empathy, communication, and practical skills for medical students. By integrating experiential learning into medical education, the program addressed training gaps, equipping future healthcare providers with the skills necessary for holistic and patient-centered mental healthcare across diverse clinical settings. The approach showed potential for broader applications in medical education to prepare students for comprehensive mental health support skills.

T2  - CHILD PSYCHIATRY & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This controlled trial evaluated the effectiveness of a mental health literacy intervention for parents delivered through community sport clubs. In total, 540 parents (321 females, 219 males) of adolescent athletes participated in a brief educational workshop on youth mental health (n = 352) or a community-matched control group (n = 188). Generalised linear mixed models revealed no significant improvements in the intervention group compared to control in the primary mental health literacy outcomes, at 1 month follow-up. However, parents in the intervention group were more likely to seek formal help for themselves, had increased confidence and knowledge to help someone experiencing a mental health disorder, experienced reduced psychological distress, and perceived more support from other parents in their sport club, relative to the control group. Overall, the findings suggest that a brief educational intervention delivered through community sports clubs can positively affect some components of parents' mental health literacy.

TI  - Enhancing warning signs of mental health literacy: Evaluating a digital base intervention for health profession students
T2  - ARCHIVES OF PSYCHIATRIC NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Despite its importance, Mental health literacy (MHL) among nursing and other health profession students often remains inadequate, potentially impacting their future roles as healthcare providers. This inadequacy can lead to delayed or inappropriate care for individuals with mental health concerns, perpetuating adverse outcomes and increasing the burden on healthcare systems. Aim: To evaluate a digital-based intervention designed to enhance the warning signs of mental health literacy among health profession students. Design: A quasi-experimental, one-group pretest-posttest study design was used to conduct the current study. Methods: A non-randomized trial was conducted using digital mental health literacy intervention about the warning signs of mental illness (DWS), involving a convenience sample of 493 undergraduate health profession students. Mental Health Literacy Survey About Warning Signs of Mental Illness was developed and validated to measure the participants' mental health literacy before and after the intervention. Results: Almost all Warning Signs of Mental Illness Literacy items were significantly increased from pre- to post- intervention. Both sub-sums representing the knowledge subscale (items 1 to 11) and attitude subscale (items 12 to 15) significantly increased to 4.4 (CI 3.7, 5.0) and 0.7 (CI 0.5, 0.9), respectively. Differences were more extensive and significant on the knowledge subscale items 0.4 (CI 0.3, 0.5) than on the attitude subscale mean items 0.2 (CI 0.1, 0.2). Conclusion: The DWS is an effective and easy-to-use education program for health profession students. The current study is an initial step toward building a body of knowledge about mental health literacy in the region.

TI  - Universal, School-Based Mental Health Literacy Programs for Middle School Students: A Scoping Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF SCHOOL HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - BackgroundUniversal, classroom-based mental health literacy (MHL) curricula are associated with improved mental health knowledge, attitudes, and help-seeking behaviors. Young adolescents are an ideal target given their need for and receptivity toward MHL education.MethodsWe conducted a scoping review to identify universal, school-based MHL programs primarily for students aged 10-14 years, with adequate descriptions of curriculum implementation and content, and measured outcomes.FindingsThirty-one articles describing 24 programs met the inclusion criteria. The content and educational strategies varied, with no two programs having the same curriculum. The studies show promising results for improvement in mental health knowledge, attitudes, help-seeking, and student mental health.Implications for School Health Policy, Practice, and EquityCollaborative work between educational and mental health professionals, along with rigorous study of outcomes, aiming to reach a consensus on a core MHL curriculum and best implementation practices, will advance efforts to improve MHL.ConclusionsThis scoping review confirmed that existing universal, school-based MHL programs for middle school-aged students improve mental health knowledge. The programs are diverse, and their outcomes are often challenging to compare. Ongoing study in this field to optimize design and implementation for improved effectiveness is needed.

AB  - Objective This paper presents a review of the current state of child and adolescent mental health literacy and provides current evidence of the economic impact of a pediatric mental health literacy (MHL) training program. Methods Employing a case-series-comparison design, physician referrals to urgent and specialized mental health services were linked with patient-specific information comparing referrals from MHL participants and non-participating physicians. The economic impact analysis was based on changes in the admitted referral frequency and lengths of stay for the MHL group, compared to themselves pretraining, and over the same time period compared to non-participating physicians. Results Average scheduled ambulatory admission rates per physician remained constant for trained and untrained pre-post groups. Average scheduled ambulatory admission wait time and length of stay reduced significantly post-training for MHL-trained physicians compared to pre-training and untrained physicians. In addition to reductions in length of stay, the total bed costs saving for emergency/ inpatients admission deferrals was $2,932,112 or about $20,000 per MHL-trained physician. Conclusion The estimated economic impact of the MHL training shows a substantial return on investment and supports wider implementation. The MHL training program should be a key feature of mental health reform strategies, as well as continuing and undergraduate medical education. Psychiatry Investig 2021;18(7):695-700

TI  - Impact of Mental Health Literacy on Improving Quality of Life Among Adolescents in Barcelona
T2  - CHILDREN-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Objectives: We aim to assess the effect of the Espaijove.net mental health literacy program on adolescents' quality of life (QOL). Additionally, we aim to describe their QOL and mental well-being. Methods: A multicenter, randomized, controlled trial was conducted, with pre- and post-intervention assessments and 6- and 12-month follow-ups. A total of 1032 students aged 13-14 from 18 schools in Barcelona participated in one of the three following mental health literacy (MHL) programs or were placed in a control group (CG): (1) a 1 h awareness session (G1h); (2) a 6 h MHL program (G6h); (3) a 7 h MHL program with stigma reduction (G7h). Measures: (1) Mental well-being: Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ); (2) QOL: EuroQol 5D-5L with its two parts: the EuroQol 5D-5L Index (0-1) and EuroQol 5D-5L visual analog scale (EQ-VAS) (0-100). Analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis, using data imputation methods for missing data. Intervention effects were assessed using multilevel models. Results: Baseline EQ-VAS and EQ-5D-5L index scores were 77.84 (CI = 76.77-78.91) and 0.91 (CI = 0.90-0.92), respectively. Boys reported higher QOL and SDQ scores (p < 0.001), whereas participants of foreign nationality showed lower scores in QOL (EQ-VAS; p = 0.039) and mental well-being (p < 0.001). Post-intervention, all groups (intervention and control), except G6h, showed QOL improvements. However, in the 6-month follow-up, the CG outperformed the other groups. At 12 months, G7h achieved the highest EQ-VAS scores compared to the other groups. Conclusions: MHL-based interventions improved short-term QOL but failed to sustain these improvements over time. Groups with lower QOL and SDQ scores included girls and adolescents of foreign nationality.

TI  - A Program and Session Evaluation of Student-Athletes' Experiences Participating in a Mental Illness Destigmatization Intervention
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL SPORT PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evidence-based stigma reduction interventions for student-athletes exist, but researchers have focused on assessing their effectiveness with little attention paid to understanding how participants experience such programs. The current study aimed to qualitatively evaluate a mental illness destigmatization intervention delivered to 35 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I student athletes. The program consisted of four weekly 1 hr empirically based sessions. Program-level results showed that participants increased their understanding of student-athlete mental health and identified actionable ways to combat stigma. Session-level results revealed intervention components impacted knowledge and application consistent with their theoretical underpinnings (i.e., mental health literacy). Practical guidelines based on the findings suggest stigma reduction interventions aimed at student-athletes should provide information specific to the athletic context (i.e., common symptoms experienced by athletes), consider content that moves beyond mental health literacy (e.g., contact-based interventions), and present opportunities for participants to apply what they have learned (i.e., roll play displaying empathy).

TI  - Child mental health literacy training programmes for professionals in contact with children: A systematic review
T2  - EARLY INTERVENTION IN PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Review
AB  - Aims There has been a surge in child mental health literacy training programmes for non-mental health professionals. No previous review has examined the effectiveness of child mental literacy training on all professionals in contact with children.Methods Studies were identified through a systematic literature search of the Cochrane, EMBASE, Medline, and PsycINFO databases in February 2019. The review included studies that delivered training to professionals who have regular contact with young people aged 0 to 19 in the context of their role and at least one component of mental health literacy; (a) knowledge, (b) attitudes, (c) confidence in helping, (d) intention to help and (e) actual helping behaviour. The quality of papers was reviewed using the Cochrane revised Risk of Bias Tool for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and the Integrated Quality Criteria for the Review of Multiple Study Designs for non RCTs.Results Twenty-one studies met eligibility criteria (n = 3243). There was some evidence that global and specific child mental health literacy training improved professionals' knowledge and stigma-related attitudes towards mental health. Few studies investigated the impact of training on actual helping behaviour.Conclusion There may be value in providing child mental health literacy training to professionals in contact with children, however there is a need for studies to evaluate the long-term impact of such training, particularly on subsequent access to appropriate support. Findings raise concerns about the quality of the studies reported in the systematic review and recommendations are made for future studies.

TI  - Mental Health Literacy Workshop for Youth Sport Coaches: A Mixed-Methods Pilot Study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL SPORT COACHING JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Among other responsibilities, youth sport coaches are positioned to monitor and address the mental health needs of their athletes. Despite this, there are limited interventions aimed at improving coaches' mental health literacy. Using a mixed-methods design, the aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and mental health literacy outcomes associated with a brief (75 min) workshop for youth sport coaches. Fourteen coaches (13 males, one female) completed pre- and postworkshop surveys measuring indices of mental health literacy, and 10 of these same participants engaged in a semistructured interview 1-month later. Overall, coaches who participated in the pilot workshop reported significant improvements in depression literacy, intentions to seek self-help for oneself and their athletes, and knowledge and confidence to provide help. In addition, coaches reported positive impressions of the workshop during the follow-up interviews and provided concrete examples of program content application. An important suggestion made by coaches was the need to align the workshop content to governing policy. Taken together, this pilot mental health literacy workshop for youth sport coaches shows strong promise and is ready for large-scale dissemination.

AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to present the findings of a preliminary study based on a novel structured mental health education programme - Innate Health Education and Resilience Training (iHEART) - in a cohort of secondary school adolescents in the UK.Design/methodology/approachA curriculum-based ten-week programme was delivered by trained facilitators. In total, 205 students enrolled in the study. An additional 64 participants were within an age-matched non-intervention control group. A non-randomised control mixed methodology approach was used. All students, pre- and post-programme, completed a quantitative questionnaire - the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Survey. Qualitative measures were used to assess participants' perceptions of changes in their resilience and mental well-being.FindingsThose who received the intervention showed a small improvement in mental well-being relative to those who did not, with a similar change in resilience. Qualitative findings regarding impulse control and emotional resilience provided positive findings.Originality/valueiHEART may be a promising new intervention offering a step change in mental health education for improving resilience, mental well-being and the ability for participants to navigate psychological challenges.

TI  - THE CORE CONNECTORS INITIATIVE: DEVELOPMENT OF A YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CHILD YOUTH & FAMILY STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper provides an overview of the development and field test evaluation of a group-based youth mental health promotion program known as the Core Connectors Initiative (CCI). CCI is a program that aims to help youth gain mental health knowledge and peer support competencies, and reinforce positive help-seeking behaviour. The purpose of the study was to evaluate and refine CCI by examining whether it attains its training objectives of mental health literacy, gatekeeper training, and fostering positive youth development, while exploring helpful and unhelpful participant experiences of the program. CCI was field tested during the latter half of the 2017/2018 school year at 3 different locations: a private school, a community centre, and a public school. Using mixed methods, the evaluation yielded information on the strengths and areas of growth for future program development. The quantitative data were collected from a sample of 29 youth, while the qualitative data were collected from 9 youth using the Enhanced Critical Incident Technique. The converging data highlight the importance of connection, the value of critical mental health literacy, and the importance of clarifying expectations. The lessons learned from implementing this program can be applied to other youth mental health promotion programs.

TI  - Process evaluation of Ahead of the Game: Underlying mechanisms of a sports-based mental health literacy intervention
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED SPORT PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This study comprises a process evaluation, examining the implementation of the athlete component of a sports-based mental health literacy intervention, Ahead of the Game (AOTG). We investigated the mechanisms driving intervention outcomes, as well as intended and unintended effects. Twenty-three adolescent males (ages 12-17) who had recently participated in Help Out a Mate and Your Path to Success were invited to partake in dyads (n = 4) or focus groups (n = 5). We used reflexive thematic analysis to analyse the data. Participants reported improvements in knowledge of depression and anxiety literacy, perceived importance of help-seeking, greater confidence to seek help and support peers experiencing mental health difficulties, alongside shifts in language, attitudes, and willingness to have conversations about mental health. Unintended outcomes included trickle-down effects; participants reported that the program benefitted those who did not engage with AOTG. Participants also described strengthened team cohesion through shared learning experiences and vulnerability. These findings highlight the need for evaluating brief mental-health literacy programs in sports settings, given that benefits may extend beyond intended effects of the program, whilst remaining acceptable, feasible, and sustainable. We suggest strategies and key takeaways to improve participation, engagement, and implementation of sports-based mental health literacy interventions.

TI  - Mental health literacy as a moderator: association between psychological vulnerability and adolescent anxiety
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Adolescent anxiety's underlying mechanisms remain unclear, which undermines adolescents' social functioning. This study examined the moderating role of mental health literacy in the relationship between adolescent anxiety and psychological vulnerability. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 1,591 middle and high school students through online questionnaires in January 2023 in Guizhou Province, China. The Psychological Vulnerability Scale, Mental Health Literacy Scale, and Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders were used to measure psychological vulnerability, mental health literacy, anxiety, and its five dimensions, including panic/somatic, generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, social phobia, and school phobia in adolescents, respectively. Results: Psychological vulnerability was significantly correlated with adolescent anxiety and its dimensions (p < 0.05). The moderating role of mental health literacy on the relationship between psychological vulnerability and adolescent anxiety was left marginally significant (p = 0.07). Furthermore, mental health literacy significantly weakened the relationship between psychological vulnerability and social phobia (p < 0.05). The upward trend of anxiety as psychological vulnerability increases among the high mental health literacy group was significantly slower than the low mental health literacy group. Conclusion: Those findings suggest educators should develop curriculum resources to strengthen the cultivation of mental health literacy among adolescents to promote adolescent mental health.

TI  - Tailored Mental Health Literacy Training Improves Mental Health Knowledge and Confidence among Canadian Farmers
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluated the impact of "In the Know" mental health literacy training for Canadian agriculture. We hypothesized that "In the Know" would significantly increase participants' knowledge around mental health, confidence in recognizing mental health struggles, confidence in speaking about mental health with others, and confidence in helping someone who may be struggling with mental health. "In the Know" was a 4-h, in-person program delivered by a mental health professional who also had experience in agriculture. Six sessions were offered in Ontario, Canada in 2018. Participants were farmers and/or worked primarily with farmers. A pre-training paper questionnaire was administered, followed by a post-training questionnaire at the end of the session and 3 and 6 month post-training questionnaires via email. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were performed to compare participants' self-reported knowledge and confidence across four timepoints. "In the Know" significantly improved participants' self-reported mental health knowledge and confidence in recognizing mental health struggles, speaking to others, and helping others who are struggling immediately following training and often at 3 and 6 months post-training. This is the first study among farming populations to measure program impact with 3- and 6-month follow-ups. Given the reported associations between mental health literacy and increased help-seeking, disseminating "In the Know" more broadly across farming communities may help to increase mental health literacy and thus increase help-seeking among farmers.

TI  - Mental health literacy interventions for female adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - EUROPEAN CHILD & ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Review
AB  - Suicide and self-harm are a leading cause of death globally, with females aged 15-24 years being a high-risk group requiring urgent intervention. Promoting mental health literacy is a well-established strategy for early intervention. No review has explored the available interventions promoting mental health literacy for female adolescents and their reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance as a whole remains unknown. This study reviews existing interventions promoting mental health literacy in female adolescents. Searches included original peer-reviewed articles from inception to May 2024 across six databases, identifying twelve studies for review. Five independent meta-analyses were conducted, showing no significant effects immediately post-intervention for mental health literacy, knowledge, stigmatising attitudes, and help-provision. A significant reduction in stigmatising attitudes was found > 6 months post-intervention. Moderation analyses could not be performed due to insufficient data. None of the included studies reported on interventions specifically for female adolescents. This review also evaluated reporting of RE-AIM components, finding limited reporting on reach, adoption, and maintenance. These findings highlight a substantial gap in high-impact and tailored mental health prevention and promotion interventions for female adolescents. Therefore, there is a clear need to understand and target female adolescents' mental health literacy needs to develop and implement more effective interventions.

TI  - Effectiveness of a comic book intervention on mental health literacy among adolescents and youth in Burkina Faso: a randomized controlled trial protocol
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIn Burkina Faso, nearly half of the population is under 15 years old, and one in four adolescents experience depression. This underscores the critical need to enhance mental health literacy among adolescents and youth, empowering them to manage their mental well-being effectively. Comic books offer an engaging approach to health education, yet their effectiveness in addressing mental health remains largely untested. Our study aims to fill this gap by evaluating the effectiveness of comic books in enhancing mental health literacy among adolescents and young adults aged 10-24 years.MethodsWe will recruit 2,007 participants aged 10-24, stratify them by age, and randomly assign them to three groups (1:1:1): a comic book intervention group (Intervention 1), a text-only flyer group (Intervention 2), and a control group with no intervention. The primary outcome will be mental health literacy and secondary outcomes will include anxiety, depression, and intentions to cope.DiscussionWe hypothesize that the comic book intervention and flyer intervention will prove more effective in improving mental health literacy than the control group. We further hypothesize that for younger adolescents (10-14), the comic book will be more effective at increasing mental health literacy than the flyer. Conversely, we hypothesize that the flyer will be more effective in increasing mental health literacy for older adolescents (15-24). Our study will provide evidence on novel interventions designed to enhance mental health literacy among adolescents and young adults in low-resource settings.Trial registrationThis trial has been registered on the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS), with the registration number DRKS00034242.

TI  - Hope therapy brings hope: an empirical study of a curriculum intervention to enhance school adaptation of Chinese high school freshmen
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Adolescents often face significant school adaptation challenges during the school transition period, which may negatively affect their academic performance, emotional well-being, and long-term development. However, research on school adaptation interventions remains limited, especially in applying hope therapy within large-scale, curriculum-based models in the Chinese high school context. This study examined the empirical effects of an 8-week mental health intervention curriculum based on hope therapy in enhancing school adaptation with Chinese freshmen high school students. A pretest revealed that the natural stabilization time for freshmen school adaptation was the ninth week after enrollment. A subsequent formal intervention experiment used a pre- and post-test randomized group control design to divide 444 students into matched experimental and control groups. The experimental group participated in eight psychological intervention sessions based on hope therapy, and the control group received regular mental health lessons. Results showed that the experimental group's hope level and school adaptation significantly increased after the intervention, not only exceeding those of the pre-intervention level, but also significantly higher than those of the control group. Cross-lagged modeling results further revealed that hope levels at earlier time points significantly predicted subsequent school adaptation, while the reverse effect was not significant. These results collectively support the validity and applicability of hope therapy in improving adolescents' school adaptation, and provides innovative and alternative intervention perspectives and practice guidelines for high school mental health education, with a strong focus on raising youths' hope to develop meaningful lives.

TI  - Mental health literacy among adolescents in Nigeria exposed to a school-based multidimensional intervention
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE CANADIAN ACADEMY OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: It is crucial to prioritize mental health (MH) promotion among adolescents, as the initial onset of mental illnesses commonly occurs during this developmental stage. Adopting a multi-pronged approach to mental health literacy (MHL) may help promote adolescent mental well-being. Objective: We aimed to determine baseline adolescents' knowledge and attitudes on mental illness and any changes following a multidimensional MHL program. Method: A pre-post study was conducted among 600 adolescents in grades 10-12 recruited by multistage sampling in southwest Nigeria. MHL training was implemented using multidimensional tools which included peer-led education, MH booklets, posters, and role plays over a six-week period. Pre-and post-intervention questionnaire data on the knowledge and attitudes of respondents on MH issues were collected and analyzed. Results: Of 600 students, 594 (99%) [mean age of 14.87 (SD 1.44), a range of 11-21 years, and a female: male ratio of 1.3:1] completed the study. Post-intervention there were significant improvements in some but not all domains assessed. Participants' views on care seeking and willingness for friendship improved post-intervention with a significant reduction in the concern for personal safety as a reason for unwillingness for friendship. Mean knowledge scores significantly increased from 11.89 (SD 2.56) to 13.51 (SD 2.62). Conclusions: The findings suggest that school-based multidimensional interventions may improve MHL. However, additional studies are needed to more rigorously assess their impact to inform effective integration of MHL into school curricula to enhance adolescent MHL.

TI  - Evaluating a Sport-Based Mental Health Literacy Intervention in Australian Amateur Sporting Adolescents
T2  - JOURNAL OF YOUTH AND ADOLESCENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Youth amateur sporting environments present an untapped, under-researched, and potentially vital avenue for targeted mental health intervention programs. This study evaluates such an intervention in 12 sporting clubs, comprising of 330 Australian youth aged 12-15 years (M = 13.73, SD = 0.79). Mental health literacy, help-seeking intentions, and help-seeking behaviors were measured throughout the season using a repeated-measures experimental-control design. Multilevel modelling revealed the intervention successfully improved mental health literacy and help-seeking intentions in particular cohorts, such as youth scoring low in these constructs pre-intervention and youth who had not previously received the intervention. This study demonstrates the efficacy of interventions to effect positive change in amateur sporting youth, highlighting a convenient method to improve mental health in young people.

TI  - Climate change and mental health: postgraduate psychology student and program coordinator perspectives from Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand
T2  - AUSTRALIAN PSYCHOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveThere is growing evidence that climate change can negatively impact people's mental health. Therefore, it is important for psychologists to receive adequate training in this area. However, little is known about current levels of training, including the amount of climate change mental health education within postgraduate psychology programs in Australia and Aotearoa-New Zealand.MethodTwo cross-sectional surveys regarding climate change and mental health were emailed to postgraduate psychology programs in Australia and Aotearoa-New Zealand. The first invited participation from program coordinators (n = 17), the second students (n = 159). We conducted quantitative content analysis and thematic analysis of qualitative responses.ResultsMost participants believe this is an important topic of training for psychologists as climate change will impact the mental health of their clients. Further, results indicate minimal climate change mental health content in postgraduate psychology training programs in Australia and Aotearoa-New Zealand.ConclusionsIntegration of climate change mental health education into postgraduate psychology curriculum will work towards equipping the emerging mental health workforce to address this growing demand, which in turn can improve mental health outcomes in a changing climate.What is already known about this topic: Climate change negatively impacts mental health in several ways.These impacts will increase as climate change increases.Climate change mental health education is not currently an Australian Psychology Accreditation Council or New Zealand Psychologists Board Accreditation Committee requirement for postgraduate psychology programs.What this study adds: This is the first study to investigate the perceptions of students and program coordinators regarding climate change mental health, and education on this topic within postgraduate psychology programs in Australia and Aotearoa-New Zealand.We found that: Almost all participants believe that climate change will negatively impact the mental health of their clients and most participants believe climate change and mental health education ought to be incorporated into programs, however the majority indicated it is not presently included.It is important to prepare the emerging psychology workforce in mental health and climate change and integrating education into postgraduate psychology programs represents a step forward.

TI  - An evaluation of a mental health literacy program for community sport leaders
T2  - MENTAL HEALTH & PREVENTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Community sports coaches and leaders can have an important role to play as informal resources for sporting adolescents and adults at risk of mental ill-health. Supporting coach mental health literacy using programs has potential to enhance opportunities for coach-player support. This study aimed to evaluate a community sport mental health literacy program and its capacity to improve club leader confidence to support and refer (primary outcome), awareness of resources, beliefs about mental health and stigmatizing attitudes (social distance). A cluster-randomized controlled evaluation was conducted with measures taken at baseline (around 2 weeks prior to intervention), immediately post-program and at a nine-month follow up. Twenty-five community Australian Rules Football clubs from metropolitan and regional centres were sampled and matched by size and location. Coaches or sport leaders (n n = 265) were randomized by club to either the intervention group or a waitlist control group. A multivariate analysis of variance (pre-test scores as covariates) revealed participants in the 'Tackle Your Feelings' (TYF) program reported improved outcomes compared to controls on measures tied to leader confidence to support and refer, knowledge of resources to support mental health, general help-seeking and stigmatizing attitudes tied to social distance. A fifth measure of beliefs about mental illness was not impacted by the program. A nine-month comparison group follow-up indicated some decay in scores over time. The results suggest that TYF programs can be effective at improving coach mental health literacy in community sporting club contexts.

T2  - TRANSCULTURAL PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the knowledge and beliefs about attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) between first-generation Chinese Canadian and European Canadian parents, and to evaluate the efficacy of an existing translated ADHD information resource to improve their ADHD literacy. A community sample of 28 first-generation Chinese Canadian and 28 European Canadian parents of elementary school-aged children completed questionnaires measuring ADHD knowledge, treatment attitudes and perceived stigma, both before and after reading an informational pamphlet about ADHD. Compared with European Canadian parents, Chinese Canadian parents initially had less knowledge and more stigma about ADHD but had greater increases in knowledge and medication acceptability after passive psychoeducation. For both groups, passive psychoeducation increased ADHD stigma, but did not impact the already high acceptability for parent training intervention. Passive psychoeducation can improve mental health literacy among ethnic minority groups, but further work needs to tailor resources to address specific gaps in mental health literacy and recognize the need for concurrent stigma-reduction methods.

M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: This study aimed to assess the impact of mental health literacy education on the beliefs and attitudes of family physicians in Turkey regarding mental illnesses. Method: This study, conducted using a pre-test post-test experimental design with experimental and control groups, involved 461 physicians from 95 Family Health Centers in Kayseri, Turkey. Both experimental and control groups were administered pre-tests, followed by online mental health training for the experimental group, and then post-tests were conducted. Data were collected using the "Personal Information Form," "Mental Health Literacy Scale," "Beliefs toward Mental Illness Scale," and "Community Attitudes toward the Mentally Ill Scale." Results: Data from 184 physicians were analyzed, the educational intervention significantly improved mental health knowledge (p=0.032), help-seeking adequacy (p=0.043), and positive attitudes (p=0.032), while reducing perceptions of danger (p=0.043) among the intervention group. The study indicated significant enhancements in mental health knowledge and help-seeking adequacy among primary care physicians in Turkey following online mental health literacy education. However, its impact on beliefs and attitudes towards mental illness is comparatively modest. Further research is necessary for a deeper analysis of the relationships between these dimensions. Discussion: Mental health literacy education positively influences primary care physicians' knowledge and help-seeking behaviors regarding mental illnesses, although it has a relatively modest impact on their beliefs and attitudes. There is a need for further research to conduct a more in-depth analysis of the relationships between the dimensions of beliefs and attitudes towards mental illnesses in mental health literacy education.

T2  - SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - School-age children frequently present with mental health (MH) problems in school, affecting their academic experience and outcomes. However, school staff report difficulty in identifying and managing such problems. We aimed to determine whether a mental health literacy (MHL) intervention was effective at improving MHL for staff in an urban, predominately Latinx elementary school. A pre/post quasi-experimental design was used. A 20-week MHL intervention that is comprehensive (i.e., not disorder specific) and tiered (i.e., universal as well as targeted services for those with greater needs) was provided as part of an existing school-based mental health prevention and promotion program. A survey adapted from validated measures of MH knowledge and attitudes (including self-efficacy and stigma), as well as use of student support services, was simultaneously administered to staff at the intervention school and a matched comparison school before and after the intervention. Linear and logistic regressions assessed whether changes in MHL and rates of MH referrals varied by school. After controlling for pre-intervention scores, staff in the intervention school had significantly higher knowledge scores (data), higher self-efficacy scores (data), and lower stigma scores (data) in the post-intervention period compared to the comparison school. Following the intervention, more staff in the intervention school reported utilizing student supports to discuss student needs (OR 5.8, 95% CI 2.3-14.6). This intervention, which utilizes a social-ecological framework and tiered approach, led to improvements in MHL of school staff, which may facilitate staff ability to identify and support students' MH needs.

M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The present study aims to evaluate the contribution in terms of the Mental Health First Aid program's effectiveness in mental health literacy about depression, based on a sample of nursing students when entering and integrating into the course. Method: A pre-experimental design with a single group design, pre- and post-intervention assessment was used. The program lasted one day (9 hours). The study sample consisted of 100 students from the 1st year of the Nursing course (in the integration to the course), having been selected in a simple random way using the software random. org. The average age was 18.54 years (SD = 2.00 years). For data collection, we used the Mental Health Literacy Assessment Questionnaire, applied to depression, the short version of the Beliefs about Mental Illnesses Inventory, and the Personal Stigma Assessment Scale. We calculated summary statistics, McNemar and Student's t-tests for paired groups, and measures of effect size, the g, and d, respectively. Results: An increase in mental health literacy was observed with the recognition of depression and communication strategies for providing first aid (p < .05), specifically in the adequacy and usefulness of valuing symptoms and not expressing judgments, as well as a reduction in stigmatizing attitudes about disorders and patients (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Despite the limitations related to the design used, namely the lack of a control group, the results indicate that the frequency of the program contributes to increase mental health literacy about depression and reduce the stigma associated with mental health problems.

AB  - PurposeTo summarize the effect of mental health first aid (MHFA) on paramedics and medical nursing students and provide direction to future training and research.MethodsSeven databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, China Knowledge, Wanfang, and China Biomedical Literature Database, were searched for relevant studies from database establishment up to January 31, 2023. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the quality of randomized controlled trials, qualitative studies, and single-armed trials on the basis of the literature evaluation criteria developed by the JBI Center for Evidence-Based Healthcare in Australia. Mixed-sex studies were assessed by using the mixed-methods assessment tool (MMAT 2018).ResultsThe review identified 11 studies that met the criteria, most of which reported on the effects of MHFA training in terms of mental health literacy (referred to as MHL), MHFA intentions and confidence, stigma, and changes in social distance. A few studies analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of MHFA training courses, motivation to complete MHFA, barriers and facilitators to MHFA training, and participants' perceptions of implementing MHFA training.ConclusionsThe MHFA curriculum is practical for healthcare workers and medical nursing students. In the future, a standardized training program based on the population characteristics of healthcare workers and medical nursing students must be developed to standardize the measurement of outcome indicators to reflect the effectiveness of implementing the MHFA training curriculum. Our study has been registered to PROSPERO under registration number CRD42024519793.

TI  - Intergenerational Transmission of Mental Health Literacy and Its Mechanism: The Mediating Effect of Parent-Child Relationship and the Moderating Effect of School Mental Health Service
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY RESEARCH AND BEHAVIOR MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Adolescents' mental health literacy is a topic of growing interest and studies have begun to explore the factors that influence adolescents' mental health literacy. This study investigated the relationship between parents' mental health literacy and adolescents' mental health literacy, as well as the mediating roles of parent-child relationship, and the moderating roles of school Methods: Questionnaires were distributed to adolescents and their parents at two time points with an interval of one month. In the first survey, 835 parents completed a mental health literacy scale and a parent-child relationship scale. In the second, 841 adolescents completed a school mental health service questionnaire and an adolescent mental health literacy assessment questionnaire. A total of 617 paired data points were matched (parents' age: M = 40.47, SD = 5.10; adolescents' age: M = 13.34, SD = 0.99). Results: Bootstrapping results showed that parents' mental health literacy was positively associated with adolescents' mental health literacy. In addition, parent-child intimacy mediated the relationship between parents' mental health literacy and adolescents' mental health literacy. School mental health service moderated the relationship between parents' mental health literacy and parent-child intimacy and adolescents' mental health literacy. Conclusion: Intergenerational transmission of mental health literacy from parents to adolescents and its conditions were revealed. These findings provide new insights for the intervention of adolescents' mental health literacy, and may lead future research to investigate the role of parents within the family context, as well as the influence of home-school cooperation on adolescents' mental health literacy.

TI  - An Intervention for Mental Health Literacy and Resilience in Organized Sports
T2  - MEDICINE & SCIENCE IN SPORTS & EXERCISE
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeIn this study, we tested the effectiveness of a multicomponent sports-based program aimed at promoting early intervention, help seeking, and resilience among a sample of adolescent male sport participants. MethodsThe Ahead of the Game program comprised four intervention components and a messaging campaign. Two components targeted mental health literacy, intentions to seek and provide help, and resilience among adolescent boys. A mental health literacy program for parents and a coach education program to assist in the support of athletes' psychological needs were also included. We evaluated the program using a nonrandomized controlled trial matching two regional communities. In total, 350 sport participants (mean, 14.53 yr) were included in an intervention group, whereas 466 (mean, 14.66 yr) received usual practice in a matched control community. One hundred and eighty parents or caregivers and eight coaches also participated in the intervention components. Between-group mean differences on the primary and secondary outcomes were analyzed using linear mixed models, adjusted for clustering at club level, participant age, and socioeconomic status. ResultsSignificant positive group-time interactions were found for the primary outcomes of depression and anxiety literacy, intentions to seek help from formal sources, confidence to seek mental health information, and resilience. We also found a significant positive group-time interaction for the secondary outcome of well-being. There were no group-time interactions for social distance (stigma), intentions to seek help from informal sources, implicit beliefs about adversity, perceived familial support, or psychological distress. ConclusionsGiven the high rates of sport participation worldwide and the increasing focus on mental health in this domain, translation and dissemination of the program may be warranted after replication.

TI  - A Game-Based School Program for Mental Health Literacy and Stigma on Depression (Moving Stories): Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - JMIR MENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Depressive symptoms are highly prevalent among adolescents in Western countries. However, although treatment for depressive symptoms is available, many adolescents do not seek help when they need it. Important barriers to help-seeking among adolescents include low mental health literacy and high stigma. Therefore, we have developed a game-based school program, Moving Stories, which combines mental health literacy training for depression with contact with someone with lived experience both in the digital and nondigital world.Objective: The aim of this study is to conduct a first test of the effectiveness of the newly developed game-based program, Moving Stories, using a cluster randomized controlled trial.Methods: A total of 185 adolescents participated, divided over 10 classes from 4 schools. Half of the classes were randomly selected to follow the Moving Stories program, whereas the other half were in the control group, where no intervention was provided. The adolescents filled out digital questionnaires at 4 time points, with questions on mental health literacy, stigma, depressive symptoms, and the program itself (before the program, after the program, 3-month follow-up, and 6-month follow-up). Using R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing), we ran linear mixed-effects models for all continuous outcome variables and generalized linear mixed-effects models for all binary outcome variables.Results: Compared with the control group, participants in the Moving Stories group improved after the program in personal stigma (b=-0.53, 95% CI -1.02 to -0.03; t(179.16)=-2.08; P=.04). Effects on personal stigma lasted over time (3-month follow-up: b=-0.57, 95% CI -1.11 to -0.03; t(174.39)=-2.07; P=.04). Most adolescents in the Moving Stories group participated in the introduction (97/99, 98%) and contact session (93/99, 94%), played the game for 4 or 5 days (83/99, 83%), and indicated that they would recommend the game to their peers (90/98, 92%).Conclusions: The results of this study show the potential of Moving Stories as a stigma reduction program. With changes in the program to improve its effects on mental health literacy, Moving Stories could be implemented in schools to improve help-seeking in adolescents and reduce the negative consequences and burden of depressive symptoms.

TI  - Education professionals' perceptions on perinatal mental health education in Australian and New Zealand medical and pharmacy curricula
T2  - CURRENTS IN PHARMACY TEACHING AND LEARNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Primary healthcare workers, including doctors and pharmacists, are well -positioned to detect and support women experiencing mental health disorders in the perinatal period. However, research exploring their education and training to fulfil these roles is limited. This study aimed to examine the perspectives of medical and pharmacy educational program representatives on perinatal mental health education in medical and pharmacy curricula at Australian and New Zealand universities. Methods: A web -based search (e.g., Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency) was used to identify potentially relevant medical and pharmacy educational program representatives. Eligible participants were invited to participate in audio -recorded semi -structured interviews which were transcribed verbatim. Data regarding perinatal mental health content within each program were extracted and tabulated for comparisons. Thematic analysis of participants' perspectives on perinatal mental health education was conducted. Results: Fifty medical and pharmacy educational program representatives were invited to participate (December 2022 -March 2023), of which 13 participated representing 14 programs. The extent and content of perinatal mental health education varied considerably across programs. Thematic analysis resulted in four themes: How much perinatal mental health content is enough?; Reflections on perinatal mental health related content; Perinatal mental health education in and beyond the classroom; Challenges associated with delivering perinatal mental health content. Conclusions: Participants acknowledged the importance of perinatal mental health content for medical and pharmacy students; however, limited time and lack of opportunities for students to complete placements were key challenges to curricular integration.

TI  - Youth Mental Health First Aid Training With Diverse Educators
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES
M3  - Article
AB  - Schools are the most likely place for students to receive formal or informal mental health services and support. Classroom educators often provide informal mental health support to students and referrals to school-based services. Despite their key role, educators often feel underprepared in recognizing concerning symptoms in youth and supporting student mental health. This mixed-methods study explored the effectiveness of in-person Youth Mental Health First Aid (YMHFA) training on a diverse sample of 106 educators (M-age = 22, SD = 1.9 years, 96% ethnic minorities): City Year AmeriCorps members who work in diverse low-income schools in Florida. We culturally adapted the program to better meet the needs of the participants and the students they serve as over 95% of the students they served were people of color. Quantitative survey data were collected at three time points (pre, post, and 3 months after the training) to examine whether YMHFA training better equipped classroom educators to support students ' mental health. Overall, training was associated with improvements in mental health literacy, knowledge of school-based mental health providers, confidence, and intentions to engage in mental health first aid (MHFA) behaviors. Notably, educators reported greater engagement in mental health first aid behaviors at the 3-month followup than before training. No improvement in mental health stigma was observed. Some improvements (i.e., mental health literacy, intentions to help) were not sustained at the follow-up. Qualitative data generally supported quantitative findings and suggested that the YMHFA program with cultural consideration is suitable for this diverse sample of classroom educators. Educators ' suggestions to improve the training to support culturally and linguistically diverse students ' mental health are discussed.Impact Statement A sample of diverse classroom educators ' mental health literacy, confidence, and intentions to engage in mental health first aid behaviors increased after attending in-person YMHFA training. Educators also reported greater use of mental health first aid behaviors at 3-month follow-up. Educators perceived the YMHFA training to be helpful while suggesting additional cultural adaptations.

TI  - Review: School-based interventions to improve mental health literacy and reduce mental health stigma - a systematic review
T2  - CHILD AND ADOLESCENT MENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Background The steadily increasing prevalence of mental disorders in children and adolescents presents itself as a public health challenge, especially given the health, social and economic burden of mental disorders. School-based interventions aimed at improving mental health literacy and reducing mental health stigma have the potential to prevent mental disorders and promote mental well-being, thus reducing the burden of mental disorders. This review identified and synthesised evidence on the effectiveness of school-based interventions designed to improve mental health literacy and reduce mental health stigma. Methods Electronic bibliographic databases including MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), Child Development and Adolescent Studies, British Education Index and Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA) were searched. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included if they assessed the effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of school-based intervention aimed at improving mental health literacy and reducing mental health stigma for children and young people aged 4-18 years. Quality of studies was appraised using the EPHPP tool. A numerical summary and a narrative description of the findings in relation to the research questions were synthesised. This systematic review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020191265). Results We identified 21 studies describing 20 unique school-based mental health interventions. Overall, there is moderate evidence suggesting that school-based mental health interventions can be effective in improving mental health literacy and reducing mental health stigma defined as attitudes and beliefs regarding mental disorders. However, there is less evidence for their long-term effectiveness, as most studies did not include follow-ups. Conclusions Despite exclusively including studies with randomised designs, intervention and methodological heterogeneity poses uncertainties to any conclusions made. Future research should focus on resolving methodological issues concerning how outcomes are assessed and include process evaluations to better inform the design of an intervention in term of its delivery and implementation.

TI  - A systematic mapping review of interventions to improve adolescent mental health literacy, attitudes and behaviours
T2  - EARLY INTERVENTION IN PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Review
AB  - Aim: The onset of mental illness is most common in adolescence, therefore mental health promotion efforts frequently target this age group. Evaluation literature in this area is largely segmented into specific domains in terms of settings, countries, and/or groups of young people, but an overall understanding and comparison across these areas is lacking. The current review aims to provide such an overview of interventions/programs which attempt to improve adolescents' mental health literacy, attitudes/stigma and behaviours.Methods: A systematic mapping review synthesized the strengths and weaknesses of published interventions/programs to improve mental health outcomes in youth. Ten databases and grey literature sources were searched, and results were categorized according to sample, location/setting, type of information presented, delivery and testing procedures, mental health outcome/s evaluated, and limitations.Results: One hundred and forty articles met the inclusion criteria; 126 were original records and 14 were reviews. Mental health literacy and attitudes/stigma were examined most frequently, and studies were predominantly conducted in school-based environments and high income economies. Intervention/program effectiveness varied across outcome/s measured, setting, and control group usage, with mental health literacy exhibiting the most positive changes overall. Common limitations included no long-term follow up or control group inclusion.Conclusions: Despite generally positive changes seen throughout studies in this area, effectiveness differed across a range of methodological domains. Most research is conducted in schools and higher income economies, but the lack of investigation in other contexts (i.e., internet or community) or lower income countries suggests our understanding in this area is constrained.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH TRAINING EDUCATION AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - PurposeThis paper aims to evaluate the cultural appropriateness, readability and suitability of the school-based mental health curriculum, with the ultimate aim of promoting students' mental health literacy.Design/methodology/approachThis research was conducted in two stages. The first stage involved a panel of experts evaluating the cultural appropriateness and adaptation of the mental health curriculum to Iranian culture. The second stage involved randomly selecting the first secondary schools in Sirjan and assessing the curriculum's readability and suitability. Five mental health counselors and 25 students were included in the study.FindingsThe results revealed that the cultural appropriateness and acceptability of the curriculum were verified following the implementation of cultural adjustments and reforms. The mean readability score for the mental health curriculum, measured by the readability of materials, was 13 before incorporating cultural appropriateness. After the inclusion of cultural appropriateness, the score improved to 16.5. Also, incorporating cultural appropriateness into the mental health curriculum increased the mean suitability of materials score from 62.7 to 87.2.Research limitations/implicationsFollowing the cultural appropriateness, the mental health curriculum was considered a superior medium due to its high score in cultural appropriateness, suitability and readability of materials.Practical implicationsEducational materials are recommended to be evaluated for appropriateness and readability before publication, and educational content should be tailored to the intended audience.Social implicationsUtilizing this program in schools can serve as a beneficial and efficient method to enhance students' mental health literacy.Originality/valueEducation professionals should ensure that instructional materials are appropriate for the intended audience.

TI  - Bridging the gap in mental health literacy: co-adapting and feasibility testing a digital intervention to improve mental health literacy amongst young people aged 12-14 in the UK
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Digital interventions have shown promise in enhancing mental health literacy among young people (YP). Initially developed in Indonesia, the Improving Mental Health Literacy Among Young People in Indonesia (IMPeTUs) intervention is a co-produced digital application designed to improve mental health literacy and self-management of anxiety and depression in YP. This study aimed to co-adapt the IMPeTUs intervention with YP in the UK and evaluate the feasibility of conducting a future definitive trial in education and community settings.Methods The study consisted of two phases. Phase 1 involved co-adapting the intervention through consultations with 49 stakeholders, including YP, parents, and professionals, using principles of experience-based co-design. 'Co-adapting' and 'co-creating' refer to collaborative modification and development of intervention content with stakeholders. Then, Phase 2 was a multi-site, cluster-randomized feasibility trial with a nested mixed-methods process evaluation conducted at two community sites (N = 19, 12 completing 4-week post-intervention data and 11 completing 3-month follow-up). The 'nested process evaluation' assessed acceptability and engagement alongside the trial.Results In Phase 1, the digital intervention was co-adapted with stakeholders to include expanded customization options, UK-specific content, and a new chapter on resilience, healthy relationships and self-care to improve engagement and support mental health literacy. Phase 2 showed the application was well-received, with YP appreciating its relatable storylines and problem-solving focus. Recruitment challenges and lengthy questionnaires highlighted the need for improved partnerships with schools and streamlined data collection. Despite these issues, the usability of the core design was validated, and recommendations to enhance engagement, such as reducing text and adding interactive features, were identified. Exploratory analyses suggested potential improvements in mental health literacy and well-being, although these results require confirmation in a well-powered trial.Conclusion This study highlights the feasibility of co-adapting and implementing digital interventions to improve mental health literacy among YP within community settings. Future work should focus on refining recruitment strategies for school environments, streamlining data collection, and enhancing engagement features to ensure scalability and effectiveness in large-scale evaluations. These findings lay the foundation for further development and rigorous digital mental health literacy intervention assessment.Clinical trial registration https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN16116467, identifier ISRCTN16116467.

TI  - Fostering Mental Health Literacy Among Primary School Professionals: Evaluating the Impact of an Online Training Program 'Well@School'.
T2  - International journal of environmental research and public health
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Mental health challenges among children and adolescents have become a pressing global concern, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing geopolitical instability. Addressing these issues requires innovative, cost-effective strategies, with schools serving as critical platforms for mental health promotion. This study evaluates the impact of an online training program, Well@School, designed to enhance Mental Health Literacy (MHL) among primary school professionals in Finland, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Slovenia, and Greece. Using a descriptive, cross-sectional design with pre- and post-test assessments, the study involved 223 health, education, and social care professionals. The revised Mental Health Literacy Scale (MHLS) was employed to measure changes in MHL. Results indicated a significant positive effect, with an average increase of 4 points (2.5%) in MHLS scores post-course. Bayesian analysis further confirmed this improvement, showing a high probability (99.92%) of a positive impact, with the most likely gain ranging between 3 and 5 points. The findings underscore the potential of online training programs to enhance MHL among school professionals, thereby improving their capacity to support students' mental health. This study highlights the importance of equipping primary school staff with the necessary skills to recognize and address mental health challenges, reduce stigma, and foster a supportive school environment.

TI  - Multi-Level Adaptations to Promote Implementation of School Mental Health Literacy Programs: A Synthesis and Case Study
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSchool mental health literacy programs, delivered at the universal level, are key to promoting positive behavioral health for all youth. Successfully implementing these programs requires adaptation to ensure the programs are aligned with contextual demands of the schools in which they are implemented. Yet, little is known about how to adapt and implement mental health literacy programs in school settings.PurposeThis article describes the process of adapting and implementing an educator-delivered school mental health literacy program in the context of a large comparative effectiveness trial. Adaptations are organized around ecological systems theory to provide a comprehensive account of the changes that were made.MethodExamples from 11 middle schools illustrate multilevel adaptations that fostered implementation.ResultsA case study details specific adaptations made at one school to improve implementation over 3 years. Dosage data portray increasing trends in implementation over time.DiscussionFindings are contextualized alongside the adaptations that were made, highlighting the importance of offering flexibility in delivery, identifying champions, and making iterative adaptations over time in response to local and societal changes.Translation to Health Education PracticeThe article concludes with considerations to researchers and practitioners, including Health Educators, interested in implementing school mental health literacy programs.

TI  - An online intervention to promote mental health literacy for psychosis amongst parents of adolescents: A pilot randomized controlled trial
T2  - EARLY INTERVENTION IN PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - AimThis study evaluated an online mental health literacy intervention to improve help-seeking for psychosis amongst parents of adolescents. MethodsA total of 2496 parents of first-grade junior high school students, recruited from a Japan-based survey company, participated in a randomized controlled trial in July 2016; participants were randomly allocated to the intervention (n = 1248) or control group (n = 1248). They were assessed at baseline and one-week post intervention. The intervention group received a 30-minute online educational programme that included a narrative of the mother of an adolescent with psychosis. ResultsThere were no between-group differences in changes in the rate of 'no help-seeking' in any hypothetical situations of a child's psychosis and prodromal symptoms. ConclusionsThe intervention might have been suboptimal to improve mental health literacy for psychosis amongst parents of adolescents. A narrative message from a service user may be helpful to encourage parents in help-seeking.

TI  - Becoming peer educators in workplace mental health: Qualitative exploration of challenges and opportunities
T2  - WORK-A JOURNAL OF PREVENTION ASSESSMENT & REHABILITATION
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Peer-led workplace mental health training programs informed by the principles of contact-based education have shown promising results, but research evidence largely focuses on measuring outcomes for service recipients with little attention to the experiences of peer educators in delivering these interventions.OBJECTIVE: To gain in-depth knowledge about the opportunities and challenges experienced peer educators recruited to lead a mental health literacy training program for healthcare workers.METHODS: An interpretive description approach was used to explore the experiences of peer educators in providing a structured two-day "Beyond Silence" workplace mental health training program. Peer educators were healthcare workers with personal mental health experience, who completed an additional leadership training. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with seven peer educators. Data collection and analysis was concurrent and iterative, employing inductive analysis.RESULTS: Four overarching themes captured the key opportunities and challenges faced by peer educators: 1) the art and science of providing mental health literacy training, 2) power of personal stories, 3) competence as a journey or a destination and 4) the dual role of educator and advocate.CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations are provided for recruitment, training, and support for peer educators. Future research could focus on longitudinal evaluation of engagement and sustainability of peer educators in this role.

AB  - BackgroundMental health literacy is a promising avenue of intervention for addressing the development of psychopathology, as well as its associated consequences, such as a decrease in academic performance. The current study aims to test the effectiveness of such an intervention in high school students, focusing on two main formats of delivery: (1) automated and (2) blended.MethodsTo achieve this aim, a randomized clinical trial with direct comparisons at three time points between three conditions (automated, blended, and waitlist) was designed. Power analyses yielded a necessary sample size of 264 high school students. The participants will be selected from Romanian high schools.DiscussionThe current study aims to contribute to the mental health literacy literature by testing the effectiveness of an educational intervention concerning mental health in terms of its benefits for reducing psychopathology and increasing academic performance. The success of such an intervention bears important implications for addressing mental health in the educational system.Trial registrationClinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT06217744, version 1, 22 January 2024.

TI  - Child Mental Health Literacy Among Vietnamese and Cambodian Mothers
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Parents' perceptions of their children's mental health-including recognition of specific mental health problems as such, and their beliefs about the causes and treatments for the problems-have an important impact on child mental health. This study investigated child mental health literacy among Cambodian and Vietnamese mothers. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 357 mothers in Hanoi, Vietnam, and Pnom Penh and Kampong Speu, Cambodia. The Child Mental Health Literacy Questionnaire was used to assess mothers' mental health literacy, in particular, their ability to correctly identify different mental health disorders, and their understanding of causes of the mental health problems, and about the utility of different treatments. The overall level of mental health literacy among mothers in these two countries was low, with the proportions of mothers able to correctly identify different mental health problems ranging from 0.17 (Oppositional Defiant Disorder) to 0.35 (Trauma-related). Biological causes and adverse experiences were the most frequently selected causes of generic mental health problems. Medication, parent training and family counseling were the three most positively rated forms of treatment for mental health problems in general. Although Vietnam and Cambodia are geographic neighbors, varying results across these countries appear to reflect their different historical backgrounds. For instance, the largest difference between the two countries was for trauma-related problems, which may be related to the Cambodian history of genocide. Findings such as this demonstrate the need for contextually developed and focused public health intervention for mothers of children to improve their mental health literacy.

TI  - The Youth Aware of Mental Health Intervention: Impact on Help Seeking, Mental Health Knowledge, and Stigma in US Adolescents
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Suicide is a leading cause of death among U.S. youth aged 12-18 years. Youth Aware of Mental Health (YAM), a promising, universal, school-based mental health promotion/suicide primary prevention intervention for adolescents, has been evaluated in Europe but not in the U.S. The present study used an uncontrolled, pretest/post-test design to document the potential for YAM to reduce suicidal ideation, attempt, and suicide. A demonstration that help seeking behaviors, mental health literacy, and mental health stigmatizing attitudes improve after the intervention would suggest that the program is promising in the U.S., as well as in Europe, and that further investigation is merited.Methods: YAM was delivered to 1,878 students in 11 schools as part of regular school curricula. A subset of these students (n = 436) completed surveys before and 3 months postdelivery. Surveys included five questions about help seeking behaviors, a measure of intent to seek help (General Help Seeking Questionnaire), two mental health literacy scales, and two mental illness stigma scales (Reported and Intended Behavior Scale and Personal Stigma and Social Distance Scale). Both McNemar's test and repeated measures linear models were used to determine whether the survey outcomes changed after YAM delivery.Results: Among the 436 adolescents (286 and 150 in Montana and Texas, respectively), significant increases were found pre- to post-intervention in three of five help seeking behaviors, along with improved mental health literacy and decreased mental health-related stigma. Intent to seek help was unchanged.Conclusions: Several help seeking behavioral factors, mental health knowledge, and stigma improved post-YAM intervention. All three domains are likely protective against suicide. A randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of YAM in preventing suicidal behaviors is warranted.

TI  - The Long-Term Effectiveness of Interventions Addressing Mental Health Literacy and Stigma of Mental Illness in Children and Adolescents: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Objectives: This study aims to provide a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature on the long-term effects of interventions addressing children's and adolescents' mental health literacy and/or stigmatizing attitudes.Methods: Articles in English or German published between January 1997 and May 2020 were retrieved from five databases, leading to a total of 4,375 original articles identified.Results: 25 studies were included after applying exclusion criteria, 13 of which were eligible for meta-analysis. The overall average of the follow-up period was about 5 months. Long-term improvements were sustained for mental health literacy, d = 0.48, 95% CI = (0.34, 0.62), as well as for stigmatizing attitudes, d = 0.30, 95% CI = (0.24, 0.36), and social distance, d = 0.16, 95% CI = (0.03, 0.29). The combination of educational and contact components within interventions led to worse results for mental health literacy, but not stigmatizing attitudes or social distance.Conclusion: Interventions targeting children and adolescents generally have a brief follow-up period of an average of 5 months. They show a stable improvement in mental health literacy, but are to a lesser degree able to destigmatize mental illness or improve social distance.

TI  - Cultural adaptation of youth mental health first aid training for Asian American parents
T2  - JOURNAL OF SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although often portrayed as "model minorities," many Asian American adolescents struggle with mental health problems. Asian American youth are also less likely to receive school-based mental health services (SBMHS) compared with their non-Asian peers. Culturally adapting the Youth Mental Health Fist Aid (YMHFA) training program can be an effective way to engage Asian American parents to utilize SBMHS. Although many school districts have offered YMHFA trainings to staff and parents, no controlled studies have evaluated the efficacy of YMHFA in the United States. We culturally adapted YMHFA for Asian American parents through collaboration with schools and community organizations, and evaluated its efficacy using a blocked random assignment study design. We examined if (a) YMHFA impacted parents' mental health literacy (MHL), help-seeking intentions, stigma, attitudes towards professional help, confidence in MHFA skills, engagement in first-aid behaviors, and youth mental health (both parent and youth report); and (b) whether the improvement was maintained four months after the training. Parents (n = 99, Mage = 46.24; SDage = 6.80, 89 % mothers) were randomly assigned to treatment and waitlist control groups. They completed measures before the intervention, one month after the intervention, and four months after the intervention. Parents in the experimental group showed decreased stigma, and improvements in MHL, attitudes towards help seeking, confidence in using first aid behavior, and actual engagement in first aid behavior after attending the training as compared to parents in the waitlist control group. Participants in waitlist control group also showed improvements in all above-mentioned areas after receiving the training. All treatment gains were maintained at 4-month follow-up. Findings contributed to the limited literature on how to culturally adapt YMHFA for Asian American parents at school, and provided evidence for the efficacy of YMHFA among Asian American parents.

TI  - Promotion of social and emotional learning in a Chinese elementary school
T2  - SOCIAL BEHAVIOR AND PERSONALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although there is substantial evidence for the merits of integrating social and emotional learning (SEL) into educational settings, little empirical research on this learning approach has been conducted in Mainland China. We synthesized the frameworks of Western SEL and the guidelines of Chinese mental health education, and conducted a preliminary assessment of a short-term SEL curriculum that we designed and piloted in an elementary school. We randomly assigned two classes comprising 111 fifth-grade students to take the SEL curriculum (intervention group), and compared them with a third class comprising 53 fifth-grade students assigned the usual curriculum (control group). The results show that the intervention group had a significant increase in emotional intelligence scores after completing the activities in the curriculum, and the control group experienced an increase in feelings of competitiveness. Students in the intervention group generally perceived the SEL curriculum as striking the right balance between enjoyable activities and valuable learning. Our findings imply that it would be a positive educational development to design SEL curricula for systematic use across multiple grades, thus weaving these into the formal Chinese elementary school system.

T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data set
AB  - Adolescents are vulnerable to mental health problems, and this vulnerability may be enhanced in situations such as the present COVID-19 pandemic. Online mental health literacy (MHL) education may help adolescents maintain/improve their mental health, especially in situations where face-to-face education is difficult. To evaluate the effects of a teacher-led ���online Short MHL Program (o-SMHLP)��� delivered online to grade 10 students in their classrooms. Students (age 15���16) were randomly assigned to an o-SMHLP group (n���=���115 (3 classes)) or a control group (n���=���155 (4 classes)) at the class level. The program consisted of a 20-minute session which included an animated video.

TI  - Promoting early-intervention for suicide prevention: The role of mental health literacy and attitudes towards suicide: A quantitative study in Ireland.
T2  - HEALTH POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Suicide is a global public health issue which has far-reaching impacts on individuals, families, and wider communities. Early intervention is a core pillar of policy on the prevention of suicide related deaths. However, limited mental health literacy, and negative attitudes regarding mental illness amongst the public are a barrier to early intervention. Past research has not explored mental health literacy and attitudes regarding suicide specifically. The aim of the current study was to examine mental health literacy and attitudes towards suicide in adults. 590 adults in Ireland aged 18-80 years (M = 43.24, SD = 12.6) took part in this online cross-sectional study, completing the Mental Health Literacy Scale and The Attitudes Towards Suicide Scale. Experience of suicide deaths was common among participants. Independent t-tests indicated that males had significantly lower levels of mental health literacy and more stigmatising attitudes towards suicide than females. Young adults also had lower ability to recognise mental health difficulties than older adults. Hierarchical Multiple Regressions found that mental health literacy significantly accounted for varied attitudes towards suicide in adults, particularly willingness to communicate about suicide, and beliefs that suicide is preventable. Findings are discussed in the context of informing policy-makers who are promoting early-intervention for suicide prevention.

AB  - Adolescents are vulnerable to mental health problems, and this vulnerability may be enhanced in situations such as the present COVID-19 pandemic. Online mental health literacy (MHL) education may help adolescents maintain/improve their mental health, especially in situations where face-to-face education is difficult. To evaluate the effects of a teacher-led ���online Short MHL Program (o-SMHLP)��� delivered online to grade 10 students in their classrooms. Students (age 15���16) were randomly assigned to an o-SMHLP group (n���=���115 (3 classes)) or a control group (n���=���155 (4 classes)) at the class level. The program consisted of a 20-minute session which included an animated video. The students completed a self-report questionnaire pre- and post-intervention assessing outcomes including: ���Knowledge about mental health/illnesses���, ���Recognition of necessity to seek help���, ���Intention to seek help���, and ���Unwillingness to socialize with people having mental illness���. Mixed effects modeling was employed for analyses. All outcomes were significantly improved in the intervention group compared to the control group post-intervention, except for ���intention to seek help���. The present study shows the effectiveness of an online MHL intervention while identifying the need for the development of effective online programs targeting adolescents��� ���intention to seek help���.

TI  - Evaluating the effect of an adapted mental health literacy intervention on mental health related stigma among secondary students in Germany: results of a pre-post evaluation study
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundMost mental health problems develop during youth, with about three quarter emerging before age 25. In adolescence, stigmatizing attitudes related to mental illness become more nuanced and consolidate into one's belief system. As the stigma of mental illness is still one of the leading barriers to help-seeking, intervention measures should explicitly address it before it becomes entrenched over time. Preventive measures, for example, based on promoting mental health literacy (MHL), can be used to address and tackle stigmatizing attitudes. The Canadian MHL-based intervention "the Guide" was translated and adapted for the use in German schools. The present study evaluates the effect of the German version of the Guide on attitudes towards mental illness among students in Germany.MethodsThe first-time application of the Guide (German version) was evaluated with a pre-post-evaluation study with an intervention and a control group. The evaluation data of 188 students (intervention group n = 106, control group n = 82) were statistically analyzed focusing on the outcomes social stigma, social distance, and self-stigma.ResultsThe analysis showed that participants do not tend to hold stigmatizing attitudes even before the intervention. Nevertheless, the intervention was effective in reducing social stigma, but not in reducing social distance and self-stigma. Neither gender, pre-existing experience with mental illness, nor the delivery modality of the contact element within the intervention (speaker vs. video) seemed to influence the outcomes.ConclusionsThe German version of the MHL-based intervention, the Guide, seems to be a suitable intervention to improve attitudes towards mental illness among students in Germany. More extensive research is necessary to confirm the findings and further explore factors that influence the program's effects on attitudes short- and long-term.

TI  - Evaluating a prototype digital mental health literacy intervention for children and young people aged 11-15 in Java, Indonesia: a mixed methods, multi-site case study evaluation
T2  - CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY AND MENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe Improving Mental Health Literacy Among Children and Young People in Indonesia (IMPeTUs) intervention is a co-produced, evidence-based digital intervention designed to improve anxiety and depression focused mental health literacy and self-management among people aged 11-15 in Java, Indonesia. This study aimed to evaluate the usability, feasibility and preliminary impact of our intervention.MethodsMixed methods, multi-site case studies based on a theory of change. Pre-and post-assessments of a range of outcomes and qualitative interviews/focus groups with children and young people (CYP), parents and facilitators. The intervention was implemented in 8 health, school and community sites across Java, Indonesia (Megelang, Jakarta and Bogor).Quantitative data designed to understand the impact of and feasibility of evaluating the intervention collected from 78 CYP who used the intervention were analysed descriptively. Qualitative data from interviews and focus groups collected from 56 CYP, 49 parents/caregivers and 18 facilitators were analysed using framework analysis.ResultsQualitative data analysis indicated high levels of usability and acceptability for the interface aesthetic, personalisation, message presentation and navigation. Participants reported minimal burden and no negative outcomes associated with the intervention. CYP, parents and facilitators identified a range of direct and spill over effects of interventions engagement, some of which were not anticipated at study outset. Quantitative data highlighted the feasibility of intervention evaluation, with high levels of recruitment and retention across study time points. Minimal changes were identified in outcomes pre-to-post intervention, which may in part be due to a lack of scale relevance and/or sensitivity to the intervention mechanisms indicated in the qualitative data.ConclusionsDigital mental health literacy applications are potentially an acceptable and feasible way to prevent burdens of common mental health problems amongst CYP in Indonesia. Our intervention and evaluative processes will be further refined prior to definitive evaluation.

AB  - Mental health has a significant impact on both individuals and society, but our society still lacks a proper understanding of it. This is especially important during adolescence, as mental health problems often begin to manifest during this period. Early intervention can greatly influence later life outcomes, but such intervention is often delayed for various reasons. Therefore, This study surveyed the relationship between mental health literacy and help-seeking attitudes among 300 adolescents from four middle schools in region D, Gyeonggi Province, and examined whether the attitudes of parents and friends have a moderating effect. The results showed that adolescents' mental health literacy positively influences help-seeking attitudes, and that parents'attitudes had a moderating effect on the relationship between the two variables. However, the moderating effect of friends' attitudes was not statistically significant. These findings suggest that the level of adolescents' mental health literacy is influenced by their parents, and that this can lead to changes in help-seeking attitudes. Therefore, the conclusion presents directions and practical measures for mental health literacy education to enhance adolescents' mental health.

TI  - A Systematic Review of Parents' Mental Health Literacy Programs: Examining Program Effectiveness and Parent Satisfaction
T2  - CHILD PSYCHIATRY & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Current estimates suggest that nearly one in five youth in the United States have a clinically significant mental health problem. Many of these youth do not receive services, and if they do, they are often not evidence-based treatments. Parents are critical to the utilization of psychological services for youth; they are typically considered the gatekeepers to mental health services and frequently initiate help-seeking on behalf of their youth. Research has demonstrated that parents do not have sufficient knowledge and skills needed to handle youth mental health problems (i.e., mental health literacy), which likely contributes to the youth treatment disparity. To address this, the current systematic review explored global mental health literacy programs for parents to examine program effectiveness and parent satisfaction with programs. Nine programs were identified and described in terms of structure, content, and delivery method. Several programs demonstrated improvement in at least one component of parents' mental health literacy. Additionally, when assessed, parent satisfaction was generally positive, though areas for improvement were noted (e.g., program content lacked specificity, need for more practical parenting skills). Overall, findings have meaningful implications for future research and program development.

TI  - Effect of a mental health education intervention on children's life satisfaction and self-confidence in rural China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Children living in rural areas may potentially experience low levels of life satisfaction and face challenges in developing self-confidence. The purpose of the current study was to examine the impact of a mental health education intervention on the life satisfaction and self-confidence of children residing in rural areas of China. A total of 1,001 children from grades 4 to 6 were randomly assigned to an intervention group (475 children, 250 boys, M = 11.57 years, SD = 1.082 years) and a control group (526 children, 279 boys, M = 11.38 years, SD = 0.980 years). Over 16 weeks, the intervention group received a mental health education program, while the control group did not. The levels of life satisfaction (including five dimensions: family, school, environmental, friends, and self-satisfaction) and self-confidence (including three dimensions: self-efficacy, self-assurance, and self-competence) were rated by all children at baseline and post-intervention. Results from paired samples t-test showed that post-intervention, the intervention group exhibited significant improvements in the areas of family, environmental, school, and self-satisfaction as well as self-efficacy, self-assurance, and self-competence. However, there was no significant improvement in friend satisfaction. Conversely, the control group showed decreases in school, environmental, and friend satisfaction, along with decreases in self-efficacy, self-assurance, and self-competence. No significant change was observed in family and self-satisfaction in this group. These findings emphasize the importance of implementing mental health education interventions for rural children, who are at risk for low life satisfaction and self-confidence. Some specific recommendations are provided for policymakers and practitioners.

TI  - Incorporating Mental Health Literacy Into the Sport Management Curriculum
T2  - SPORT MANAGEMENT EDUCATION JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Mental health is an emerging area of interest in sport, but there is a paucity of educational initiatives in sport management curricula to train the next generation of sport managers to address the mental health needs of athletes, a type of knowledge that the mental health literature operationalizes as mental health literacy. One goal of accrediting bodies such as the Commission on Sport Management Accreditation is for excellence in sport management education; thus, due to the changing landscape of sport, sport management curricula should incorporate mental health literacy competencies. This educational research review provides justification for the inclusion of mental health literacy competencies in sport management curricula and accreditation standards, as well as pedagogical strategies for implementation.

T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background We aimed to improve mental health referral quality of young people by helping educators build capacity for early identification of youth at risk of mental illness and facilitate referrals between the education and health systems.Methods We applied the Go-To Educator mental health literacy training for early identification, triage and support in 208 schools in Calgary, Alberta between 2013 and 2016. Students presenting to mental health services during this time were compared on a number of clinical, system, and demographic variables, based on the training status of the school (untrained schools; before and after training schools), using retrospective cohort design. Based on clinical and system data, bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis were employed to compare the three school status domains.Results After training, referrals differed significantly from control and pre-training schools. Students presenting to services from these schools were younger, from single parent families; were referred more because of adjustment and learning/attention problems; had complex social/family issues; thought disturbances, and harmful behavior/thoughts towards others. While they waited longer to be admitted they stayed longer in services; had more provisional comorbid diagnoses and demonstrated positive treatment outcomes.Conclusions The Go-To Educator training may be an effective intervention helping educators identify students at risk of mental disorders and in substantial need of mental health services, demonstrating improved linkages between education and health sectors.

TI  - Culturally Adapting Youth Mental Health First Aid Training for Asian Americans
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite high rates of mental health challenges, Asian Americans are less likely to seek out and receive school-based mental health services (SBMHSs) than their non-Asian peers. The Youth Mental Health First Aid (YMHFA) training is an 8-hr manualized public education program designed to educate adults on recognizing common mental health challenges among adolescents and intervening. However, no published research has evaluated YMHFA among Asian Americans. We culturally adapted YMHFA for Asian Americans (Asian American parents and youth workers) and used a pretest/posttest design to evaluate its effectiveness. Specifically, we (a) added one 2-hr session before the YMHFA to augment engagement with the curriculum and (b) contextualized the YMHFA curriculum content to ensure cultural sensitivity for Asian American participants. Thirty-one Asian immigrant parents (M (age) = 45.55, SD = 3.6) and 24 Asian American youth workers (M (age) = 23.17, SD = 3.67) participated in YMHFA. Participants' mental health literacy (MHL) and their confidence in using MHFA skills significantly increased after the training. Participants also participated in four focus groups after the training to share their experiences. Participants stated that they benefited from this training and suggested additional cultural adaptations to make the program more appropriate for Asian Americans. Culturally adapted YMHFA may be an effective way to promote MHL and engage Asian Americans in mental health services.Impact Statement Asian American parents' and youth workers' MHL and confidence in using MHFA skills increased after attending YMHFA. Asian Americans perceived culturally adapted YMHFA training to be helpful. Culturally adapted YMHFA could help to engage Asian Americans in SBMHS.

AB  - Objectives: This study aims to provide a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature on the long-term effects of interventions addressing childrens and adolescents mental health literacy and/or stigmatizing attitudes.Methods: Articles in English or German published between January 1997 and May 2020 were retrieved from five databases, leading to a total of 4,375 original articles identified.Results: 25 studies were included after applying exclusion criteria, 13 of which were eligible for meta-analysis. The overall average of the follow-up period was about 5months. Long-term improvements were sustained for mental health literacy, d = 0.48, 95% CI = (0.34, 0.62), as well as for stigmatizing attitudes, d = 0.30, 95% CI = (0.24, 0.36), and social distance, d = 0.16, 95% CI = (0.03, 0.29). The combination of educational and contact components within interventions led to worse results for mental health literacy, but not stigmatizing attitudes or social distance.Conclusion: Interventions targeting children and adolescents generally have a brief follow-up period of an average of 5months. They show a stable improvement in mental health literacy, but are to a lesser degree able to destigmatize mental illness or improve social distance. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

TI  - Psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the Mental Health Literacy questionnaire (MHLq-E)
T2  - CURRENT PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The mental health of adolescents is a topic of increasing importance in our society. Knowing the mental health literacy of this population may provide key information to improve prevention and intervention policies. This research analyses the psychometric properties of the MHLq-E Spanish version, a self-administered self-report questionnaire on mental health literacy, specific to the adolescent population. A descriptive cross-sectional study including a representative sample of Spanish adolescents aged 12-16 years (N = 1000) was conducted. Results reveal a four-factor structure: help-seeking; stigma; knowledge of causes; knowledge of symptomatology. The selected four-factor solution accounts for 35% of the shared variance. High internal consistency, item reliability and good measures of validity were found. The global reliability of the questionnaire was alpha = 0.92 and omega t = 0.94. The reliability of the dimensions ranged from alpha = 0.79, omega t = 0.79 for Stigma to alpha = 0.87, omega t = 0.87 for Help. Factor loads were significant and above 0.4 suggesting appropriate convergent validity, and evidence of discriminant validity was also adequate. Although it differs from the original instrument, the analysis is consistent with other research and highlights the multiple dimensions of mental health literacy. The MHLq-E is the first instrument available in Spanish to assess mental health literacy in adolescents in Spain.

TI  - The Intervention Effect of Online Mindfulness Training in Alleviating Youths' Test Anxiety
T2  - YOUTH & SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - With rapid development and modernization of today's society, the resource inequality between rural and urban areas has enlarged, especially regarding adolescents' mental health education. In order to provide alternative to adolescents with limited resources, this study targets test anxiety as example, aiming to explore the effectiveness of online mindfulness training in alleviating students' test anxiety through a quasi-experiment. This study recruited youths from 12 to 18 years old and used their pre-test/post-test data on 186 trained participants (Mage = 14.85, 57.5% male) and 217 propensity-score matched controls (Mage = 15.35, 53% male). After careful analysis, the results proved the effectiveness of online mindfulness training in reducing test anxiety and showed that the online training was more beneficial for students with serious interpersonal problems. This study further provided implications for the use of technology in mental health education, promoting the care of psychological well-being in rural areas.

TI  - The Effects of Universal Educational Interventions in Improving Mental Health Literacy, Depression, and Anxiety Among Adolescents: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH NURSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Adolescents are susceptible to developing depression and anxiety, and educational interventions could improve their mental well-being. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of universal educational prevention interventions in improving mental health literacy, depression, and anxiety among adolescents. Eight electronic databases were searched until June 2024: Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest Dissertations, and Theses Global. Since the included studies assessed various aspects of mental health literacy, the results for mental health literacy were synthesized narratively. In contrast, a meta-analysis using a random-effects model was applied to the depression and anxiety outcomes. Heterogeneity was examined using I2 statistics and Cochran's Q Chi-squared test. The Cochrane risk of bias tool and the GRADE approach conducted quality appraisal at the study and outcome levels, respectively. The review was reported according to the PRISMA guidelines. This review included 34 randomized controlled trials. Universal education prevention interventions were found to be promising in improving adolescents' mental health literacy but showed limited effects on individual mental health literacy components and on reducing depression (SMD = -0.06, 95%CI: [-0.11, -0.02], Z = 2.58, p = 0.01, I2 = 45%) and anxiety (SMD = -0.00, 95%CI: [-0.06, 0.06], Z = 0.07, p = 0.94, I2 = 58%) at post-intervention. Future trials should consider using a hybrid delivery model utilizing health care and the non-health care professionals. These interventions must incorporate skills-based sessions to develop emotional regulation strategies, complemented by extended follow-up periods that include booster sessions to reinforce learning. Given the very low quality of evidence as rated by the GRADE approach, current findings need to be interpreted with caution.

M3  - Article
AB  - The ProLiSMental psychoeducational intervention intends to promote adolescents' mental health literacy on anxiety, facilitating their access, understanding, evaluation, and use of effective mental health information. This study aimed to assess the acceptability and feasibility of that intervention in a school context and improve its content, structure, and procedure. A convenience sample of seventeen participants has been recruited: eleven students (mean age = 14.09 years, SD = 0,30) and six education and health professionals (mean age = 53.00 years, SD = 4,05). High levels of acceptability and feasibility of the ProLiSMental psychoeducational intervention were observed and important improvements were made.

TI  - A Scoping Review and Analysis of Mental Health Literacy Interventions for Children and Youth
T2  - SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW
M3  - Review
AB  - Mental health literacy (MHL) encompasses understanding mental health and learning how to obtain and maintain good mental health. Increasing MHL may increase help-seeking behaviors and positive mental health. This study aimed to identify school-based MHL interventions for children/youth using a scoping review methodology following the Johanna Briggs Model. The interventions were assessed for quality of evidence using the National Institutes of Health Study Quality Assessment Tools. Six databases were searched: Scopus, APA PsycInfo, Cochrane Library, ERIC, PubMed, and ProQuest Psychology. Search terms included "mental health literacy," "intervention," and "children." The search yielded 27 studies after applying inclusion criteria. Eight of these studies were assessed as "poor" quality, twelve as "fair" quality, and seven as "good" quality. The results highlight the need for more research to implement and evaluate interventions to sustainably and feasibly incorporate school-based MHL interventions for children and youth into practice. Impact Statement Mental health literacy interventions are needed to improve knowledge of mental health, promote help-seeking for mental illness, and reduce stigma and negative attitudes toward mental illness. This review identifies that more good quality research is required of school-based mental health literacy interventions. New research is urgently needed to evaluate the feasibility and sustainability of interventions that reduce the prevalence of mental illness for children and youth.

TI  - Developing and evaluating a peer-based mental health literacy intervention with adolescent athletes
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Widespread adolescent involvement in organized sport means that sport contexts are well-suited to 'actively' integrate prevention programs that may promote population-level change. This mixed methods study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a peer-based mental health literacy intervention. The intervention (i.e., Team Talk) was presented to eleven adolescent sport teams in the United States, with a total of 174 participants. Athlete participants completed surveys immediately before and after the intervention-including measures of workshop acceptability, social identity, and help-seeking behaviors. Semi-structured interviews were also conducted with a subset of five athletes, nine parents, and two coaches. With respect to recruitment as an indicator of feasibility, club-level adoption of the intervention was low, with difficulty recruiting clubs for intervention delivery. This signals that feasibility of the intervention-as it is currently designed and implemented by the research team-is low when considering similar competitive adolescent sport clubs and delivered as team-level workshops. Meanwhile, participants reported high acceptability of the intervention, and acceptability levels across participants was predicted by contextual factors related to implementation such as session duration. Regarding limited efficacy testing with measures completed before and after the intervention session: (a) social identity scores increased following the intervention, and (b) significant differences were not identified regarding efficacy to recognize symptoms of mental disorders. Athlete, coach, and parent interview responses also described potential adaptations to mental health programs. This research demonstrates the potential utility of peer-based mental health literacy interventions, while also revealing that further implementation research is necessary to adapt mental health literacy interventions to suit diverse adolescent sport contexts.

TI  - The Design and Implementation of a Novel Mental Health Literacy Educational Intervention Program in Gaelic Footballers
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATHLETIC TRAINING
M3  - Article
AB  - Context: Lack of education, stigma, and negative self -attitudes are key barriers to help-seeking in Gaelic football-ers. With the prevalence of mental health issues in Gaelic footballers and the increased risk of experiencing mental health challenges after injury, mental health literacy (MHL) interventions are necessary. Objectives: To design and implement a novel MHL educa-tional intervention program in Gaelic footballers. Design: Controlled laboratory study. Setting: Online. Patients or Other Participants: Elite and subelite Gaelic footballers divided into intervention (n = 70; age = 25.1 +/- 4.5 years) and control (n = 75; age = 24.4 +/- 6.0 years) groups. In the intervention group, 85 participants were recruited, but 15 dropped out after completing baseline measures. Interventions: A novel educational intervention program, "GAA [Gaelic Athletic Association] and Mental Health-Injury and a Healthy Mind," was designed to address the key compo-nents of MHL and was underpinned by the Theory of Planned Behavior and the Help-Seeking Model. The intervention was implemented online via a brief 25-minute presentation. Main Outcome Measures: Measures of stigma, help-seeking attitudes, and MHL were completed by the intervention group at baseline, immediately after viewing the MHL program, and at 1 week and 1 month after the intervention. The control group completed the measures at similar time points. Results: Stigma decreased, and attitudes toward help -seeking and MHL increased in the intervention group from base-line to after the intervention (P , .05), with significant differences sustained at 1-week and 1-month follow-ups. Our results showed differences in stigma, attitudes, and MHL between groups across time points. Intervention participants provided positive feedback, and the program was appraised as informative. Conclusions: Remote online delivery of a novel MHL edu-cational program can effectively decrease mental health stigma, improve attitudes toward help-seeking, and increase the recogni-tion and knowledge of mental health issues. Gaelic footballers with improved MHL may be better equipped to manage their mental health and cope with stressors, leading to improved men-tal health outcomes and overall mental well-being.

AB  - The onset of many lifelong mental illnesses is during childhood and adolescence. There has been an increase in these conditions among children and adolescents especially, during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is essential to promote mental health literacy (MHL) as a preven-tive and universal intervention for children and adolescents. Positive mental health status in adolescence is related to an increased level of MHL, and various MHL programs at schools have been reported to be effective for adolescent students worldwide. Recently, MHL programs have been developed in South Korea to be used by schoolteachers. There is a need for active dissemination and development of future programs. For continuous and effective education, it is desirable to include MHL education in regular school curricula.

TI  - A process evaluation of a peer education project to improve mental health literacy in secondary school students: study protocol
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Emotional disorders in young people are increasing but studies have found that this age group do not always recognise the signs and symptoms of mental health problems in themselves or others. The Mental Health Foundation's school-based Peer Education Project (PEP) has the potential to improve young people's understanding of their own mental health at a critical developmental stage (early adolescence) using a peer teaching method. This study is a process evaluation to understand: the mechanisms through which PEP might improve young people's mental health literacy, any challenges with delivery, how the project can be embedded within wider school life and how it can be improved to be of most benefit to the widest number of young people. We will also validate a bespoke mental health literacy questionnaire, and test the feasibility of using it to measure outcomes in preparation for a future study evaluating effectiveness. Methods All schools recruited to the study will receive the PEP intervention. The process evaluation will be informed by realist evaluation approaches to build understanding regarding key mechanisms of change and the impact of different school contexts. The evaluation will test and revise an existing intervention logic model which has been developed in partnership with the Mental Health Foundation. Process evaluation data will be collected from newly recruited schools (n = 4) as well as current PEP user schools (n = 2) including training and lesson delivery observations, staff interviews and student focus groups. Baseline and follow-up data will be collected in all newly recruited intervention schools (n = 4) from all students in Year 7/8 (who receive the PEP) and recruited peer educators in Year 12 via a self-report survey. Discussion This study will enable us to refine the logic model underpinning the peer education project and identify areas of the intervention that can be improved. Findings will also inform the design of a future effectiveness study which will test out the extent to which PEP improves mental health literacy.

T2  - SAGE OPEN
M3  - Review
AB  - To address the urgent need for effective adolescent mental health support, this systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the impact of mental health literacy interventions on adolescents, a group highly susceptible to mental health issues. In accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and registered under the International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (INPLASY202330098), our research thoroughly searched prominent databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO, CNKI, Wanfang, and Chongqing VIP. We focused on studies employing a pre-test-post-test design to compare mental health literacy interventions against control groups. Our analysis included 18 studies revealing statistically significant improvements in adolescents' mental health literacy, knowledge, and help-seeking and a reduction in stigma associated with mental health issues. The effectiveness of these interventions varied significantly across regions, with notable improvements in Asia, particularly in terms of help-seeking and stigma reduction. Interventions featuring frequent interactions proved particularly effective, showing significant increases in mental health knowledge and help-seeking. Multifaceted interventions that combined various methods were most beneficial for enhancing mental health knowledge. Importantly, although the positive effects on mental health literacy and stigma reduction were sustained at the 2-month follow-up, the improvements in help-seeking did not maintain significant levels post-intervention. These findings emphasize the critical need for tailored mental health literacy programs for adolescents and provide novel insights into the efficacy of interactive and diverse intervention strategies.

TI  - Improving mental health literacy in year 9 high school children across Wales: a protocol for a randomised control treatment trial (RCT) of a mental health literacy programme across an entire country
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundAdolescence is a crucial period for developing and maintaining good habits for mental health and well-being. This is important for future mental health, as most mental health problems manifest during adolescence. Mental health literacy is the foundation for mental health prevention, stigma reduction, and increased help-seeking efficacy particularly among adolescents. The mental health literacy programme "The Guide", which was developed in Canada, has shown success in increasing mental health literacy in North American 16-17year olds. "The Guide Cymru" is an adaptation of The Guide designed for a younger age group (13-14year olds) and for the Welsh culture and context and is being offered to all state schools in Wales.MethodsThis two-armed cluster randomised control trial (RCT) will evaluate the effectiveness of The Guide Cymru. All 205 secondary schools in Wales will be invited to take part, involving up to 30,000year 9 pupils. Schools will be randomised to either the immediate implementation of The Guide Cymru or to a wait-list control. The wait-list control will receive The Guide Cymru around 12weeks later. Measures of mental health literacy (assessed via the Knowledge and Attitudes to Mental Health scale) and mental health problems (via the PedsQL and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire) will be taken at baseline (pre-intervention), 12weeks later (after the active group has received The Guide Cymru), and 24weeks later (after the wait-list control has received The Guide Cymru).DiscussionThe trial aims to evaluate if The Guide Cymru increases mental health literacy, including reduced stigma to others and to the self, and increased levels of good mental health behaviours and help-seeking for mental health problems.Trial registrationISRCTN15462041.

TI  - Preliminary Investigation of a Novel Cognitive Behavioural Therapy Curriculum on the Wellbeing of Middle Schoolers
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE CANADIAN ACADEMY OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: A number of school-based interventions for preventing and attenuating symptoms of anxiety and depression in youth have been developed worldwide but evidence of their effectiveness is mixed. None of these curricula stem from existing children's literature, however, the Harry Potter (HP) series has been identified as potentially imparting Cognitive Behavioural Therapy concepts. Methods: This study aimed to broadly capture, at an interim stage, the feasibility of a pilot HP curriculum aimed at imparting CBT skills to middle-schoolers in order to inform full development of the curriculum. The study design further included a non-randomized, Group (HP; Control) by Time (Baseline, Post-Intervention, Followup) mixed factorial approach retrospectively examining change in scores on a "Well-Being and Resiliency Survey" (WBRS) which assessed multiple symptomatic and social domains. Results: In total, 232 grade seven and eight students participated in the curriculum over two years with no dropouts. Compared to 362 controls, there were no significant differences in WBRS scores between groups at post or one-year follow-up. Conclusions: This pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of rapid and broad implementation of the intervention. Preliminary analyses showed no indication of effectiveness which may be the product of the intervention being in an interim stage during the study period and/or the retrospective design and limitations in data quality. Specifically, these results suggest that the WBRS may be a suboptimal instrument for measuring the effectiveness of this intervention. A prospective trial of the complete, revised curriculum with validated measures is required to provide an adequately assessment of its impact.

TI  - teen Mental Health First Aid: 12-month outcomes from a cluster crossover randomized controlled trial evaluation of a universal program to help adolescents better support peers with a mental health problem
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: teen Mental Health First Aid (tMHFA) is a universal mental health literacy, stigma reduction, helpseeking, and suicide prevention program designed for adolescents in Years 10-12 of secondary school (16-18 years). tMHFA is delivered by trained instructors, in a regular classroom setting, to increase the knowledge, attitudes and behaviours that adolescents' require to better support peers with mental health problems or mental health crises.Methods: To explore the efficacy of tMHFA, a cluster crossover randomised controlled trial was conducted with Year 10 students in four schools in Victoria, Australia, using physical first aid training as the control intervention. Of the 1942 eligible students, 1,624 completed baseline and 894 completed follow-up surveys. Online surveys, administered one week before training and again 12-months later, included vignettes depicting peers John (depression and suicide risk) and Jeanie (social anxiety/phobia), measures of mental health first aid (quality of first aid intentions, confidence, first aid behaviours provided, and first aid behaviours received), mental health literacy (beliefs about adult help, help-seeking intentions), and stigma (social distance, weak-not-sick, dangerous/unpredictable, and would not tell anyone).Results: The primary outcome-quality of first aid intentions towards the John vignette-showed statistically significant group x time interactions, with tMHFA students reporting more helpful and less unhelpful first aid intentions, than PFA students did over time. Confidence in providing first aid also showed significant interactions. First aid behaviours-both those provided to a peer with a mental health problem and those received from a peer-showed null results. Ratings of both beliefs about adult help and help-seeking intentions were found to be significantly improved among tMHFA students at follow-up. A group x time interaction was found on one stigma scale (would not tell anyone).Conclusions: This trial showed that, one year after training, tMHFA improves first aid intentions towards peers with depression and suicide risk, confidence in helping peers with mental health problems, willingness to tell someone and seek help from an adult or health professional if experiencing a mental health problem.

TI  - Mediating effect of psychological capital on the relationship between mental health literacy and coping styles among newly recruited nurses
T2  - BMC NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundNewly recruited nurses face multiple sources of stress and their coping styles need to be focused on to ensure good mental health. This study aimed to examine the relationship among mental health literacy, psychological capital and coping styles in newly recruited nurses.MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted in August and September 2022. A total of 315 newly recruited nurses were recruited in a tertiary hospital in Henan Province, central China, employing the convenience sampling method. The self-reported questionnaires were sent through a QR code, including the Mental Health Literacy Scale for Healthcare Students, Psychological Capital Questionnaire, and Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire. Pearson correlation analysis was used to evaluate the relationships among the variables. Mediation analysis was performed to identify the mediating effect of psychological capital on the relationship between mental health literacy and coping styles.ResultsPositive coping showed a positive relationship with psychological capital and mental health literacy, while negative coping showed a negative relationship with psychological capital and mental health literacy. For positive coping, psychological capital was a partial mediator with an effect of 0.140, accounting for 62.8%. For negative coping, a full mediating effect was shown by psychological capital between mental health literacy and negative coping, with an indirect effect of -0.048.ConclusionPsychological capital plays a partial and complete mediating role between mental health literacy and different coping styles among newly recruited nurses. Diversified training and personalized guidance in improving mental health literacy and increasing psychological capital simultaneously can be provided to newly recruited nurses continuously to adjust their coping styles.

TI  - A scoping review of mental health literacy in performing and creative artists: identifying current gaps and future directions
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction Mental health literacy is a multifaceted construct that consists of helping individuals recognize the early warning signs of mental health conditions, understanding the concept of stigma and misconceptions associated with mental illness, encouraging appropriate help-seeking behaviors, and facilitating access to mental health services. However, mental health literacy remains a largely unexplored topic in artists' health literature. This scoping review examines the conceptualization, operationalization, and measurement of mental health literacy in performing and creative artists.Methods We conducted a comprehensive search across multiple databases, including MEDLINE, CINAHL, PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Cochrane. Our search was designed to identify articles relevant to mental health literacy among artists, encompassing aspects related to the understanding, identification, and education of mental health conditions. Two independent reviewers conducted both abstract and full-text screenings. Our findings are synthesized using the four components of mental health literacy as a framework for organization.Results Of the 669 unique citations, 26 articles met the inclusion criteria; of these, 23 focused on performing artists. The articles were published between 1997 and 2024, with at least 4,710 participants from nine countries. Only one study included a definition of mental health literacy. Sixteen articles included one of the four components of mental health literacy, nine included two, four included three, and one had all four components.Discussion Despite the high prevalence of mental health challenges among performing and creative artists, there is a disproportionately low number of interventions aimed at increasing mental health literacy compared to other fields, such as sports medicine and education. This highlights the need for more comprehensive efforts to increase awareness and understanding of mental health issues among artists. Furthermore, the lack of consensus on the conceptualization, operationalization, and measurement of mental health literacy in this field prompts further research. A standardized definition and validated instrument could facilitate more robust research on mental health literacy in the artists' health literature and help identify effective interventions. Future research can build on this review to develop and evaluate interventions aiming to improve mental health literacy in artists.

AB  - IntroductionLow levels of mental health literacy amongst parents can have negative effects on youth mental wellbeing and help-seeking behaviors. Here, we explored the impact of a brief psychoeducational workshop on improving parent mental health literacy and family relationships in Kibera, a low-resource high-risk setting in Nairobi, Kenya.MethodsThe workshop was designed to address this issue, and it was delivered by trained facilitators to small groups of parents (N = 72). Data was collected at baseline, post-workshop, two-week follow-up, and one-month follow-up.ResultsStatistical and thematic analysis of the data revealed significant improvements in parent mental health literacy scores and family relationships, indicating the acceptability and effectiveness of this workshop.DiscussionThe findings suggest that brief, group-based psychoeducational workshops can be effective in improving parent mental health literacy and family relationships, thereby addressing challenges faced by parents and youth in the Kenyan context. Future studies are needed to conclusively determine if such workshops can improve participants' own mental health or their perception of child behavior.

TI  - Strengthening the mental health literacy and self-efficacy of school counsellors using "MDAS" module: A pilot project in Malaysia
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGISTS AND COUNSELLORS IN SCHOOLS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mental health difficulties affect children and adolescents pervasively. School counsellors serve as frontliners to support the students in need, but often face challenges from the complexity of their cases. This study aims to develop a training module named MDAS (Mental Health disorder, Developmental disorders, Attachment and Self-compassionate) program to improve the school counsellors' mental health knowledge and counselling self-efficacy. The Module was adapted from Child and Adolescent Mental Health Training Module for Specialist 2009 (Second Edition). The study adopted a one group pre-test/post-test design to assess 28 school counsellors at 0-month and 4-month after the training. The scales used were Counselling Self-Efficacy scale (COSE), Mental Health Literacy Scale (MHLS) and Self-Compassionate Scale - Short Form (SCS-SF). Post-training, there were significant increment of COSE and MHLS scores (p < .001 and p < .046) with Cohen's d of 1.01 and 0.58. Four of the COSE subscales (micro skills, counselling process, cultural competence and dealing with difficult clients' behaviour) significantly increased after MDAS training (p < .001, p = .006, p = .001 and p = .01). In addition to increasing the counselling capacity of school counsellors, our training module can serve as a promising platform for mental health professionals and counsellors.

TI  - Initial effects of Mental Health First Aid training on mental health literacy, social distance, stigma, mental health, and quality of life in the German adult population - Findings from a pilot study
T2  - EUROPEAN PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Despite the high prevalence of mental disorders, knowledge about mental health, its promotion, prevention, and pathways to care in the general population remain limited. Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) seeks to increase mental health literacy in the general population and enable individuals to support others with mental health problems until professional help is available. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility and initial effects of MHFA training on (i) mental health literacy, (ii) stigmatizing attitudes toward individuals with mental health problems, (iii) social distance, (iv) trainees' mental health, and (v) quality of life.Methods In an uncontrolled pilot study, individuals aged 18-75 years who participated in MHFA courses in Germany were recruited. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, post-training, and 6-month follow-up.Results In total, 362 participants (mean age 43 years, 78% female) enrolled in the study at baseline. Retention was about 50% for post-training and 60% for follow-up assessment. At post-training, mental health literacy was increased (adj Beta = 6.77, 95% CI = 5.69 to 7.84) and social distance (adj Beta = -2.30, 95% CI = -2.73 to -1.87) and stigmatizing attitudes (adj Beta = -2.61, 95% CI = -3.25 to -1.97) were reduced. These effects were also evident at 6-month follow-up. There were no effects on trainees' mental health. At the 6-month follow-up, 89% of trainees had talked to someone with mental health problems at least once, and 65% of trainees were quite or very confident in offering help.Conclusions Our findings suggest initial beneficial effects of MHFA training as implemented in Germany. A randomized controlled trial of MHFA in Germany is now warranted.

TI  - The effectiveness of mental health literacy interventions in young people: a meta-analysis
T2  - MENTAL HEALTH REVIEW JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose - Adolescence and young adulthood are recognised as critical time for developing mental health literacy (MHL). The purpose of this study is to analyse the effectiveness of current MHL interventions to guide the future development of MHL intervention strategies.Design/methodology/approach - A meta-analysis adopting the PRISMA framework for systematically reviewing the literature was adopted. Three authors independently reviewed studies and extrapolated key data for analysis. A robust random-effects model with adjustments for small study biases was conducted to establish the effect sizes of all included MHL interventions. Moderator analysis was conducted to examine the effects of intervention length in MHL.Findings - A total of 11 intervention studies were identified and analysed, resulting in a medium to large pooled effect size of 0.62 (95% CI: 0.28; 0.96). Moderator analysis found that short interventions had an estimated standard mean difference (SMD) effect size of 0.9220 (95% CI: - 1.1555; 2.9995). This was greater than the medium length interventions, with an estimated SMD effect size of 0.4967 (95% CI: 0.0452; 0.9483), and long interventions, with an estimated SMD effect size of 0.5628 (95% CI: - 0.2726; 1.3983). As a result, MHL interventions are proficient in improving young adults' MHL, with shorter interventions (45-50min) having the largest effect size. This study highlights several inconsistencies in methodological rigour and reporting from studies in this area, which future research should look to address.Originality/value - To date, MHL review studies have often focused their attention on a specific domain, most notably education and school-based setting. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no reviews have conducted a meta-analysis across contexts and domains with a specific focus on MHL intervention strategies for young adults.

TI  - "I'm Not Alone": Exploring Southeast Asian American High School Students' Experiences in a Mental Health Literacy Intervention
T2  - ASIAN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The mental health needs of Southeast Asian American high school students are often overlooked, despite the significant challenges they face, including intergenerational trauma, stigma, and limited access to mental health resources. The authors conducted a phenomenological study to explore the lived experiences of Southeast Asian American high school students who participated in a culturally tailored mental health literacy intervention. Seven students participated with six identified as Hmong American and one identified as Chinese Vietnamese American. Thematic data analysis was used to explore and code the data. Through semistructured interviews with seven participants, this study identified five key themes: (a) improved mental health knowledge, (b) openness to talk about mental health, (c) empathy and perspective-taking, (d) help-seeking and coping, and (e) community and connection. Findings revealed that the mental health literacy intervention fostered improved mental health knowledge, reduced stigma, and strengthened participants' confidence in seeking help for themselves and others. Additionally, participants reported a heightened sense of empathy and connection to their peers, highlighting the importance of culturally responsive approaches to mental health. We discuss limitations and implications for this understudied community.

TI  - Elite athlete initiatives in school mental health: crafting an art-based educational methodology for promoting mental health help-seeking
T2  - DISCOVER MENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Art-based practices have been expected and incorporated into adolescent mental health education, enhanced by their potential to promote positive psychosocial development and foster resilience. Elite athletes, while encountering similar challenges as adolescents-such as reluctance to seek psychological support-occupy a distinctive position due to their capacity to exert substantial influence on youth. This paper presents the development and conceptualization of a novel, elite athlete-led mental health education framework that employs artistic expression as a core modality. We showed and explained the 'Yowai-wa-Tsuyoi Project' ('Weakness is Strength'), an initiative undertaken in Japan that seeks to harness the personal narratives of elite athletes to effect positive change in adolescents' mental health literacy. By collaborating with the Japan Rugby Players Association and mental health experts, the project integrates art-based interventions to stimulate dialogue on mental health, stress, and overall well-being. By sharing their lived experiences, athletes facilitate art-driven activities wherein students are encouraged to express and reflect upon their mental health experiences. This interdisciplinary initiative aspires to enhance adolescents' understanding of mental health through relatable athlete role models, foster emotional articulation via artistic media, and nurture empathy and collective support for mental well-being. The integration of sports, education, and art in this approach illustrates a potentially transformative model for engaging adolescents in critical discourse surrounding mental health and well-being. Furthermore, it underscores the importance of creating educational environments that embrace vulnerability, expression, and dialogue, thus providing students with the tools and space to address their mental health in a supportive context.

TI  - Exploring what works in mental health education for health profession students: a realist review
T2  - BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Mental health education is essential for preparing healthcare professionals to address the growing needs of patients with mental health challenges. The aim of this study was to understand the current landscape of teaching and learning approaches to mental health education for undergraduate health profession students.MethodologyA realist review was chosen to explore what works for whom, how, and why in teaching and learning for mental health education for undergraduate health profession students. The search strategy was developed iteratively, with support from a research librarian, and additional searches supplemented the initial search. Following screening in duplicate, the selected studies were appraised for relevance, richness and rigour. Intervention (I), Context (C), Actor (A), Mechanism (M) and Outcome (O) configurations were extracted from the data and analysed for patterns and conceptual areas. Stakeholder and Patient and Public Involvement panels supported the refinement of both the Initial Programme Theory (IPT) and Programme Theories (PT).Results78 articles were included. The results identified three critical program theories: (1) direct contact with individuals with lived experience (2), longitudinal and integrative learning approach, and (3) diversity of experiential and community-engaged learning. Integrating these theories into health education curricula may lead to professionals better prepared to address mental health challenges.ConclusionOur realist review identified three critical programme theories for teaching and learning strategies that foster this literacy, including direct engagement with individuals who have lived experiences, a longitudinal and integrative approach to education, and a diverse array of experiential and community-engaged learning opportunities.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SCHOOL NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - School nurses play a key role in supporting student mental health, and many school nurses report the need for additional mental health education. The Mental Health Training Intervention for Health Providers in Schools (MH-TIPS) is a training and implementation support system for school nurses to enhance their skills in promoting student mental health. The current study evaluated the feasibility of the MH-TIPS online curriculum for school nurses, and its impact on their preparedness and ability to support student mental health. Participants included 1,282 registered nurses and nurse practitioners. Descriptive statistics indicated that MH-TIPS online was feasible, relevant, and accessible for school nurses and helped them support student mental health. School nurses reported significant improvements in their preparedness to conduct brief mental health interventions with students and motivate students to seek help. MH-TIPS online is a promising tool to increase the ability of school nurses to support student mental health.

TI  - Improving mental health literacy in adolescents: systematic review of supporting intervention studiesMots-cles
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective Mental health literacy (MHL) in adolescents is an important issue as it can lead to early detection and recognition of mental illness. The aim of this systematic review was to explore the effect of supporting interventions on improving MHL in adolescents. Methods Systematic literature review by searching the ScienceDirect, Scopus, PubMed, Crochrane and CINAHL databases. Seven of 1107 papers were included in the final review. Results Supporting interventions for improving MHL in adolescents could be categorised into school-based and community-based. Both types used an education stand-alone strategy or an education plus contact-based group in their programmes. To provide knowledge of mental illness to adolescents, teaching methods should be interactive and use various media such as group discussion, videos and movies. Conclusions School-based and community-based interventions were likely to improve MHL among adolescents. However, further research with objective tool measures is needed to confirm the findings.

TI  - Improving the Capacity of Non-Physician Primary Care Providers to Address Child and Youth Mental Health Through Mental Health Literacy Approaches
T2  - JOURNAL OF PRIMARY CARE AND COMMUNITY HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction and Objectives: Canadians rely on their primary care providers to address their mental health needs, but there are longstanding system gaps that must be addressed to enhance their ability to deliver mental health care. The present study addressed the gap in pediatric mental health care through the development, delivery, and evaluation of a mental health literacy training among non-physician primary care providers. Methods: We delivered the training among 97 participants, with all completed the pre-test survey, and 74 completed the post-test survey on knowledge, attitudes toward mental health, and help-seeking intentions. Additionally, participants explained why they attended the training and shared how they would apply the knowledge learned into their practice (behaviors). Results: Participants improved their knowledge significantly from pre-test to post-test, P < .001, d = 2.51. We didn't find any statistical significance between pre-test and post-test on attitudes, P = .067, nor on help-seeking intentions, P = .274. However, participants' scores were exceedingly high on both outcomes, indicating positive attitudes and intentions at 2 time points and implying a ceiling effect of both outcomes. We did not find outcome differences by demographics, practice year, practice zone, or professional role. While knowledge, years of practice and prior mental health training predicted participants attitudes at pre-test, they didn't at post-test. Attitudes toward mental health predicted help-seeking intentions. Participants indicated this training will change their practice behaviors. Conclusion: This mental health literacy training for primary care providers demonstrated strong evidence of the need to integrate mental health and addiction support into primary care practice.

TI  - "Young People Come to Youth Workers First": A Mixed Methods Evaluation of the Role of Youth Workers in Youth Psychosis Detection
T2  - EARLY INTERVENTION IN PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Reducing the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) is a cornerstone of effective early intervention for psychosis (EIP) services. Delays in help seeking are a significant component of DUP, particularly among youth. Given their role as trusted adults in young people's lives, youth workers are uniquely positioned to play a role in early detection networks. However, their views regarding this remain largely unexamined. Aim This study aimed to explore youth workers' perspectives on identifying and responding to psychosis in youth and the training needed to support them in this role. Methods A sequential-independent mixed methods design was employed. A brief questionnaire was given to youth workers (n = 86) who attended a 1-day EIP training session, followed by semi-structured interviews with a subset of participants (n = 10) 3 months later. Results Most participants (98.8%) expressed confidence in recognising psychosis; however, stigma and challenging relationships with mental health services emerged as systemic barriers. Although most participants (98.8%) found the EIP training relevant to their role, they suggested it should form part of a broader mental health curriculum. There was a clear consensus among participants that such training is necessary and should be accessible, practical and actionable. Conclusion Youth workers are uniquely positioned in identifying and supporting young people at risk of psychosis, and this study underscores their willingness to take on this role. To best support them, training efforts should focus on trans-diagnostic approaches that enhance mental health literacy, address systemic barriers and promote multidisciplinary partnerships.

TI  - Mental Health Literacy Programs for Parents of Adolescents: A Systematic Review
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: Many mental illnesses begin during adolescence. Parents of adolescents need to have sufficient mental health literacy (MHL) to recognize mental health problems in their children and to assist them with help-seeking. Although several educational programs have been developed to enhance parental MHL, their effectiveness has not been established. This study provides a systematic review for the effectiveness of MHL programs in parents of adolescents.Methods: PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC and Web of Science were searched from the earliest date possible until February 2022; references of studies which met eligibility criteria were also screened. Studies that assessed quantitative change in at least one of the following components of parental MHL were included: knowledge of mental health/illnesses; stigma toward people with mental health problems; confidence in helping children with mental health problems, and intention, knowledge or behavior of helping children with mental health problems. Risk of bias (ROB) for each outcome within the included studies was rated using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Nonrandomized Studies for nonrandomized studies.Results: Nine studies (four RCTs, three controlled before-and-after studies, and two case series), reported in 10 articles, were included. Mental health knowledge and/or confidence was significantly improved in several studies, while no studies observed significant improvement in stigma and/or intention/behavior of helping children. ROB was high in five out of nine studies (10 out of 18 outcomes) and unclear in the others.Conclusions: A limited number of studies have evaluated effects of MHL program in parents and inconsistent quality contributes to difficulty in establishing their overall effectiveness. More studies with appropriate methods of recruitment, measurement and analysis, and transparent reporting are needed.

TI  - Strength-based capacity-building interventions to promote adolescents' mental health: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - EUROPEAN CHILD & ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Review
AB  - Strength-based capacity-building interventions have the potential to enhance an individual's capacity to improve their mental health. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to examine the effectiveness of these interventions on mental health literacy, resilience, self-efficacy, and positive thinking in adolescents without pre-existing mental/psychiatric diagnoses/conditions. CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and CNKI were searched from inception to June 2024. Two reviewers independently conducted the study screening, risk of bias assessment, and data extraction. Leave-one-out sensitivity and subgroup analyses were used to reduce the heterogeneity of the studies and their findings. Forty-seven interventional studies were included, with approaches mainly consisting of psychoeducation, individual skill training (e.g., emotional regulation, mindfulness), and supportive peer feedback. Capacity-building interventions (in 27 studies) improved the levels of mental health literacy (SMD = 1.70, 95% CI[0.57, 2.84], I-2 = 97%, n = 4) and resilience (SMD = 0.51, 95% CI[0.26, 0.76], I-2 = 89%, n = 16) in the short-term (< 1 month) and resilience in the long-term (> 6 months; SMD = 0.29, 95% CI[0.03, 0.55], I-2 = 39%, n = 3) post-intervention. While there were limited studies evaluated on positive thinking and self-efficacy and thus unable to perform meta-analysis on these outcomes, the medium-term effects on resilience show no statistical significance (1-6 months; n = 4). However, the effects on depression and anxiety were nonsignificant. Combined approaches to capacity-building interventions that incorporate two or more theoretical frameworks/models within one intervention could enhance adolescents' resilience (SMD = 0.24, 95% CI[0.13, 0.35], I-2 = 22%, n = 3). Combining positive psychology with other mental health approaches in interventions might boost adolescents' resilience in short-term but there were limited studies and thus insufficient evidence to evaluate the medium- and long-term effectiveness of these combined approaches. Further rigorous large-scale randomized controlled trials are recommended to provide stronger evidence.

AB  - Objective Mental illness is a common medical condition to onset during adolescence. Young people who leave for postsecondary life are at an especially challenging period of lifetime when many will leave home and familiar environments for prolonged periods of time. These new circumstances may put young people at risk of developing mental health problems or disorders or exacerbate existing mental disorders. Alternatively, some young people may misinterpret the normal negative emotional states occurring as a result of these new challenges as a mental disorder requiring professional intervention. We conducted a quasiexperimental cohort study to investigate the effectiveness of a mental health literacy intervention Transitions with blended life skills to address these challenges for first-year postsecondary students. Methods Students (n = 2,397) from five Canadian postsecondary institutions were assigned to the intervention or the control group and were administered a survey at baseline, postintervention, and at 2-month follow-up (September 2017 to February 2018). We applied generalized linear mixed effects (PROC Mixed procedure) to test the between-group difference in the post-pre/follow-up-pre and to determine the predicted least-square mean values. Results The findings showed that students who were exposed to the Transitions intervention significantly improved their mental health knowledge, decreased stigma against mental illness, improved help-seeking attitudes and behaviours, and decreased perceived stress when compared to students who had not been exposed to the intervention. However, we did not identify significant changes in general health. This may be due to the relatively short follow-up time (2 months) to determine participants' general health status. Conclusions Transitions delivered to first-year postsecondary students may be a beneficial intervention to help young people adjust to their new postsecondary life and improve their mental health.

TI  - Assessing mental health literacy in Jordan: a factor analysis and Rasch analysis study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Mental health literacy (MHL) research in Jordan is sparse and validated MHL measures are lacking. The present study validated a Jordanian version of the Mental Health Literacy Scale (MHLS) and examined Jordanian individuals' MHL.Method A Google Forms survey was designed, and the link was shared through various Jordanian social media platforms. Factor analysis and Rasch analysis were performed to validate the Jordanian version of the MHLS. Binary logistic regression was performed to assess variables associated with MHL.Results The Jordanian MHLS was administered to 974 participants (74.4% females; median age 27 years). The mean MHL score of the participants was 71.1% indicating average literacy levels. The factor analysis indicated that 27 items distributed across four factors had the best model fit. The Rasch analysis confirmed item separation reliability and person reliability. The regression showed a correlation between educational attainment, income, marital status and MHL level. These findings emphasize the role of educational attainment in MHL, pointing to the necessity of integrating mental health education into formal curricula to enhance MHL across all societal levels. Stigma and limited-service availability act as barriers to mental health service and access, which compound the challenge of improving MHL. Targeted educational interventions and policy reforms may help improve MHL, thereby contributing to improving mental health outcomes in Jordan and potentially other similar settings.

AB  - This study was to investigate the effects of mental health literacy and human rights sensitivity of nursing students on social distance in people with mental disorders. The participants comprised 208 nursing students from 5 universities located in Seoul and Gyeonggi-do. Data were collected using self-report questionnaires from May to June 2019. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Independent t-tests, Pearson's correlation coefficient, and stepwise multiple regression. As a result of this study, mental health literacy was 11.50 out of 16, human rights sensitivity was 55.03 out of 75, and social distancing was 23.85 out of 40. The factors affecting social distance were human rights sensitivity (β=.301, p<.01), mental illness education experience (β=306, p<.01), and mental health literacy (β=125, p=.05); the explanatory power of the model was 19.5%. Therefore, in order to alleviate social distance towards people with mental disorders, it is necessary to improve mental health literacy and human rights sensitivity of nursing students, and the systematic education strategy and education program should be developed and applied.

TI  - Evidence based consensus statements for digital tools to address youth mental health literacy
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mental health disorders typically emerge in early life and can be modified through prompt intervention. Mental health literacy is the multi-dimensional knowledge of mental health disorders to recognize, manage, or prevent mental health disorders. Enhancing youth mental health literacy through information communication technologies already adopted by youth may be an accessible and effective approach to address the ongoing mental health crisis. We used an interconnected, three phase process following co-design methods to determine evidence-based consensus statements to conceptualize and develop the Youth MindTrack and to inform future digital tools to support youth mental health literacy. In Phase I, a scientific team (N = 21; 24% youth) adhered to deliberative dialogue and priority setting methods to develop strategic priorities. Phase II consisted of a modified Delphi consensus process to determine evidence-based consensus statements (N = 352 (13% youth) Round 1; N = 87 (33% youth) Round 2). Semi-structured focus groups in Phase III were conducted to refine the consensus statements (N = 16, 25% youth) and design the digital mental health literacy tool (N = 24, 33% youth). Twenty-one consensus statements encompassing four domains were produced: (1) Understanding mental health (N = 4); (2) Exercising mental health (N = 6); (3) Engaging with digital support (N = 8); and (4) Evaluating digital support (N = 3). Content analysis of discussions identified 16 themes mapped to the domains of mental health literacy and user-interface, design considerations for digital tools on mental health literacy more broadly. The resulting design of the Youth MindTrack tool to support mental health literacy included four main interactive sections designed to be downloaded and completed by youth on a digital device. We determined 21 evidence-based consensus statements that underpinned the conceptualization and development of the Youth MindTrack: a downloadable digital tool to support youth mental health literacy. The data supports proceeding to pilot testing to assess the tool's usability, acceptability, and perceived effectiveness prior to implementation, and provides evidence that an iterative and participatory research-based process with youth can help adapt health technology to their needs.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - As a global public health problem, adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) is an important factor leading to serious psychological and behavioral problems in children and adolescents. Mental health service plan based on mental health service needs is the key to effectively improve the psychological problems of children and adolescents with ACEs. Emotional support, life skills training, mental health education, and individualized psychological intervention can effectively improve the mental health of children and adolescents with ACEs. Among them, emotional support is an important way to help individual reduce psychological and behavioral problems; secondly, life skills training can significantly improve the individual's psychosocial ability; and mental health education is a necessary way to promote the development of individual mental health. Individualized psychological intervention can promote individual to obtain more professional mental health service and improve their psychological symptoms, which is crucial for preventing the occurrence of mental health problems. Future research can develop targeted mental health interventions based on the specific mental health service needs.
AB  - 童年不良经历(adverse childhood experiences，ACEs)作为全球普遍存在的公共卫生问题，是导致儿童和青少年出现严重心理行为问题的重要因素。基于心理健康服务需求制订的心理健康服务方案是有效改善ACEs儿童和青少年心理问题的关键所在。情感支持、生活技能训练、心理健康教育和个性化心理干预等能够有效地提高ACEs儿童和青少年的心理健康水平。其中，情感支持是帮助个体减少心理行为问题的重要方式，生活技能训练能够显著提高个体的心理社会能力，心理健康教育可促进个体的心理健康发展。个性化心理干预能够促使个体获得更专业的心理健康服务，改善其心理症状，对于预防心理健康问题的发生至关重要。未来研究可根据ACEs个体特定的心理健康服务需求开发有针对性的心理健康干预方案。.

TI  - Improving mental health by improving the mental health literacy? Study protocol for a randomised controlled evaluation of an e-mental health application as a preventive intervention for adolescents and young adults
T2  - INTERNET INTERVENTIONS-THE APPLICATION OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN MENTAL AND BEHAVIOURAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: From the age of 14, many adolescents enter a vulnerable developmental phase, with a sharp increase in mental illness at 16. The COVID19 pandemic has further exacerbated this issue. Hence, universal and easily accessible prevention in the young is needed. E-mental health interventions are on the rise due to numerous benefits such as potential low-costs, low-threshold and high scalability. However, effectiveness and acceptance of mobile health (mHealth) preventive interventions remain unresearched. Method: In a two-armed, randomised controlled study design adolescents and young adults from 14 years old will be recruited. Following an initial baseline assessment, they will be randomised to a) the intervention group (IG, n = 75), which will receive a mHealth intervention (the application 'Mental Health Guide', co-developed by lived experience experts) or b) the waiting list control group (CG, n = 75). Both groups will be followed up after 3 and 6 months following post assessment. We hypothesize an increase in mental health literacy in the IG compared to the CG for post and follow-up assessment (primary outcome: Mental Health Literacy Scale). In addition, we expect an improvement in mental health and psychological well-being, improved emotion regulation, reduced psychological distress, as well as good quality ratings in usability and acceptance in the use of the 'Mental Health Guide' We performed multiple simulations of possible outcome scenarios, incorporating an array of factors, to generate realistic datasets and obtain accurate estimates of statistical power. Conclusion: As a first-of-its-kind in this field, this study investigates whether a mHealth intervention based on mental health literacy may improve the mental health literacy and further aspects of psychological functioning of young people in a vulnerable phase. Furthermore, the results promise to provide important knowledge of how universal prevention may be implemented with low costs for diverse populations. Trial registration: This trial was registered in the DRKS register (DRKS-ID: DRKS00031810) on 23 June 2023.

T2  - SUPPORT FOR LEARNING
M3  - Article
AB  - This research is an evaluation of a six-week mental health literacy programme, referred to as the Cambridge United Community Trust's 'Mind Your Head' programme, which was delivered by sports professionals to secondary school students (11-16) in Cambridge, England, during 2017-18. A Mental Health Literacy Scale was used to measure students' knowledge of mental health issues pre- and post-intervention. Statistical data from these surveys were analysed using an independent samples t-test. Focus groups were held with students in each school, and individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with one lead teacher in each school. The statistical data indicate that statistically significant improvements in mental health literacy were achieved, and this occurred across all genders and ethnicities. The qualitative data suggest that this programme resulted in positive attitudes towards mental health and improved knowledge of how to seek help. The data indicate that investment in similar programmes would be beneficial for schools in improving students' knowledge of mental health and reducing stigma.

T2  - COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Disparities in mental health care and access to care disproportionately affect youth from minoritized and low-income communities. School-based prevention programs have the potential to offer a non-stigmatized approach to mental health care as well as the ability to reach many students simultaneously. Advocates 4 All Youth (ALLY) is a program developed for 5-6th grade students aimed at improving self-efficacy and resilience via individualized sessions with a trusted adult (ALLYs). The feasibility of delivering ALLY in a racially and minoritized low-income community is discussed and modifications required to implement the program documented. Students completed questionnaires and sessions with an ALLY. Aspects of program delivery deemed feasible included training ALLYs to delivery program, stakeholder buy-in regarding missing class time, and students attending the sessions. Further modifications included adjustments to materials due to lower reading level and health literacy related-educational needs. Programs designed in one demographic setting may not work in a different setting.

TI  - Mental health training for Australian undergraduate paramedic science students: a review
T2  - JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH TRAINING EDUCATION AND PRACTICE
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to present the current state of evidence regarding the mental health literacy of paramedics and student paramedics and whether mental health literacy affects the care that paramedics provide to their patients with mental illness. Design/methodology/approach Embase, PubMed, Medline and Google Scholar were searched for recent (2010-2020) English language published articles using the key phrases paramedic AND/OR ambulance AND mental health AND mental health literacy. Additional searches of the reference lists of included articles were undertaken. A descriptive thematic analysis was used to arrive at a narrative synthesis of the study findings. Findings The emergency medical services system has taken a primary role in the care of patients with mental illness but has limited capacity for non-emergency psychosocial situations. Negative and judgemental attitudes amongst paramedics towards patients with mental illness is a significant issue and remains a barrier to patients seeking medical care for mental illness. Improved care provision and patient engagement might result from specific education aimed to better enhance paramedics' mental health literacy. Originality/value This literature review provides insights into the current practice of mental health training for Australian undergraduate paramedic science students and the implications for patient care. Recommendations for educational strategies are provided.

TI  - The effect of web-based educational interventions on mental health literacy, stigma and help-seeking intentions/attitudes in young people: systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - BMC PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Review
AB  - ObjectivesThis study aims to provide a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature on The Effect of Web-Based Educational Interventions on Mental Health Literacy, Stigma and Help-seeking intentions/attitudes in young people.MethodsArticles in English published between April 1975 and February 2023 were retrieved from seven databases, leading to a total of 2023 articles identified.Results20 studies were included after applying exclusion criteria, 10 of which were eligible for meta-analysis. Results showed that web-based educational interventions had a significant positive effect on mental health literacy knowledge (SMD = 0.70, 95% CI = [0.16, 1.25]), but not on stigma (SMD = -0.20, 95% CI = [-0.48, 0.08]) or help-seeking intentions/attitudes (SMD = 0.48, 95% CI = [-0.50, 1.46]).ConclusionThis study reviewed and analyzed the effect of web-based educational interventions on mental health literacy, stigma, and help-seeking intentions/attitudes among young people. The results showed that web-based educational interventions improved mental health literacy knowledge, but not stigma or help-seeking outcomes. The study suggested several recommendations to enhance the effectiveness of web-based educational interventions on stigma and help-seeking outcomes, such as using more rigorous designs and methods, more comprehensive and multifaceted interventions, more tailored and targeted interventions, and more collaborative and participatory approaches. The study concluded that web-based educational interventions may have a greater impact on reducing stigma and promoting help-seeking among young people, which may ultimately lead to better mental health outcomes and well-being for this population.

TI  - Are attitudes, mental health literacy and clinical characteristics predischarge related to perceived stigma reported by adolescents discharged from inpatient psychiatry?
T2  - PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Psychiatric illness and stigma are serious global concerns. Adolescents with psychiatric illness represent a vulnerable group. The purpose for this study was to explore the associations of attitudes toward people with mental illness, mental health literacy and clinical characteristics captured while adolescent patients were hospitalized with the patients' perceived stigma encountered post-discharge. Psychiatrist-reported less improvement in functioning was associated with perceived personal rejection, and patient-reported severity of symptoms was associated with perceived secrecy. Inpatients who do not display good improvement in functioning while in hospital may benefit from specialized intervention such as cognitive behavioural therapy during and after their hospital stay.

TI  - Mental health issues and the association of mental health literacy among adolescents in urban Ethiopia
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Epidemiological evidence about the prevalence of adolescent mental health issues and their association with mental health literacy is crucial for sustained mental health promotion strategies. Adolescence is a critical life stage for mental health promotion. However, evidence is not available among Ethiopian school adolescents. Hence, the present study examined the prevalence of adolescents' mental health issues and their correlation with mental health literacy. Materials and methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among adolescents (grades 5-12) in Dire Dawa city, Eastern Ethiopia using multistage random sampling. Data was collected using the Strength and Difficulty Questionnaire, WHO-5 well-being index, and mental health literacy questionnaire. SPSS version 25 was used for the descriptive, Chi-square, binary logistic regression, and correlation analyses. Results Between 14.0-24.5% of adolescents had reported mental health problems: internalizing problems (14.9-28.8%), emotional problems (10.4-25.5%), and peer relationship problems (17.8-25.5%). These mental health problems were significantly greater among adolescents who had either themselves or their family members used psychoactive substances (p <= 0.05). Females from upper elementary (5-8 grade) and lower secondary (9-10) grade levels had a higher prevalence of mental health problems (AOR: 2.60 (0.95-7.10, p<0.05)). The effect of age, parental education, or employment status was insignificant (p>0.05). The prevalence of depression ranged from 18.0-25.5%. Mental health literacy was negatively correlated with total difficulties scores and positively associated with mental well-being scores (p<0.05). Conclusion The prevalence of adolescents' mental health problems was higher. It implied that promoting mental health literacy could enhance adolescents' positive mental health. Intervention programs should prioritize vulnerable groups and individuals reporting symptoms of mental health difficulties. Future studies should involve qualitative studies and consider effect of other determinants.

TI  - The effectiveness of a "EspaiJove.net"- a school-based intervention programme in increasing mental health knowledge, help seeking and reducing stigma attitudes in the adolescent population: a cluster randomised controlled trial
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The aim of this study is to evaluate the short- and long-term effects of the universal mental health literacy intervention "EspaiJove.net " in increasing mental health knowledge, help seeking and reducing stigma attitudes in the adolescent population. We also examine whether these effects depend on the intervention intensity. Methods: A clustered school-based randomised controlled trial (cRCT) design. Subjects: 1,298 secondary pupils aged 13 and 14 were recruited from 18 schools in Barcelona (Spain) between September 2016 and January 2018. Intervention: Three programmes were assessed: 1) Sensitivity Programme (SP; 1 h); 2) Mental Health Literacy (MHL; 6 h); 3) MHL plus a first-person Stigma Reduction Programme (MHL + SR; 7 h); 4) Control group (CG): waiting list. Outcome measures: 1) MHL: EspaiJove.net EMHL Test (First part and Second Part); 2) Stigma: RIBS and CAMI; 3) Help-seeking and use of treatment: GHSQ. Analysis: The data was collected at baseline, post-intervention and 6 and 12 months later. An intention-to-treat analysis and imputation method was used to analyse the missing data. Intervention effects were analysed using multilevel modelling. Results: One thousand thirty-two students were included (SP = 225; MHL = 261; MHL + SR = 295 and CG = 251). The MHL and MHL + SR interventions showed short- and long-term an increase in knowledge compared to SP and CG, but no significant change post-intervention or over time (First part p = 0.52 and Second part p = 0.62) between intervention groups and CG. No significant changes were found in stigma scores post-intervention or over time (CAMI p = 0.61 and RIBS p = 0.98) or in help-seeking scores (parent p = 0.69; teacher p = 0.23 and healthcare professional p = 0.75). The MHL + SR intervention was the best valued and recommended (p < 0.005). Conclusions: The three interventions of the EspaiJove.net programme (SP, MHL and MHL + SR) seem not to be effective in terms MHL, Stigma and help-seeking behaviours. The contact with a person who has experimented mental illness first-hand did not reduce stigma attitudes. Further research should deal with the heterogeneity of MHL interventions (concept, duration and measures) and identify which components of stigma interventions are effective.

TI  - Kua takoto te mānuka, mā wai e hiki ake? Advancing a Te Tiriti o Waitangi-led approach to mental health education in schools
T2  - KOTUITUI-NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES ONLINE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article engages matauranga Maori, social psychology and the sociology of education to argue that an individualistic approach to mental health education in schools is inadequate. In this article we discuss a recent national school curriculum policy that demonstrates the ways mental health education can be framed by Te Tiriti o Waitangi, informed by the determinants of health, and culturally located in worldviews representative of Te Ao Maori. This framework encourages schools take a 'whole of school' approach to mental health education, embedded in teacher development, curriculum learning, and community engagement. We argue that this approach - aligned with the three articles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi - necessarily involves schools consulting with diverse akonga (learners) and communities, involving them in mental health curriculum development, implementation, and evaluation. When conducted in culturally and socially conscious ways, the relationship between boards, schools and the wider school community can embody effective governance (article one), honour hapu, iwi and Maori rangatiratanga (article two) and encourage equal participation and inclusion for equitable mental health education and outcomes (article three). We argue that this approach to mental health is Te Tiriti-led, relational, and more likely to be well-being enhancing for diverse young people and communities.

TI  - Modifiable predictors of mental health literacy in the educational context: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - BMC PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Mental health literacy is vital for well-being in educational settings, extending beyond academics to include social and emotional development. It empowers individuals, allowing them to recognize and address their mental health needs and provide essential support to their peers. Despite the acknowledged importance of modifiable factors, there is a noticeable research gap in those amenable to change through educational interventions. Thus, this systematic review aims to identify potentially modifiable predictors of mental health literacy in the educational context. A systematic search was conducted for quantitative studies published between 2019 and October 2023 using several databases following PRISMA guidelines. Studies needed to focus on potentially modifiable predictors of mental health literacy in the educational context. Study quality was assessed using the Appraisal tool for Cross-Sectional Studies (AXIS tool). In total, 3747 titles and abstracts were screened, 60 articles were assessed in full-text screening, and 21 were included in the review. Significant correlations between mental health literacy and modifiable predictors, including stigma toward professional help, self-efficacy, attitudes toward help-seeking, social support, positive psychological states, receiving mental health training, and psychological distress, were identified. By addressing these factors, educational institutions can cultivate community's adept in mental health, fostering an environment marked by empathy, understanding, and proactive engagement in addressing mental health issues. The implications serve as a foundation for future research, policy development, and implementing of practical strategies to enhance mental health literacy in diverse educational settings.

TI  - HSN-helping in mental distress: a new emotion focused psychological first aid program
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Psychological first aid programs aim to train lay people to help others who are experiencing a mental health crisis or developing mental health problems. The current article introduces the new German psychological first aid training program HSN. The acronym HSN stands for "Helfen in Seelischer Not" (helping in mental distress) but also for the action chain "hear, speak, network." The HSN program differs from other well-examined mental health first aid programs by (1) focusing primarily on emotions instead of disorders, (2) using a blended approach, combining face-to-face and online elements right from the start of the project and (3) a low-threshold approach with a course duration of two hours. Here we specify the HSN concept and report first results from a sample of 150 students. The participating students completed a self-report questionnaire before and after the course regarding their "confidence to help." The program demonstrated good feasibility without any relevant side effects. On a descriptive level we observed an improvement of the averaged values of all questionnaire items after the course. These positive initial results merit the further development of HSN as a low-threshold psychological first aid program.

TI  - Assessing mental health literacy among Danish adolescents - development and validation of a multifaceted assessment tool (the Danish MeHLA questionnaire)
T2  - PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - It is recognized that mental health literacy is vital in both the prevention of mental health problems and in mental health promotion and empowerment of adolescents. In spite of this, only a limited number of tools assessing mental health literacy among adolescents have been developed and most of these have not been adequately tested. In this study, a questionnaire assessing mental health literacy was developed and tested using a three-step approach: 1) item generation in which the principles of public patient involvement were essential, 2) item testing and 3) exploration of psychometric properties. Internal consistency of the questionnaire was determined through Cronbach's alpha and confirmatory factor analysis was conducted in order to determine the construct validity of the questionnaire. The results demonstrated partly skewed data, good internal consistency, good Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin and acceptable results in the goodness of fit index. The initial results suggest that the questionnaire developed and validated in this study is valuable in assessing mental health literacy and could provide useful, essential information on the topic. It thus appears to be a promising tool in the promotion and improvement of mental health and early intervention of mental health problems among adolescents.

T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGISTS AND COUNSELLORS IN SCHOOLS
M3  - Article
AB  - Many mental illnesses have onset during adolescence, and if untreated may have long-term negative outcomes. Parents and school counsellors can assist adolescents by monitoring for mental illness and facilitating appropriate support. The present study investigated parents' mental health literacy (MHL), preferred views of school counsellor roles, and intention to follow up referrals. Eighty-seven Australian parents of current secondary school students were recruited to an online cross-sectional survey via convenience sampling. Results showed that, on average, parents had good MHL, moderately endorsed school counsellor roles, and were committed to following up referrals. Higher MHL, but not preferred school counsellor roles, predicted intention to follow up referrals to general practitioners and specialised mental health services. Findings support targeted psychoeducational intervention for parents regarding MHL and the role of the school counsellor and directions for future research are discussed.

TI  - Mental health literacy and its relationship with suicidal tendencies mediated by social support in students: a school-based study
T2  - BMC PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Mental health challenges among adolescents have become a critical public health concern, particularly given the increasing prevalence of suicidal behaviours in this age group. While the relationships between mental health literacy, social support, and suicide risk have been studied globally, there is limited evidence from culturally specific contexts, particularly in less urbanized regions of Iran such as Khoy city. This study aimed to investigate mental health literacy) ability to understand and manage their own and others' mental health (and its relationship with suicidal tendencies, mediated by social support, among students. Methods This was a cross-sectional study conducted in 2024 in Khoy city, West-Azerbaijan, Iran. The study included 605 high-school students from six selected schools, who were selected through two-step random sampling. Mental Health Literacy, social support and suicide tendency questionnaires along with demographic information were used for data gathering. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS AMOS Statistics 24 software. A structural equation modeling was employed to evaluate the relationships between the study variables and to test the conceptual framework. Results The structural model results revealed significant direct and indirect associations among the variables. Mental Health Literacy (MHL) positively influenced the social support (beta = 0.135, P = 0.03), while socioeconomic status (SES) also had a positive effect (beta = 0.203, P < 0.001). Social support was found to negatively affect suicide tendency (beta = -0.823, P < 0.001). Although MHL did not directly impact suicide tendency, it had a significant negative indirect effect through social support (beta = -0.112, P = 0.04). SES also indirectly reduced suicide tendency (beta = -0.167, P < 0.001). Living with parents had a direct negative effect on suicide tendency (beta = -0.081, P = 0.04). Conclusions Based on the findings of this study, the importance of integrating mental health literacy into curricula, establishing peer support networks, and strengthening family-school collaboration within existing frameworks such as the WHO Action Plan is emphasized. Furthermore, these results may provide a foundation for developing localized guidelines aimed at enhancing mental health literacy and social support in schools; however, longitudinal and intervention studies are necessary to confirm the effectiveness of these recommendations.

TI  - Important Systemic Factors for Improving Adolescent Mental Health Literacy.
T2  - Iranian journal of psychiatry
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: Mental health literacy is especially important during adolescence and youth, because the peak of the onset of mental disorders occurs in this period. The present study aimed to identify the effective systemic factors for improving Iranian adolescent mental health literacy from the Perspective of policymakers and experts. Method : This qualitative study was performed on 21 policymakers and health literacy/mental health experts since May 2020 to September 2020 in the workplace of the interviewees in Tehran. Purposive sampling (snowball method) was conducted based on experience, expertise, and the willingness to participate in an interview. All interviews were conducted with the presence of the interviewer at the interviewees' workplace in Tehran. The data were collected through semi-structured interviews and analyzed via the conventional content analysis method. Results: Five themes were extracted as systemic factors for improving adolescent mental health literacy. Themes were "mental health literacy training", "integration and coordination of stakeholder organizations", "resources and facilities", "continuous assessment" and "provision of information." Conclusion: Before policy-making and planning to enhance adolescents' knowledge and awareness of mental health issues, it is necessary to attract policymakers' attention to the macro level and identify direct and indirect strategies for the correct implementation of policies adopted in this field.

TI  - Low mental health literacy is associated with depression and anxiety among adults: a population-based survey of 16,715 adults in China
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Mental health literacy is a predictor of health outcomes in psychological distress. However, limited research has explored whether low mental health literacy is associated with recent depression and anxiety. Methods: We used data from the Guangdong Mental Health Survey, a provincial representative and a population-based survey with a multistage stratified cluster random sampling method. We included adults aged 18 and above living in communities from September to December 2021 in Guangdong, China. Eligible participants were those who completed the mental health literacy questionnaire and assessments for depression and anxiety symptoms. We assessed the proportion of individuals with low mental health literacy by categories of psychological symptoms and whether low mental health literacy was associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms in the general population and subgroups. Results: A total of 16,715 adults were included. We found that individuals with more severe symptoms had a greater proportion of low mental health literacy- it went from 89.4% in participants without depression or anxiety to 96.2% in people who co-occurred with depression and anxiety (x(2) = 21.457, P < 0.001). After controlling confounders, low mental health literacy was associated with depression (adjusted Odds Ratio, aOR [95%CI]:2.74 [1.92-4.04]) and anxiety (2.27 [1.49-3.64]) in the total sample, when compared with adequate mental health literacy. Conclusions: This study found a positive association between low mental health literacy and the presence of depression and anxiety. Tackling inadequate mental health literacy may be a key strategy to promote psychological well-being across the lifespan, especially for young adults.

T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveThe prevalence of mental health problems among youth is high, and help seeking behaviour is low. Mental health literacy (MHL) has been suggested as a factor to enhance mental health knowledge and increase help seeking and coping behaviours. Schools have been recognised as an ideal environment for MHL programs to be delivered to reach a wide range of youth. This study aimed to understand the perspectives and experiences of secondary school students after participating in a MHL program, and how findings aligned with the theoretical model the program is based on.MethodThirty-eight participants aged 12-16 years provided feedback through an open-ended questionnaire. The questionnaire comprised seven items to gather participants' experiences and perspectives on the MHL program, including usefulness, ideas for program improvement, impact, and coping strategies. This study was preregistered on the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, Registration Number: ACTRN12621000325808.ResultsReflexive thematic analysis generated three themes and three subthemes from the findings: 1) A safe environment, 2) Perceived positive impact, 2.1) Attitudes towards mental health, 2.2) Coping strategies, 2.3) Need for MHL, and 3) Suggestions for program improvement.ConclusionsThese findings indicate that the school-based program meets the current MHL needs of young people, aligns with the MHL Child Focused theoretical model, and was viewed as beneficial to be incorporated into the education system in future.

TI  - Exploring mechanisms and contexts in a Peer Education Project to improve mental health literacy in schools in England: a qualitative realist evaluation
T2  - HEALTH EDUCATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Poor adolescent mental health calls for universal prevention. The Mental Health Foundation's 'Peer Education Project' equips older students ('peer educators') to teach younger students ('peer learners') about mental health. The peer-led lessons cover defining good and bad mental health, risk and protective factors, self-care, help-seeking and looking after one another. While previous pre-post evaluations have suggested effectiveness, the mechanisms through which the intervention improves mental health literacy remain unclear. We purposively recruited seven secondary schools across England from 2020 to 2022 and collected data through five observations, 12 staff interviews and 15 student focus groups (totalling 134 students; 46 peer educators aged 14-18 years and 88 peer learners aged 11-13 years). Our realist analysis adopted retroductive logic, intertwining deductive and inductive approaches to test the initial programme theory against insights arising from the data. We developed Context-Mechanisms-Outcome configurations related to four themes: (i) modelling behaviours and forming supportive relationships, (ii) relevant and appropriate content, (iii) peer educators feeling empowered and (iV) a school culture that prioritises mental health support. Our refined programme theory highlights key mechanisms, contexts conducive to achieving the outcomes and ways to improve training, recruitment and delivery to maximise effectiveness for similar peer-led initiatives.

AB  - Objective: Law enforcement officers often have contact to persons who show symptoms of mental disorders. Adequately designed training is necessary for developing the best possible practices in policing when coming into contact with mentally ill people, and may help to expand their general knowledge on mental disorders. To achieve a sustainable implementation of training content in daily policing work, the acceptance and proactive integration of methods by the training participants is essential.Method: This study investigates an exemplary modular training curriculum based on a survey with 2,228 German police officers (28.2% female, 71.8% male) concerning their needs and challenges when coming into contact with persons with mental disorders. This empirical end-user driven approach was used to adapt existing training concepts to the current needs and interests of law enforcement personnel in order to maximize compliance.Results: The training program draft includes basic modules which are intended to be of direct interest to all police officers, such as mental disorders with high policing relevance, encountering suicidal patients, (non-directive) communication and de-escalation skills, and mental hygiene in policing. They are arranged in more specialized modules that address specific target group audiences within police forces and the training curriculum provides information about genuine risks and self-protection, trauma sensitivity, and interaction with children and victims among other contents. The self-selectable, modular, and empirically-based continued training program also includes an introduction to local mental health service professionals and networks, trialogue sequences, and situational role play scenarios.Conclusion: Due to frequent contact law enforcement officers have to mentally ill people, improved training designed to maximize knowledge and the integration of trained methods is necessary. Gaining acceptance and proactive support by trainees is ensured through end-user driven implementation of specialized and differentiated up-to-date training programs. Our results showcase how police officers' perspectives on persons with mental illnesses is a main aspect that can and should be used to encourage training course designs. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

TI  - A web-based psychoeducational programme for trauma-related symptoms in Indonesian undergraduate students: a pilot randomized controlled trial
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOTRAUMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Potentially traumatic events (PTEs) are prevalent among Indonesian students. Web-based psychoeducation might increase mental health literacy and reduce barriers to healthcare access. We developed Pulihkan Luka (PL), a web-based psychoeducation programme for Indonesian undergraduate students. This pilot randomized controlled trial assessed the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of PL. Students (N = 130) were randomly assigned to (1) four to seven sessions of PL + Enhanced Usual Care (PL+EUC; n = 64) or (2) EUC only (n = 66). EUC included a leaflet with referral options to available (mental) health services. Participants received baseline, post-intervention, three- and six-month follow-up assessments. Twenty participants from the treatment group were invited to participate in a focus group discussion. The feasibility and acceptability of PL were examined as primary outcomes based on module completion, MT4C-in-Care feasibility survey, IIAQ-ID, and SIN-E-Stress user satisfaction survey. Secondary outcomes included mental health literacy (MHL questionnaire), psychological well-being (WHO-5), help-seeking intention (GHSQ), symptoms of PTSD (PCL-5), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), and insomnia (ISI). The results indicated a high acceptability of PL (90.63% willing to use the intervention and 89.06% satisfied with the intervention). The uptake and adherence to the intervention were high, with 92.18% completing the first module and 75% completing all assigned modules. However, the feasibility was somewhat lower (59.38% reported sufficient energy and time to complete the modules). The PL+EUC group improved significantly more in mental health literacy compared to EUC only from baseline to post-intervention (b = -0.99, t(140) = 3.64, p = .02). The PL+EUC group did not improve more in psychological well-being and help-seeking intentions, PTSD, depression, anxiety, and insomnia compared to EUC only. PL is the first web-based trauma psychoeducation programme in Indonesia, and it was found to be feasible and acceptable for Indonesian undergraduate students, as well as to improve mental health literacy. Trial registration: Thai Clinical Trials Registry identifier: TCTR20230721001.

TI  - What's Up With Everyone? A qualitative study on young people's perceptions of cocreated online animations to promote mental health literacy
T2  - HEALTH EXPECTATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Adolescence and young adulthood are especially critical times to learn about mental health, given that 75% of mental health issues are developed by the age of 24. Animations have great potential to effectively deliver mental health information to young people. A series of five short animated films to promote mental health literacy were created with and for young people in partnership with the multi-award-winning independent animation studio, Aardman Animations. The aim of this study was to explore young people's perceptions of the cocreated animated films. Methods Seven Youth Juries were conducted to capture young people's opinions and recommendations about the content related to mental health literacy and presentation style of the cocreated animated films. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the audio transcripts. Results Many participants reported a view that the animated films had the potential to promote mental health literacy, especially for understanding mental health and reducing stigma. Some recommendations were provided to improve the films, such as including subtitles and having a better transition to the companion website. Conclusion Cocreated animations have great potential to promote the mental health literacy of young people. We hope that the findings from the present study will inform future media development to make them as effective as possible. Patient or Public Contribution Young people were actively involved in the development, production, implementation and evaluation (up to the time before data analysis) of the animated films.

TI  - Effectiveness of a Comprehensive Mental Health Literacy Educational Programme for Junior High School Students: A Randomised Controlled Trial Examining Changes in Their Knowledge, Attitudes, and Behaviour
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: This study evaluated the effectiveness of a comprehensive mental health literacy (MHL) educational programme known as "Sanita" for improving junior high school students' knowledge of mental illness, attitudes towards people with mental health problems, and help-seeking behaviour. Methods: A randomised controlled trial with a parallel-group design was conducted. A total of 125 students (51 in the intervention group and 74 in the control group) received three 50-min classes and completed self-report questionnaires (Mental Illness and Disorder Understanding Scale, MIDUS; Reported and Intended Behaviour Scale, RIBS-J; and an original questionnaire investigating help-seeking behaviour) before and after the programme and three months later. Results: Regarding MIDUS, the post-test and 3-month follow-up test results showed a significant main effect of time-by-group interactions in a linear mixed model. Regarding RIBS-J, the post-test results showed a significant main effect of time-by-group interactions; however, the 3-month follow-up test showed no significant effect. No significant effects of time-by-group interactions were seen in the post-test and 3-month follow-up test results for help-seeking behaviour in a logistic regression-mixed model. Conclusions: The Sanita MHL educational programme was longitudinally effective at improving junior high school students' knowledge of mental illness, although improvements in attitudes and help-seeking behaviour were insufficient.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRIC NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Topic: The concept of mental health literacy (MHL) was defined as the knowledge and beliefs about mental disorders that help in their recognition, management, or prevention. The complexity of interventions to promote adolescents' MHL requires that they be investigated through a process of development, feasibility/piloting, evaluation, and implementation, according to Medical Research Council (MRC) Framework.Purpose: This article aimed to identify the theory that supports the development of a psychoeducational intervention to promote adolescents' MHL in schools, possibly to be developed by mental health and psychiatric nurses.Sources Used: Journal articles, books, reports, and regulations.Conclusions: This theory allows us to design a psychoeducational intervention to promote adolescents' MHL in schools and supports the subsequent phases of the MRC Framework.

TI  - Animal-Assisted Mental Health Education for Veterinary Students
T2  - JOURNAL OF VETERINARY MEDICAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Veterinary students often face mental health challenges due to the demanding nature of their studies and the pressures of adopting to their future profession. To address this issue, an animal-assisted education in mental health (AAE-MH) program was developed and implemented at a veterinary school in Hong Kong. The primary goal of the AAE-MH program was to enhance students' mental health literacy, raise awareness of mental health topics, and improve their help-seeking behavior and overall well-being. By leveraging the students' natural affinity for animals, the program incorporated a blend of course-based and experiential learning activities to tackle the often-taboo topic of mental health in the veterinary field. The AAE-MH program consisted of six sessions, each lasting 1 hour and 50 minutes. Two of these sessions involved 1 hour of learning from certified therapy dogs. This interdisciplinary program drew expertise from veterinary mental health professionals, psychologists, animal-assisted therapists, and veterinary school faculty. This collaborative effort ensured that the program covered both the biomedical and humanistic aspects of veterinary medicine, preparing students to better understand and support their own and their peers' mental well-being. The AAE-MH program was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, and appropriate precautionary measures were taken. This teaching tip outlines the key elements of the program, including the course design, delivery, and evaluation of its effectiveness. We hope that this framework can provide fellow educators with the opportunity to potentially adapt and implement similar initiatives within their own veterinary education contexts, ultimately benefiting the entire veterinary profession.

TI  - A Mixed Methods Approach to Korean-Youth Mental Health First Aid (K-YMHFA): A Pilot Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF EVIDENCE-BASED SOCIAL WORK
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeKorean immigrant families are growing in the Southern United States (U.S), an area where culturally specific resources can be limited. Korean immigrant families encounter distress in navigating the American culture, but cultural stigma impedes discussion within the family. An evidence-based mental health awareness program called Youth Mental Health First Aid (YMHFA) exists to serve as gatekeeper training for lay adults to identify and support youth experiencing mental health challenges. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of a culturally adapted Korean-YMHFA (K-YMHFA) program among Korean immigrants in the Southern U.S.Materials and methodUsing a mixed methods approach, a quantitative survey was distributed before and after program completion (N = 24), and a follow-up interview following program completion was also completed (N = 12). Quantitative analysis conducted a paired sample t-test, qualitative analysis conducted directed content analysis, and mixed methods analysis developed joint displays.ResultsParticipant's mental health literacy, confidence and control in YMHFA skills, and positive attitude toward YMHFA skills significantly increased, and stigma decreased after the training. Participants also provided information on specific steps for increasing cultural relevancy and sustainability within the community. Overall, mixed methods analysis indicated that the program was feasible in the context of Korean immigrants in the Southern U.S.ConclusionDespite the growing Korean community, the Southern U.S. has limited Korean ethnic services. With the feasibility of K-YMHFA, advocacy in promoting K-YMHFA is needed to counteract the limited resources while serving as an early intervention for youth and families in distress.

TI  - Evaluation of a web-based information platform on youth depression and mental health in parents of adolescents with a history of depression
T2  - CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY AND MENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Research shows the important role of parents' mental health literacy in detecting depressive symptoms and supporting their children to seek professional help. Improving mental health literacy in parents has recently gained even greater importance due to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children and adolescents' mental health. The aim of the present experimental pre-post-follow-up study was to examine knowledge change after the reception of contents from an innovative web-based platform (www.ich-bin-alles.de/eltern) containing evidence-based information on youth depression and mental health in parents of adolescents with a history of depression. A second aim was to assess evaluation of the layout and the acceptance of the platform. N = 33 parents of adolescents with a history of depression (either current or remitted depression) were presented different content domains of the website. Participants' knowledge about depression was assessed at pre- and post-intervention, and at a four week follow-up. Moreover, parents evaluated the acceptance and the layout of the website. The trial was preregistered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05335564). The results showed a significant increase in total knowledge from pre to post, which remained stable over the course of four weeks. Explorative analyses showed that sociodemographic variables did not influence the extent of knowledge gain. Acceptance rates were high and evaluations of the website's layout were positive. The findings show that the web-based information portal is a promising and appealing means to increase parental knowledge on youth depression. Low-threshold psychoeducational approaches like websites are particularly relevant in times of crisis and increased prevalence rates of depressive symptoms and disorders (ehealth). These results are an important basis for future studies as well as approaches that aim to impart knowledge about mental disorders like youth depression via web-based means. Furthermore, they bear implications for policy decisions concerning mental health education and campaigns.

T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL METHODS IN SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Issues of mental health among higher vocational education students have attracted growing concern, fueling the need for novel pedagogical approaches that can foster psychological resilience. This study details the design and implementation of an innovative Virtual Reality (VR) pedagogical framework for mental health courses in higher vocational education settings. The research addresses the limitations of conventional pedagogical approaches through the use of immersive VR technology to create experiential learning spaces that foster the development of psychological resilience. Through a mixed-methods research design, we created an extensive VR-based curriculum with four main modules: stress management simulation, social interaction training, problem-solving under pressure, and exercises on emotional regulation. A 12 week experiment was carried out with 200 higher vocational students, comparing the effects of the VR intervention group with a control group receiving conventional instruction. Quantitative results revealed significant improvements in psychological resilience scores (Cohen's d = 0.78, p < 0.001). Qualitative findings revealed significant improvements in student engagement, skill transfer to real-life situations, and self-efficacy in coping with psychological adversity. The virtual reality (VR) model showed greater educational efficacy in terms of knowledge retention, with a 23% improvement, as well as in practical skill application, which showed a 31% improvement compared to traditional learning methods. This study presents an empirically supported model for incorporating VR technology in mental health training, providing data-driven recommendations for its use in professional settings and opening the door for new approaches utilizing VR technology to enhance psychological resilience.

AB  - This study investigated perceptions of mental health literacy, mental health status, mental health welfare center, and mental health business of local students. Totally, 388 students visiting the mental health welfare center located in G city were enrolled for the study. Data were collected from October 1 to October 26, 2018 using structured questionnaires, and analyzed by applying the IBM SPSS 24.0 statistics program. The mental health status of subjects was found to be most severely stressed (31.4%). The mental health literacy score of the subjects was 40.99 points, and 45.9% of the respondents had never heard of mental health welfare center. Considering mental health business, 68.3% had never heard of mental health counseling, and the most common way to access information about mental health or mental illness was the internet (58.0%). In addition, 75.3% respondents answered that an increase in the government budget for management of mental health and illness was required. Taken together, our results indicate the necessity to strengthen continuous education, promotion for mental health improvement, and the development of a customized mental health promotion program suitable for the student's level, through involvement of the community mental health welfare center.

TI  - Psychometric properties of the Turkish version of the universal mental health literacy scale for adolescents
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC NURSING-NURSING CARE OF CHILDREN & FAMILIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: While enhancing mental health literacy is a critical component of preventive mental health, there is currently no mental health literacy instrument specific to adolescents in Turkey. This study aimed to adapt the universal mental health literacy scale for adolescents (UMHL-A) to Turkish and determine its validity and reliability. Methods: This methodological study utilized data collected from 268 adolescents aged 10 to 14 years, between April and June 2024. Data were obtained using a personal information form and the UMHL-A. The construct validity of the scale was evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis, and its reliability was assessed with internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Results: The scale consists of two parts: the Likert UMHL-A, a five-point scale to determine adolescents' attitudes, and the T/F UMHL-A, a true/false scale to measure their knowledge. In this study, it was shown that the Likert UMHL-A, which includes 8 items and two factors, namely help-seeking and stigma, and the T/F UMHL-A, which consists 9 items and two factors namely mental health knowledge and mental illness knowledge, had good fit indices. The Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient was 0.934 for the Likert UMHL-A, and 0.862 for the T/F UMHL-A. The item-total score correlation coefficients of the Likert UMHL-A ranged between 0.582 and 0.856, whereas those of the T/F UMHL-A varied between 0.483 and 0.804. Conclusion: The Turkish version of the UMHL-A is a valid and reliable tool for assessing adolescents' mental health literacy. Implications for practice: Health professionals can use this brief and easy-to-apply instrument in clinical practices or educational programs to identify and improve adolescents' mental health literacy.

T2  - Psychiatria Danubina
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adolescent mental health has become an increasingly urgent concern, particularly in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mental Health Literacy (MHL) is emerging as a critical construct to promote psychological well-being, reduce stigma, and encourage the early recognition of psychological distress.METHODS: This study presents baseline data from a school-based pilot initiative conducted in a secondary school in Southern Italy. The aim was to assess students' knowledge beliefs, and attitudes toward mental health prior to implementing targeted educational interventions. A total of 85 fifth-year students (mean age = 17.7 years) completed the Italian version of the Mental Health Literacy Questionnaire - short form (MHLq-short), administered anonymously via an online platform. Statistical analyses included descriptive measures and non-parametric tests to explore the association between MHL scores and familiarity with mental health problems.RESULTS: Students who reported knowing someone with mental health issues exhibited a trend toward higher mental health literacy scores. In contrast, those who reported no such exposure or expressed uncertainty demonstrated lower average ranks, possibly reflecting limited awareness or emotional disengagement.CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the potential role of personal experience in shaping mental health literacy and reinforce the need for structured, school-based interventions. To our knowledge, this study represents the first application of the MHLq-short in Italy and supports its feasibility in identifying literacy gaps among adolescents. Future initiatives could aim to replicate and scale this model across diverse educational settings and inform national strategies to integrate MHL into school curricula.

AB  - This pilot study assessed the acceptability and feasibility of the PROviding ACcess To InnoVative & EvidenceBased Intervention (PROACTIVE) Family Navigator Program for foster parents of children with mental health needs. Foster parents (n = 7) participated in four video conference sessions with a family navigator over the course of one month. In this study, family navigators were psychology doctoral students with mental health training. Feasibility and acceptability were measured with post-session surveys completed by family navigators and participants as well as a participant-completed survey following completion of the program. Feasibility and acceptability were both found to be excellent. Foster parents provided very positive satisfaction ratings for all aspects of the program. This pilot study provided preliminary support for the feasibility and acceptability of the PROACTIVE Family Navigator Program. With the experienced gained in this pilot work, we will design a randomized controlled trial with a fully powered sample to evaluate the efficacy of this program on building foster parent capacity to manage their child's mental health needs.

TI  - MAternal Mental Health in the WORKplace (MAMH@WORK): A Protocol for Promoting Perinatal Maternal Mental Health and Wellbeing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Women are exposed to increased burden of mental disorders during the perinatal period: 13-19% experience postpartum depression. Perinatal psychological suffering affects early mother-child relationship, impacting child's emotional and cognitive development. Return-to-work brings additional vulnerability given the required balance between parenting and job demands. The MAternal Mental Health in the WORKplace (MAMH@WORK) project aims to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a brief and sustainable intervention, promoting (a) maternal mental health throughout pregnancy and first 12 months after delivery, and (b) quality of mother-child interactions, child emotional self-regulation, and cognitive self-control, while (c) reducing perinatal absenteeism and presenteeism. MAMH@WORK is a three-arm randomized controlled trial. A short-term cognitive-behavioral therapy-based (CBT-based) psychoeducation plus biofeedback intervention will be implemented by psychiatrists and psychologists, following a standardized procedure manual developed after consensus (Delphi method). Participants (n = 225, primiparous, singleton pregnant women at 28-30 weeks gestational age, aged 18-40 years, employed) will be randomly allocated to arms: CBT-based psychoeducation intervention (including mindfulness); psychoeducation plus biofeedback intervention; and control. Assessments will take place before and after delivery. Main outcomes (and main tools): mental health literacy (MHLS), psychological wellbeing (HADS, EPDS, KBS, CD-RISC, BRIEF COPE), quality of mother-child interaction, child-mother attachment, child emotional self-regulation and cognitive self-control (including PBQ, Strange Situation Procedure, QDIBRB, SGS-II, CARE-Index), job engagement (UWES), and presenteeism. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses will be conducted; Cohen's d coefficient, Cramer's V and odds ratio will be used to assess the effect size of the intervention. MAMH@WORK is expected to contribute to mental health promotion during the perinatal period and beyond. Its results have the potential to inform health policies regarding work-life balance and maternal mental health and wellbeing promotion in the workplace.

TI  - Mental health literacy of school-going adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa: a regional systematic review protocol
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction Assessing mental health literacy has implications for the identification and treatment of mental health problems. Adolescents have been identified as a particularly important target group for initiating and improving mental health literacy. However, much of what we know about adolescent mental health literacy comes from high-income countries. This proposed review seeks to synthesise the available published primary evidence from sub-Saharan Africa on the status and measurement of mental health literacy among school-going adolescents. Methods and analysis We will perform a systematic review reported in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement (PRISMA-2020). We will systematically search selected global databases (EMBASE, PsycINFO, PubMed and MEDLINE) and regional electronic databases (African Index Medicus and African Journals OnLine) up to December 2021 for observational and qualitative studies published in English and French. The standard quality assessment criteria for evaluating primary research papers from a variety of fields (QualSyst criteria) will be used to appraise the methodological quality of the included studies. The Petticrew-Roberts 3-step approach to narrative synthesis will be applied to the included studies. Ethics and dissemination We will not seek ethical approval from an institutional review board, as this is a systematic review of available and accessible literature. When completed, the full report of this review will be submitted to a journal for peer-reviewed publication; the key findings will be presented at local and international conferences with-partial or full-focus on (adolescent) mental health (literacy). PROSPERO registration number CRD42021229011.

AB  - Introduction: There is a need to change the culture within the art of dance, as it has been associated with injuries and mental health consequences. This study evaluates an intervention designed to increase mental health literacy, enhance nutritional knowledge, reduce symptoms and effects of low energy availability, and strengthen understanding of sports nutrition and recovery strategies, in dance students of mixed genders.Material and methods: A total of 125 dance students received three workshops, with 39 arts and crafts students serving as references. The results were evaluated by the Eating Disorder Examination questionnaire, the Low Energy Availability in Females questionnaire, the Hopkins Symptom Check List, and questions on mental health literacy, sports nutrition, and recovery knowledge.Results: Dance students achieved sustained improvements in mental health and nutrition knowledge and temporary improvements in driven exercise (i.e., performing exercise because of a compulsive drive).

TI  - Prevention of mental health issues in the young: A randomised controlled evaluation of an e-mental health application for young adults to enhance mental health literacy
T2  - INTERNET INTERVENTIONS-THE APPLICATION OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN MENTAL AND BEHAVIOURAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The mental health of young adults is deteriorating. Reasons for this are manifold, ranging from biological factors (e.g. entering a vulnerable developmental phase) to crisis-related external events (e.g. COVID19 pandemic). Accordingly, easily accessible and universal prevention for the young is needed. Mobile Health (mHealth) interventions are on the rise and especially promising for this age group, due to numerous benefits, such as low threshold, temporal and local flexibility and high scalability. However, the effectiveness and acceptance of mHealth interventions as prevention measures are missing empirical evidence. Method: In a two-arm randomised controlled trial design, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a mental health app, the 'Mental Health Guide', primarily on mental health literacy as well as secondary mental health outcomes. N = 322 Participants (81.99 % female, M = 25.55 years, SD = 9.63 years, age range: 15 to 59 years) were either assigned to the intervention group (n = 158), using the Mental Health Guide for 12 weeks, or the wait-list control group (n = 164). Results: The results show a significant intervention effect on mental health literacy for the intervention group in the post assessment (p = .047, d = 0.20), but no at later follow-up time points. Further variables related to mental health indicate various effects, such as improved problematic (p = .018, d = 0.20) and prosocial behaviour (p = .008, d = 0.23) in the intervention group and improved emotion regulation capacities for both groups (p < .001, d = 0.20). Overall, there was a high drop-out rate in the study (up to 80 %), especially in the intervention group. Conclusion: This study contributes valuable insights into the potential effectiveness of mHealth prevention in young adults and gives insights on how such applications are used under very naturalistic settings, laying a foundation for future research in this field. However, generalisability is limited due to selective sample characteristics and a rather high drop-out rate over time.

TI  - A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial of the Family Assessment and Feedback Intervention (FAFI): Effects on Mental Health Literacy and Attitudinal Engagement with Health Supports and Services
T2  - CHILD PSYCHIATRY & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This randomized controlled trial tested the Family Assessment and Feedback Intervention (FAFI), a new intervention to enhance family engagement with emotional and behavioral health services. The FAFI is a guided conversation with families about results of their multidimensional assessment that is set in the context of motivational enhancement. It differs from other assessment-with-feedback interventions by extending the focus of assessment beyond the target child to parents and the family environment, addressing parental emotional and behavioral problems and competencies, spanning a broad range of children's and parents' strengths and difficulties, and being generalizable to many settings and practitioners. Participants were 81 families in primary care pediatrics. The FAFI was associated with a significant increase in parental mental health literacy and with an increase in parental attitudinal engagement with health supports and services that closely approached statistical significance (p = .052), while controlling for children's age and gender and family socioeconomic status.

TI  - Assessing the Feasibility of a Peer Education Project to Improve Mental Health Literacy in Adolescents in the UK
T2  - COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Many mental health problems begin in adolescence and occur on a spectrum of severity: early recognition and intervention is important. This study is a quantitative feasibility study of the Mental Health Foundation's Peer Education Project (PEP). Attrition, psychometric properties of questionnaires, indications of improvement on a range of outcomes, and sample size required for a powered trial of effectiveness were assessed. 203 students completed the survey both pre and post-intervention. It was found that existing previously-validated measures had good psychometric properties, with two new questionnaires demonstrating reasonable reliability (self-help confidence alpha = 0.78, mental health knowledge alpha = 0.59). There were indications of improvement in help-seeking intentions, the number of sources likely to seek help from, and mental health knowledge from pre- to post-intervention. A future trial of PEP with a sample of approximately 36 schools, researcher-led data collections, and help-seeking intentions or sources as a primary outcome appears to be feasible.

TI  - Development and psychometric properties of the Knowledge and Attitudes to Mental Health Scales (KAMHS): a psychometric measure of mental health literacy in children and adolescents
T2  - BMC PEDIATRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Adolescence is a crucial period for the acquisition of good mental health behaviours, which are the foundation for health and wellbeing in later life. Improved knowledge about mental health and improved help-seeking behaviours have been shown to lead to better mental health outcomes. Mental health literacy (MHL) is multifaceted (e.g., knowledge about symptoms, the stigma around mental health, good mental health practices, etc.). Measures are needed that can assess these different aspects of MHL. Measurement of mental health literacy is currently limited due to a lack of reported psychometric instruments with known psychometric properties. Given that most mental health problems start in early adolescence, a scale is needed that is reliable and valid in this age group. Methods The development and validation of the psychometric instrument (termed the Knowledge and Attitudes to Mental Health Scales: KAMHS) entailed two phases: 1) item generation based on an evidence-based intervention programme: The Guide; and 2) item reduction through exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) for factor structure and psychometric assessment. Participants were 559 Year 9 pupils in secondary schools across Wales aged between 13 and 14 years. Results Results from the CFA indicated an acceptable fit of the model to the data. The KAMHS showed good internal constancy and moderate test-retest validity (.40-.64). Conclusions The final version of the KAMHS contains 50 items that are appropriate for use in children and adolescents. These results suggest that the KAMHS can be used over time to assess the efficacy of interventions aimed at increasing the mental health literacy of adolescent populations.

TI  - Healthy Minds: A School-Based Prevention Programme for Deliberate Self-harm in Adolescence
T2  - SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, there has been a notable increase in the prevalence of deliberate self-harm (DSH) among adolescents, which has led to the recognition of this issue as a significant public health challenge. However, school-based prevention programmes for DSH remain scarce. This study aimed to develop, implement, and evaluate the effectiveness of the Healthy Minds programme, a universal school-based prevention intervention targeting DSH in adolescents. Conducted in a Lisbon school, the programme sought to reduce DSH and suicidal ideation, change beliefs about DSH, and promote help-seeking. A quasi-experimental design with experimental and control groups included 137 participants aged 13-19 (M = 14.73; SD = 1.03), assessed at three time points: pre-intervention, post-intervention, and follow-up. The intervention showed partial effectiveness, with delayed reductions in DSH and significant improvements in reducing false beliefs. In addition, both groups showed increased help-seeking behaviours, and these effects were sustained over the follow-up period, suggesting long-term effectiveness. However, no significant improvements were observed in the ability to recognise warning signs of DSH, nor were there reductions in levels of suicidal ideation. The Healthy Minds programme shows promise in reducing DSH, improving mental health literacy and promoting help-seeking behaviours in adolescents, with sustained benefits observed over time. These findings highlight the importance of implementing well-structured, methodologically robust school-based interventions aimed at preventing DSH in this population. To maximise programme effectiveness, longer follow-up periods and more integrated, multifaceted approaches are essential.

T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although mental health concerns are common among children and adolescents, youth-serving adults often feel underprepared in responding to these challenges. Youth Mental Health First Aid (YMHFA) is a training program designed to teach adults how to assist youths experiencing mental health or addiction challenges. This pilot program evaluation study examined the outcomes of YMHFA associated with adult knowledge, confidence, beliefs, and behaviors. Participants included 2,180 individuals in Ohio who attended a YMHFA training between January 2015 and August 2016; most participants were White women and represented professions in the field of education. Results revealed that YMHFA participants became more confident, willing to help, aware of support and resources, and accepting of individuals with mental health conditions three months posttraining. A high percentage of YMHFA participants also reported applying YMHFA Action Steps at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the training. Demographic differences (by race, gender, age, and occupation) in the adult outcomes associated with YMHFA training did not emerge when removing the effects of other participant variables. Limitations, future directions for research, and implications for school psychology practice are discussed in this Service Delivery Brief.

TI  - Developmentally appropriate mental health literacy content for school-aged children and adolescents
T2  - CAMBRIDGE PRISMS-GLOBAL MENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Although improving the mental health of children and adolescents has become a global priority, resources outlining developmentally appropriate content for improving mental health literacy (MHL) across school-aged children are scarce. A comprehensive, life-course approach to building MHL is needed to address the evolving competencies, needs, capacities, and risk factors for mental health, especially to establish school-based interventions that can be equitably and sustainably implemented. We conducted a theoretical review highlighting the relation of research and practice in building MHL through developmentally appropriate knowledge and competencies for children and adolescents. A two-pronged review of the literature was conducted to provide an overview of (1) research with a focus on neurobiological, psychological, cognitive, and social developmental milestones of school-aged children relevant for building MHL and (2) evidence-based and theory-driven content for the development of universal MHL interventions for children and adolescents considering the four components of MHL. A map of relevant key milestones highlights the range of development that occurs and ample opportunity for increasing universal MHL during these sensitive years primed for learning. We reflect on current understandings and global considerations for MHL interventions with an emphasis on applying developmental science to the future strengthening of intervention development, uptake, adaptation, implementation, evaluation, and scale-up.

TI  - Education on the Social Determinants of Mental Health in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Fellowships
T2  - ACADEMIC PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective This article describes survey results from child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) fellowship program directors regarding attitudes of their programs' capacity to effectively educate fellows on the social determinants of mental health and program directors' perceived importance of doing so. Methods A survey asking about six topics within the social determinants of mental health was disseminated to all CAP program directors with email addresses found in the Fellowship and Residency Electronic Interactive Database (FREIDA) (n= 134). Data were exported using the Qualtrics survey platform. Results Fifty-three program directors (40%) responded to the survey. Overall, 98% of program directors felt education on the social determinants of mental health was "essential" for fellowship training, but there were significant differences in perceived relative importance and effectiveness of education provided across topics. Familial factors were rated as significantly more important than structural, historical, and economic factors. Structural and historical factors were viewed as being taught less effectively than other factors. Educational, structural, and historical factors and neighborhood factors were allotted significantly less instructional time than familial factors. Conclusions While there is near-universal consensus that social determinants of mental health education are critical for fellowship training, program directors feel that social determinants of mental health topics differ in importance and are taught at varying levels of effectiveness. These findings highlight the need for intra-institutional and or inter-institutional collaboration for social determinants of mental health educational content development if CAP programs are to prepare trainees to best serve their most vulnerable patients.

TI  - Promoting Mental Health Literacy of 13-16-Year-Old Students: A Systematic Review.
T2  - International journal of environmental research and public health
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Systematic Review
M3  - Review
AB  - PURPOSE: The global rise in mental health challenges among adolescents has led to the development of targeted interventions, including those designed to promote young people's understanding and awareness of mental health. This systematic review aims to identify and evaluate interventions implemented among secondary school students with the goal of enhancing mental health literacy, and to assess their effectiveness in achieving this outcome.METHODS: This review was partially aligned with the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Studies were retrieved from four electronic databases-CINAHL Complete, PubMed, Academic Search Elite, and ERIC-and supplemented by a limited number of relevant studies identified outside the systematic search. The analysis focused on the content, delivery, design, evaluation methods, and outcomes of mental health literacy (MHL) interventions conducted in secondary schools internationally.RESULTS: A total of 16 articles met the inclusion criteria. The articles described a variety of different MHL interventions (n = 12). The findings indicate that school-based MHL interventions have a positive impact on students' knowledge and understanding of mental health, but stigma reduction demonstrated less consistent effects. Study population, country, intervention content, delivery, methods, outcome measures, sample sizes and participants' age range varied notably across the studies.CONCLUSIONS: Based on the evidence synthesized in this review, school-based MHL interventions appear to be effective and may serve as a valuable component in broader efforts to promote mental health in adolescence. These findings reinforce existing evidence and provide a foundation for practical implications, but future research is highly recommended for a more solid base of evidence.

TI  - Assessing Mental Health Literacy Among Undergraduate Nursing Students in South Africa
T2  - NURSING REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Amidst a growing shortage of human resources for mental health, concerns persist over the mental health literacy (MHL) and readiness of nursing students to fulfil their future role as non-specialist mental healthcare providers. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the MHL among nursing students enrolled in a four-year nursing programme using the Mental Health Literacy Scale (MHLS) adapted and validated for primary health care workers in the South African context. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine the factors influencing MHL among the nursing students. Results: Only a third of the 220 respondents (n = 73; 33.2%) expressed interest in specialising in mental health. A one-way ANOVA revealed statistically significant differences in the MHLS scores across year levels, F(3, 216) = 3.225, p = 0.023, though Tukey post hoc analysis found no significant difference between second-year students (with mental health theory only) and third-/fourth-years (with both theoretical and clinical exposure, p = 0.295). Year of study, family history of mental illness, and career aspirations in mental health were significant predictors of MHL. While gender initially appeared significant, a sensitivity analysis suggested that this result may not be robust due to the small number of male participants. Conclusions: The absence of a significant difference in MHL among nursing students across years of study suggests limitations in how the nursing training programme integrates mental health theory with clinical practice. Nursing education stakeholders should review curricula and teaching strategies to ensure that MHL is effectively reinforced throughout training.

TI  - The impact of mental health literacy initiatives on youth elite athletes: A systematic review
T2  - PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENT & HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Several evidence-based programs to improve mental health literacy (MHL) are available; however, few have been adapted for youth athletes and sport-club settings. This systematic review aimed to investigate the impact of MHL initiatives, inclusive of education, resources and information, on the mental health of youth elite athletes. Studies were included if they examined a mental health program for young athletes (10-24 years) and reported MHL outcomes in either young people or their extended support network. A systematic search of the PubMed, Scopus and SPORTDiscus databases was conducted with no language or publication restrictions from July 2020 until September 2020. Thirteen studies were included for analysis in the review. Six studies included adolescent athletes, four studies included parents of adolescent athletes, six studies included coaching staff and three studies included female athletic populations. Five of these studies were qualitative and eight quantitative. The broad study search identified a lack of well designed, intervention-based research on MHL programs for youth elite athletes despite high demand for context specific programs. No literature that met eligibility criteria addressed MHL in youth female elite athletes exclusively. These findings limit dissemination and program transferability. This study also reinforces the influence parents and coaches have on the mental wellbeing of young elite athletes. To enhance the quality of MHL initiatives, programs developers should focus on the development of tailored resources for youth athletes with a gendered focus and incorporating opportunities for coach and parent engagement.

TI  - Australian paramedic students' mental health literacy and attitudes towards mental health
T2  - JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH TRAINING EDUCATION AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Australian paramedics regularly encounter patients experiencing mental illness. However, some paramedics hold negative attitudes towards the use of emergency services in providing care for these patients. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to examine the mental health literacy (MHL) of Australian paramedic students, and the training and experiential factors associated with MHL. Design/methodology/approach A cross-sectional online survey was delivered to paramedic students across Australia. A total of 94 paramedic students completed the survey examining MHL, mental health first aid (MHFA) intentions, confidence in providing help, personal and perceived stigma and willingness to interact with a person experiencing mental illness. Findings Participants generally had poor MHFA intentions in spite of good recognition of mental health disorders and good knowledge about mental health. Participants also demonstrated low stigmatising attitudes towards mental illness; however, they expressed a lack of willingness to interact with a person experiencing mental illness. Originality/value Our findings propose a combination of work-based experience and specific MHFA training may be beneficial to paramedic students to improve care for patients experiencing mental illness.

TI  - 'We do not talk about it': Engaging youth in Malawi to inform adaptation of a mental health literacy intervention
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeThere is limited knowledge on how to tackle mental health problems among youth in Africa. Literature describing community engagement (CE) approaches in low/middle-income countries (LMICs) health research is sparse. CE with youth from LMICS can help steer and shape culturally relevant interventions for stigmatised topics like mental health, resulting in better healthcare experiences. We share our experience of engaging youth in Malawi through advocacy organisations to inform cultural adaptation of a mental health literacy intervention. MethodsYoung people were recruited using social media from universities and community youth organisations in Malawi to participate in focus group discussions to help culturally adapt content of an existing mental health literacy intervention. Nine online focus groups with 44 individuals were conducted. Discussions involved views and experiences of mental health, including impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Discussions were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using content analysis. ResultsTranscript analyses revealed a vicious cycle of poverty and mental health problems for youth in Malawi. Four key themes were identified, 1) poverty-related socioeconomic and health challenges, 2) no one talks about mental health, 3) lacking mental health support and 4) relationship issues. These themes fed into one another within this vicious cycle which perpetually and negatively impacted their lives. The coronavirus pandemic worsened socioeconomic issues, health challenges, mental health and substance use issues, and burden on Malawi's already weak mental health system. ConclusionFindings suggest increasing untreated mental health burden among Malawi's youth. It highlights great need to address mental health literacy using existing community structures like educational settings to minimise burden on a weak health system. Online focus groups are an effective way of acquiring views from various young people in Malawi on mental health. This CE approach has grown our stakeholder network, strengthening potential for future CE activities and broader research dissemination.

TI  - Increasing Mental Health Literacy in Law Enforcement to Improve Best Practices in Policing-Introduction of an Empirically Derived, Modular, Differentiated, and End-User Driven Training Design
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Law enforcement officers often have contact to persons who show symptoms of mental disorders. Adequately designed training is necessary for developing the best possible practices in policing when coming into contact with mentally ill people, and may help to expand their general knowledge on mental disorders. To achieve a sustainable implementation of training content in daily policing work, the acceptance and proactive integration of methods by the training participants is essential.Method: This study investigates an exemplary modular training curriculum based on a survey with 2,228 German police officers (28.2% female, 71.8% male) concerning their needs and challenges when coming into contact with persons with mental disorders. This empirical end-user driven approach was used to adapt existing training concepts to the current needs and interests of law enforcement personnel in order to maximize compliance.Results: The training program draft includes basic modules which are intended to be of direct interest to all police officers, such as mental disorders with high policing relevance, encountering suicidal patients, (non-directive) communication and de-escalation skills, and mental hygiene in policing. They are arranged in more specialized modules that address specific target group audiences within police forces and the training curriculum provides information about genuine risks and self-protection, trauma sensitivity, and interaction with children and victims among other contents. The self-selectable, modular, and empirically-based continued training program also includes an introduction to local mental health service professionals and networks, trialogue sequences, and situational role play scenarios.Conclusion: Due to frequent contact law enforcement officers have to mentally ill people, improved training designed to maximize knowledge and the integration of trained methods is necessary. Gaining acceptance and proactive support by trainees is ensured through end-user driven implementation of specialized and differentiated up-to-date training programs. Our results showcase how police officers' perspectives on persons with mental illnesses is a main aspect that can and should be used to encourage training course designs.

TI  - Integrating a Strategic Framework to Improve Health Education in Schools in South Tyrol, Italy
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This narrative review addresses the integration of health education into school curricula in South Tyrol, an Italian province with significant cultural and linguistic diversity. This review's objective is to analyze current health education initiatives and propose a strategic framework to enhance school-based health education, aiming to improve student well-being post-pandemic. The review synthesizes global examples and recent local studies, highlighting the importance of comprehensive teacher training, mindfulness-based interventions, culturally sensitive health education, and community engagement. The key findings indicate that current health education programs in South Tyrol are insufficient to meet immediate public health needs, such as low vaccine uptake and mental health challenges exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The proposed strategic framework seeks to align educational strategies with the diverse needs of South Tyrol's student population, thereby improving health literacy and behavior and strengthening the region's public health infrastructure.

AB  - Aim: This study aimed to assess pediatricians' knowledge and awareness levels on mental health literacy (MHL) and investigate the factors affecting this level.Material and Methods: This study was designed as a cross-sectional self-report questionnaire-based internet study conducted on 01 February-25 February 2021. The population of the study consisted of pediatricians. The data were collected using questionnaires sent to volunteer physicians' smartphones. Participants filled in the sociodemographic data and the MHL Scale.Results: The data of 140 participants were analyzed in the study. The participants' mean age was 37.7 years, and 62.1% were females, 73.6% were married, and 75.0% were working as specialists. Considering index scores, 15% of the participants were observed to have insufficient MHL. Participation in training on child psychiatry (OR:7.5) predicted excellent MHL, while increased years of professional experience were observed to the predictor of insufficient MHL (OR:0.9 per year).Discussion: This study has investigated the knowledge levels and beliefs of pediatricians about mental health disorders and the important part of pediatricians have been observed to have insufficient MHL. The results have shown that organizing training and meetings in specialty training and intermittently afterward to improve MHL will be beneficial for pediatricians in recognizing and managing groups with mental illness.

TI  - Sources of stress and coping strategies among Chinese medical graduate students: a qualitative study
T2  - BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe incidence of mental health problems among medical graduate students is much higher than among students of other disciplines. This can have adverse consequences for the medical students themselves as well as their future patients. This study aims to understand the pressures faced by Chinese medical students and the current status of mental health education. It also propose recommendations for the current situation and prospects for the future.MethodThe authors conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with 22 master's students from five medical schools during November 2023. All interview sessions were recorded and transcribed verbatim. The transcriptions were analyzed using the Colaizzi's seven-step method.ResultThree main themes were extracted from the students' statements: sources of psychological stress, ways to cope with stress, and perspectives on mental health education. The study showed that current mental health education in China is mostly in the form of printed mental health education manuals and mental health lectures, and there is no active tiered intervention for students at different levels. It is suggested that reforms should be made to shift to a model where the school proactively identifies problems and intervenes based on feedback.ConclusionThis study reveals the widespread psychological stress and shortcomings in current education methods. To address these challenges, institutions should develop tailored interventions, including tiered support systems, open dialogue promotion, and resilience training. Future research should focus on evaluating innovative interventions' effectiveness, ultimately fostering a supportive environment that enhances students' success and contributes to a healthier healthcare workforce.

TI  - Perceptions of mental health literacy, stigma, empathy, and confidence in managing patients with psychiatric disorders among doctors and nurses working in a Singapore emergency department
T2  - BMC EMERGENCY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - In line with the global rise in mental health disorders, Singapore has experienced a notable increase in prevalence, from 13.4% in 2020 to 17% in 2022. Despite strategic efforts to strengthen mental health services, such as expanding the workforce of psychiatrists and psychologists and integrating care into primary healthcare settings, the Emergency Department (ED) faces escalating numbers of patients with psychiatric disorders. This surge leads to heightened workloads, stress, and burnout among healthcare professionals. This study explores the perceptions of mental health literacy, stigma, empathy, and confidence in managing patients with psychiatric disorders among doctors and nurses working in Singapore's EDs. Questionnaires used include the Mental Health Literacy Scale (MHLS) to assess mental health literacy, the Opening Minds Scale for Health Care Providers-15 (OMS-HC-15) to measure attitudes toward mental illness, and the Jefferson Scale of Empathy (JSE) to measure empathy. In the last quarter of 2021, 47 doctors and 63 nurses from the ED at a general restructured hospital in Singapore, who had worked for at least 4 months in the ED, completed the survey. The anonymous survey included the above-validated questionnaires and two original questionnaires that assessed confidence in managing patients with psychiatric disorders and their familiarity with the local Mental Health Care and Treatment Act (MHCTA). Differences between doctors and nurses for all categorical variables, including demographic data and the questionnaire responses of interest, were analysed. Findings reveal that doctors scored higher in mental health literacy (MHLS score of 121.89 to 118.27) and empathy (JSE score of 109.32 to 101.44) and lower in stigma than nurses (OMS-HC-15 score of 41.98 to 43.57). Furthermore, Singaporean ED professionals scored lower on these dimensions than their counterparts in Western countries but outperformed those in East Asia. The unique roles of doctors and nurses, coupled with Singapore's distinct sociocultural context, likely contribute to these variations. Both groups demonstrated moderate confidence in handling patients with psychiatric disorders but emphasised the need for further training. These insights underscore the importance of implementing systemic policies and targeted training programmes to improve mental health care, reduce stigma, and enhance empathy and confidence among ED professionals.

TI  - Adolescent Mental Health Literacy Questionnaire: Investigating Psychometric Properties in Iranian Female Students
T2  - BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives. Mental Health Literacy (MHL) is an important factor in promoting mental health. Assessing this structure is required for early recognition and intervention in mental health problems. To date, there was no tool to assess it among Iranian adolescents, so this study was aimed at examining the psychometric properties of the Persian version of the Adolescent Mental Health Literacy Questionnaire (AMHLQ) among Iranian female students. Method. The study instrument was a Persian version of the AMHLQ prepared through a translation and back-translation process. In this cross-sectional study, 275 female students completed the AMHLQ, and the Adolescent Strengths, and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Results. Findings of content, construct validity tests, Cronbach's alpha, and split-half coefficient demonstrated that the AMHLQ had satisfactory validity and suitable reliability. The exploratory factor analysis showed four dimensions of the AMHLQ: (1) knowledge of mental health problems (alpha=0.89); (2) erroneous beliefs/stereotypes (alpha=0.89); (3) help-seeking and first aid skills (alpha=0.86); and (4) self-help strategies (alpha=0.74). Conclusion. The findings showed that the tool was confirmed by questions and subscales, and this questionnaire was a valid and reliable tool in assessing level differences of MHL and in determining the impact of programs designed to improve MHL in Iranian female adolescents.

TI  - "This Is Me" an Awareness-Raising and Anti-Stigma Program for Undergraduate Nursing Students: A Pre-Post Intervention Study
T2  - NURSING REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Stigma education for nursing students has focused solely on stigma reduction, with studies showing temporary improvements in attitudes. However, nursing education research should also emphasize the importance of critical reflection and self-reflection to enhance attitudes, beliefs, topic comprehension, and learning satisfaction. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the "This is me" intervention regarding knowledge, attitudes, and communication skills of senior undergraduate nursing students in responding to mental illness-related stigma. Methods: This study employed a psychoeducational intervention for reducing mental illness stigma, using a questionnaire survey to assess pre- and post-intervention effects, with 37 eligible nursing students undergoing clinical training in psychiatric services between 16 May and 15 July 2022. Instruments included sociodemographic and health questions, the MICA-4 scale to evaluate students' attitudes toward mental illness, the MAKS to measure mental health knowledge, the Empathy Scale (JSPE-S), the Intergroup Anxiety Scale (SS-12), and the Attribution Questionnaire (AQ-27). Results: Most students were female (73.0%) and single (70.3%), with a mean age of around 29 years. After implementing the psychoeducational program, there was a statistically significant increase in overall stigma-related knowledge (MAKS: Z = -1.99, p < 0.05), a decrease in intergroup anxiety (IAS: Z = -3.42, p < 0.05), and reductions in the perceptions of patients as dangerous (AQ27-Dangerousness: Z = -2.399, p < 0.05) and fear (AQ27-Fear: Z = -2.415, p < 0.05). Additionally, there was an improvement in empathy, specifically in Perspective Taking (JSPE: Z = -2.555, p < 0.05). Conclusions: This program may contribute to mental health literacy related to stigma, positively impacting therapeutic relationships and communication with people with mental illness and resulting in more effective care practices.

M3  - Retracted Publication
AB  - A healthy psychological state is the premise for children to carry out various activities. Previous surveys have shown that children with special needs are affected by their own obstacles and are more prone to psychological problems such as sensitivity, low self-esteem, and impulsiveness. Therefore, it is necessary to provide more systematic mental health education support for special children. Mental health education programs are an efficient form of maintaining children's mental health. However, in the field of special education, the number of mental health education courses developed according to the physical and mental characteristics and developmental needs of special children is relatively small, and there are many difficulties in the implementation process. Autism disorder (ASD) is a kind of pervasive developmental dysfunction that is relatively common and representative in clinical practice. In recent years, the number of autistic children has continued to surge, and has gradually expanded from a family problem to a serious social problem. At present, the evaluation of the effect of autism intervention mainly relies on various behavioral scales, which are subjective to a certain extent. At the same time, due to the unclear pathogenesis of autism, the treatment of autism cannot be predicated on the right medicine, and can only be intervened in various ways. The purpose of this paper is to explore the difference between the EEG signals of autistic children and typically developing control (TD) children through the analysis method of EEG signals, and based on the analysis of EEG signals from an objective point of view, to study whether the music therapy method of Chinese Zither playing training can effectively Improving the brain functional status of children with autism yields positive therapeutic outcomes. The experimental results show that the complexity of brain electrical signals of ASD children is much lower than that of TD children, and there is a significant difference in the brain functional state between the two. The music therapy method based on Chinese zither playing training can improve the brain function of autistic patients, and there is a positive therapeutic effect. And with the extension of the training period, the effect may be more significant. Chinese zither playing training can provide a new direction for the intervention of autism.

TI  - The Role of Interpersonal Communication in Mental Health Literacy Interventions for Young People: A Theoretical Review
T2  - HEALTH COMMUNICATION
M3  - Review
AB  - School-based mental health literacy (MHL) programs can increase knowledge, reduce stigma, and encourage help-seeking behaviors in school-aged children. Yet, MHL intervention effects are inconsistent and unsustainable over time, and scholars have called for more theoretical work to address these limitations. The purpose of this theoretical review is to investigate how theory is utilized in MHL interventions, explore the interpersonal communication processes integrated in MHL interventions, and uncover the theoretical assumptions made in MHL interventions about interpersonal communication. We identified 27 articles for inclusion and utilized both content and interpretive analyses. Findings suggest that very few MHL interventions are based in theory; interpersonal communication is a central component within MHL programming; and numerous assumptions are made about interpersonal communication within MHL interventions that need to be addressed theoretically and empirically. Accordingly, we recommend that MHL intervention content and delivery practices are grounded in interpersonal communication theory related to disclosure and social support (seeking and provision). Additionally, teaching disclosure and social support skills may be a productive way for MHL interventions to help students build self-efficacy in communication about mental health for themselves and others.

TI  - Depression: [Mental] Health Literacy, Stigma, and Perceived Barriers to Help-Seeking During Transitions Among Undergraduate Nursing Students
T2  - NURSING REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Objectives: Mental health literacy (MHL) plays a crucial role in transitional processes, influencing, for example, students' adaptation to higher education and, later, their transition into the workforce. This study assesses MHL about depression among first- and fourth-year nursing students and identifies which MHL components and related variables are associated with a higher likelihood of being in either academic year. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive correlational study was conducted with 478 nursing students (59.4% first-year students; 40.6% fourth-year students), predominantly female (82.2%), with a mean age of 20.41 years (SD = 4.71) and a median age of 19.0 years. Results: The results revealed a low level of recognition of depression and knowledge of mental health first aid (MHFA) strategies, including health literacy. Students tended not to hold beliefs based on myths and stereotypes about mental illness and individuals with mental illness and did not have highly stigmatizing views. MHL varied by year of study, with fourth-year students having more adequate MHL levels. Conclusions: These findings highlight the need to integrate MHL as a key element of academic success. Health education initiatives that promote mental health, prevention, and MHFA training may serve as effective strategies to enhance MHL among nursing students.

M3  - Early Access
AB  - AimsThis study aims to identify factors associated with mental health literacy (mental health knowledge and attitudes towards mental health and help-seeking behaviours), depression and anxiety amongst adolescents, and test the hypothesised model by examining the interrelationships between these outcomes.DesignCross-sectional descriptive quantitative research.MethodsUsing convenient sampling, 615 adolescents from four public schools completed online questionnaires measuring mental health literacy, depression, and anxiety. The data were analysed using Pearson correlation, multiple linear regression, and structural equation modelling (SEM).ResultsIndividual factors (e.g., gender, physical health and past traumatic experiences), family factors (e.g., parental criticism and family support) and school/community factors (e.g., academic pressure and safety) were associated with mental health outcomes. SEM revealed an association between higher mental health knowledge and better attitudes towards mental health and help-seeking behaviours but did not show a significant association with depression and anxiety.ConclusionsFindings emphasise the need for holistic and culturally safe approaches to address adolescent mental health in Indonesia.ImplicationsFuture research should focus on developing and evaluating tailored mental health interventions in Indonesia that address individual, family, school, and community factors. These interventions should target the interrelated aspects of mental health literacy, depression, and anxiety identified in this study. Key areas for intervention include enhancing self-esteem, promoting help-seeking behaviours, supporting spirituality, managing long-term conditions, improving sleep hygiene, encouraging physical activity, teaching stress management techniques, fostering diversity, managing trauma, and combating discrimination. A comprehensive approach to adolescent mental well-being should integrate parental involvement, peer support systems, community engagement initiatives, and mental health literacy education.ImpactThis research informs future interventions such as school-based programs, family-oriented campaigns, and community initiatives to support adolescent mental health, potentially influencing policy decisions, and resource allocation in mental health services.Reporting MethodSTROBE guidelines.Patient or Public ContributionNo direct patient or public contribution.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT MENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Adolescent mental illness contributes significantly to both the global and South African burden of mental health. Mental health literacy (MHL) promotes early recognition and intervention and consequently, determines mental health-promoting behaviours. We aimed to explore adolescent MHL and its intersection with help-seeking behaviour and gender in adolescents in the Western Cape.Method: The study instrument was a self-report survey/questionnaire. One hundred learners from public and independent schools in the Western Cape completed the survey.Results: There was a significant difference between first aid skills and help-seeking behaviours between the different genders. Specifically, girls were more prone to first aid skills and help-seeking behaviours than boys and other genders. Boys, on the other hand, were significantly more prone to using self-help strategies than girls and other genders. While gender differences were evident, these results are not sufficient to generalise to the larger population due to the limited sample.Conclusion: The results of this study are relevant to practitioners who wish to improve MHL and help-seeking behaviours among adolescents.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ANXIETY DISORDERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Poor mental health literacy and greater alignment with norms of hegemonic masculinity are established barriers to mental health help-seeking in men. However, little is known about how these variables influence adolescent male help-seeking and in particular, help-seeking for anxiety disorders. This study investigated the relationship between i) anxiety mental health literacy, ii) alignment with traditional masculinity norms and iii) help-seeking attitudes, intentions and behaviour in a sample of adolescent males.Methods: 1732 adolescent males (aged 12-18 years) participated online whilst at school.Results: Participant attitudes towards formal help-seeking, intentions to seek help from a family member and from an online source were found to predict professional help-seeking behaviour by the adolescent and/or by their parents on the adolescents' behalf. In adolescents with a low or average personal alignment with norms of hegemonic masculinity, greater anxiety mental health literacy was positively associated with more favourable attitudes towards formal and informal help-seeking. However, this relationship was not found in adolescent males with a greater alignment with norms of hegemonic masculinity.Limitations: The study had a correlational research design and used self-report measures.Conclusions: Mental health initiatives which consider the impact of masculinity and gender stereotypes have the potential to significantly improve help-seeking in this population.

TI  - Meaning mindset theory: a transdiagnostic approach to mental health promotion and intervention for children
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - A transdiagnostic approach is increasingly recognized as crucial in the prevention or treatment of child internalizing and externalizing mental health concerns. There is substantial overlap and comorbidity among various mental health concerns and the onset of one mental illness elevates the risk of others, underscoring the potential limitations of singular-focused mental health education or treatment. Meaning Mindset Theory (MMT) is a transdiagnostic framework developed and evaluated over the past decade in Canada as a promising new approach. MMT emphasizes agency over thoughts and behaviors, empathy and social competence skills, and meaningful engagement to enhance resilience for both internalizing and externalizing symptoms. The DREAM Program-Developing Resilience through Emotions, Attitudes, and Meaning is a mental health education program grounded in MMT principles. This program has enhanced meaning mindset-agency over thoughts and behaviors, hope for a future that is good, positive self-concept, and openness to learning, new experiences, and feelings-as well as both internalizing and externalizing mental health. To date, the DREAM program, as well as MMT more broadly, has been tested in diverse populations with school-aged children, families, neurodiverse and intellectually gifted young people, homeless men, and Black families, among others. Future research should explore the efficacy of an MMT in therapeutic settings compared to standard treatments, potentially enhancing mental health intervention strategies for Canadian children and families.

M3  - Article
AB  - teen Mental Health First Aid (teenMHFA) is a school-based mental health program that trains adolescents to support peers who are experiencing mental health problems or crises. The program has been evaluated for adolescents aged 15-18 years as part of a randomized controlled trial, however qualitative feedback from students on their perceptions of the program is yet to be explored. The current study describes the perspectives of students who took part in the trial. Feedback on the perceived strengths and weaknesses of the program was provided by 979 Year 10 students (M = 15.82 years, female = 43.94%, English as a first language = 72.77%) at four government funded public schools in Melbourne, Australia via online surveys. A content and thematic analysis was performed on the data using a six-step process. Students generally found the program relevant and they connected with the visual material, personal stories and interactive activities. Suggestions for improvements included encouraging active student participation in classroom discussion and providing opportunities to practice skills. School-based mental health education can benefit from input from stakeholder perspectives, particularly when designing mental health content for delivery by external trainers.

T2  - ASEAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to verify the adolescents ability to correctly identify mental health disorders such as depression and the intention to seek help, which refers to the determinants of Mental Health Literacy (MHL). As well as understanding the relationship between MHL and the psychological state associated with depression among adolescents in schools. This study was conducted using a cross sectional descriptive design and included 450 adolescent students (215 males and 235 females) from public intermediate and secondary schools in southern Jordan, and they were between 13 and 16 years old from ten randomly selected schools. Data on sociodemographic characteristics (gender, age, smoking, exposure to bullying, loneliness, parental marital status, and financial status represented by parental income) of participating adolescents were collected through student data from school principals and then assessed by the Global Student Health Survey (GSHS). MHL among adolescents was assessed and measured using the depression vignette and questionnaire of the mental health literacy and stigma. The data were analyzed using the Statistical Program for Social Sciences (SPSS) and multivariate binary logistic regression to examine and study the determinants of MHL. The results were obtained, the most important of which was that the adequate levels of MHL among adolescents were clearly and directly related to several factors. This was demonstrated by the use of multivariate analysis. The study concluded that the factors that significantly affected adequate levels of MHL were gender (females), age (older adolescents), non-smoking, and lack of loneliness. Where the values related to these factors obtained from multivariate analysis were (AOR=1.72; 95% CI 1.15, 2.57), (AOR=1.52; 95% CI 1.04, 2.22), (AOR=1.60; 95% CI 1.09, 3.54), (AOR=1.20; 95% CI 1.12, 1.76), respectively. One of the most important recommendations focused in this research is to pay attention to addressing the determinants and levels of MHL adequate to develop a generation of young adolescents who are more aware and free of mental disorders and have high levels of MHL adequate.

TI  - Moderators of pre-post changes in school-based mental health promotion: Psychological stress symptom decrease for adolescents with mental health problems, knowledge increase for all
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSchool-based mental health promotion aims to strengthen mental health and reduce stress. Results on the effectiveness of such programs are heterogeneous. This study realized a school-based mental health promotion program (StresSOS) for all students and aimed to identify moderators (mental health status, gender, grade level) of pre- to post-changes in stress symptoms and knowledge. MethodsParticipants were N = 510 adolescents (from 29 classes; 46.7% female) aged 12-18 years (M = 13.88, SD = 1.00; grade levels 7-10). They were without mental health problems (65.9%), at risk for mental health problems (21.6%), or with mental health problems (12.5%) and participated in a 90 min per week face-to-face training with 8 sessions in class at school. Demographic variables, mental health status, stress symptoms, and knowledge about stress and mental health were collected at baseline. Program acceptance, stress symptoms, and knowledge were collected post-intervention. Multilevel mixed effects models were conducted with the fixed effects time (within factor), mental health status, gender, and grade level (between factors). Random effects for students within classes were included. ResultsIn the pre-post comparison, mental health status moderated the changes on psychological stress symptoms (p < 0.05). In adolescents with mental health problems the largest reduction in stress symptoms was observed between pre- and post-assessment. Gender and grade level were less relevant. For all adolescents knowledge gains were revealed (p < 0.001). Program acceptance was moderated by mental health status and grade level (p < 0.01). Mentally healthy adolescents and within the group of adolescents at-risk or with mental health problems, especially younger students (7(th)/8(th) grade), rated program acceptance higher. ConclusionPsychological stress symptoms decreased among adolescents with mental health problems and not among adolescents at risk for or without mental health problems. Mental health-related knowledge increased for all adolescents. The results add to knowledge on school-based mental health intervention research and practice. Its implications for different prevention strategies (universal, selective or a combination of both) are discussed.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF E-COLLABORATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of incorporating mental health education into ideological and political theory classrooms using speech emotion recognition technology from the field of human-computer interaction. Mental health education is essential for students' well-being, and this study establishes a theoretical framework for its integration into the curriculum. Utilizing recurrent neural networks (RNNs) augmented with attention mechanisms, the research demonstrates the model's proficiency in identifying subtle emotional cues within speech data. The model achieves an average recognition accuracy of 87.21% on the RAVDESS speech emotion corpus, showing particular strengths in detecting emotions like happiness and boredom. The findings suggest that this technology can be effectively employed to gauge student satisfaction with different teaching methodologies post-integration, offering valuable insights for refining educational practices in ideological and political theory classes through improved mental health education initiatives.

TI  - Basketball experience: Exploring Nigerian basketball coaches' perspectives of grassroots sport-for-development programming as a tool to enhance well-being
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPORTS SCIENCE & COACHING
M3  - Article
AB  - Considering the disparity between mental health services and resources available in Nigeria, researchers have highlighted the need for organizations, policymakers, and health service providers to revamp their approaches. Due to its unifying nature and cultural importance in the youth population, grassroots sport programming has been shown to be an effective mechanism in promoting education and life skills. In Lagos, Nigeria, the Basketball Experience program was designed to promote physical well-being, healthy living, mental health, and life skills in Nigerian youth utilizing principles from the Resilience and Youth Development Module. Researchers interviewed seven female and three male coaches using a phenomenological approach to investigate their perspectives of the program's impact on themselves and the youth they coach. Results suggest that implementing mental health education and resilience development, specifically through positive mentorship and strategies such as breathing and mindfulness exercises, into a sport for development program can assist with increased knowledge and reduced mental health stigma. Coaches strongly endorsed increased use of programs like Basketball Experience to promote positive development and combat the disparity in mental health literacy and policy, and they suggested that such programs have the power to help restructure the longstanding cycle of negative stressors inherent to life in Nigeria. Based on these perspectives, the authors discuss how grassroots sport programming can be an effective tool in the development of both coaches and youth. Moreover, the authors advocate for the Resilience and Youth Development Module as an impactful theoretical framework for facilitating resilience and life skills in coaches and youth.

TI  - Impacts of adolescent participation in a mental health education, leadership, and advocacy program (the Live4Life Crew) on outcomes after leaving secondary school in Victoria, Australia: A qualitative study
T2  - SSM-MENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: A key component of the Live4Life program, run by not-for-profit entity Youth Live4Life, is a 'Crew' of youth mental health ambassadors aged 14-16 years who undergo a mental health education, leadership, and advocacy program. Building on past evaluations, this study explores the impacts of Live4LifeCrew participation on their lives after leaving secondary school. Objective: This study describes the impacts of Crew participation on alumni's health, wellbeing, education, employment, and skill development after leaving secondary school, and to explore the drivers of these impacts. Methods: Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with Crew alumni (n = 16, 67 % female) in Victoria, Australia. Template analysis was used to analyse the data, using the Bronfenbrenner's Process-PersonContext-Time (PPCT) as an organising framework. Results: Crew participation enhanced interpersonal skills such as leadership, communication, public speaking, and empathy that alumni continued to use in their study, work, and relationships. Participants reported maintenance of key Mental Health First Aid skills, including knowledge of mental health problems and confidence to help others experiencing a mental health crisis. Their own help-seeking behaviours improved during and after Crew participation. Effective adult support was vital in shaping participant experiences; however, when such support did not consider the school or community context, it negatively impacted Crew members' experiences. Crew alumni characterised the Live4Life model as unique in a context with high stigma around mental health challenges and limited mental health education. Conclusions: Alumni described the Live4Life Crew program as an impactful and positive experience. Participants noted the importance of tailoring implementation to specific settings to further enhance the program's impact.

TI  - Mental health literacy questionnaire-short version for adults (MHLq-SVa): validation study in China, India, Indonesia, Portugal, Thailand, and the United States
T2  - BMC PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Mental Health Literacy (MHL) has become a focus of research in recent decades, as a prerequisite for early identification and intervention for mental health problems. Although several instruments have been developed for assessing MHL, there is a need for brief and psychometrically sound measures to capture important aspects of MHL in large and diverse adult samples. The present study aimed to: (1) provide a revised and shorter version of a previously validated questionnaire for assessing MHL; and (2) examine the psychometric properties of the MHLq-SVa in student samples from six different countries (China, India, Indonesia, Portugal, Thailand, and United States). Methods: The study involved 2180 senior school and undergraduate students, aged between 17 and 25 years old, from China, India, Indonesia, Portugal, Thailand, and the United States. Participants responded to the Mental Health Literacy Questionnaire for young adults (MHLq-ya), in their native language, following its translation and adaptation for each culture. The MHLq-ya comprises 29 items, organized into four dimensions: Knowledge of mental health problems; Erroneous beliefs/stereotypes; First-aid skills and help-seeking behavior; Self-help strategies. Confirmatory factor analyses and internal consistency analyses were performed on the combined data. Results: Data from the different countries supported a shorter version of the questionnaire (MHLq-SVa), composed of 16 items that fit with previously defined dimensions. Internal consistency and between-factor correlations further supported the adequacy of the instrument's psychometric properties. Conclusion: The study provided preliminary support for the construct validity and reliability of the MHLq-SVa as a measure for assessing MHL in young adults from six different countries and languages. Future studies are needed to further validate the measure and undertake multicultural comparisons of MHL in diverse samples from around the globe.

TI  - Understanding Family Experiences: A Study on Mental Health Literacy in Adolescent Eating Disorder Diagnoses
T2  - NURSING REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Adolescent eating disorders pose a significant public health challenge and strongly affect both physical and emotional well-being. Early diagnosis is important for improving treatment outcomes, though it remains complex due to multiple influencing factors. The family perspective is essential in this process, as it provides valuable insights into changes in adolescents' habits and emotional health. Methods: A descriptive qualitative study was conducted between January and February 2023. Interviews were conducted with 12 participants using a phenomenological approach to explore the experiences and perspectives of family members of adolescents with eating disorders. Results: Four thematic blocks comprising several categories were identified: (T1) diagnosis, (T2) family, (T3) resources, and (T4) treatment. The participants emphasized the need for early intervention and a multidisciplinary approach to the treatment of eating disorders. Family therapy was recognized as vital to treatment, and common dissatisfaction with the public health structure underscores the need for greater investment in research and access to specialists. Mental health nurse practitioners play an important role in providing comprehensive care and support, as well as mental health literacy. Conclusions: A holistic, patient-centered approach, including family involvement and appropriate support systems, is key to improving the outcomes and quality of life of adolescents undergoing treatment for eating disorders. Improving healthcare resources and addressing the challenges faced by families is essential. In addition, mental health literacy is critical, as it enables families to understand the disease better, make informed decisions, and actively participate in the recovery process, thus contributing to improved therapeutic outcomes and quality of life for patients.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mental health literacy (MHL) helps improve mental health outcomes and reduce the impacts of mental illness. This study aims to reflect on scientific evidence on MHL levels, barriers to MHL, their impacts on mental health among Australian youth and interventions to overcome these barriers. The factors explored in the Perspective included; influence of social determinants, culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) communities, help-seeking attitudes and behaviors. MHL intervention programs and MHL for improving mental health outcomes due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic were also explored. Adequate levels of youth MHL significantly improved one's ability to recognize own mental health status as well as provide peer support. Practical considerations such as designing more gender and culturally specific youth MHL programs are proposed.

TI  - The Peer Education Project to improve mental health literacy in secondary school students in England: a qualitative realist evaluation.
T2  - Lancet (London, England)
M3  - Randomized Controlled Trial
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Worsening of adolescent mental health and exacerbated health inequalities after the COVID-19 pandemic calls for universal preventative strategies. The Mental Health Foundation's school-based Peer Education Project seeks to improve students' mental health literacy through peer educators (aged 14-18 years) teaching peer learners (aged 11-13 years) to recognise good and bad mental health, identify risk and protective factors, and seek help accordingly. Although previous before and after quantitative assessments have found the intervention to be effective, this realist evaluation aimed to qualitatively develop the theory of change, exploring how the mechanisms played out in different contexts to achieve the desired outcomes.METHODS: Our initial programme theory was developed following expert stakeholder consultation and reviewing the literature. We divided mechanisms into resources and reasoning to explain how the intervention components (ie, resources), experienced within specific contexts, engendered responses in the participants (ie, reasoning), to produce observable outcomes. Data collected from six purposively recruited schools in England comprised staff interviews (n=11), student focus groups (n=15), and observations (n=5). Deductive and inductive analysis was undertaken, using NVivo-informed multiple causal statements represented as context-mechanism-outcome configurations (CMOcs), to test and refine the programme theory.FINDINGS: We created several distinct CMOcs. For example, in learners accustomed to didactic teaching methods (context), conversing with educators having similar life experience (mechanism resource) endorsed and destigmatised help-seeking behaviour (mechanism reasoning) and facilitated a realisation that seeking help was appropriate and acceptable (outcome). Other mechanisms included the following: learners perceiving the information as tailored and relevant, educators feeling empowered, and a cultural shift percolating across the school.INTERPRETATION: Our findings show how peer education can work to improve mental health literacy, which will inform changes to the intervention to maximise its effectiveness in different operational contexts. Future research could test our theory of change in a randomised controlled trial, and examine impacts on inequalities in a more diverse sample.FUNDING: National Institute for Health and Care Research School for Public Health Research.

TI  - The Effects of a Universal, School-Based Mental Health Literacy Program to Improve Resilience and Self-Efficacy Among 5-6th Grade Students From Three, Title 1 School in Rural Alabama: Advocates 4 All Youth
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY IN THE SCHOOLS
M3  - Article
AB  - Advocates 4 ALL Youth (ALLY) is a universal, 6-week mental health literacy program, implemented in schools during the school day by community volunteers. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of the ALLY program on youth who endorsed negative affect (i.e., self-reported symptoms of both depression and anxiety). Using a randomized controlled trial design, 5-6th grade students (11-13 years) attending three rural elementary schools in low-income and predominant African American communities were invited to participate. A total of 109 students (91% African American/Black) participated in the program (91% participation rate) and were randomized into treatment group-who received ALLY (n = 57) or control group (n = 52). All students completed a pre-post-assessment (baseline and post-program). A total of 58% youth in the treatment group endorsed negative affect at baseline and this was reduced to 53% post-program delivery (p < 0.01). No change in negative affect was reported in control group (44% pre and 44% post with self-reported negative affect). These results suggest that participants at greatest risk for mental health issues may benefit from ALLY.

Although previous before and after quantitative assessments have found the intervention to be effective, this realist evaluation aimed to qualitatively develop the theory of change, exploring how the mechanisms played out in different contexts to achieve the desired outcomes.METHODS: Our initial programme theory was developed following expert stakeholder consultation and reviewing the literature. We divided mechanisms into resources and reasoning to explain how the intervention components (ie, resources), experienced within specific contexts, engendered responses in the participants (ie, reasoning), to produce observable outcomes. Data collected from six purposively recruited schools in England comprised staff interviews (n=11), student focus groups (n=15), and observations (n=5). Deductive and inductive analysis was undertaken, using NVivo-informed multiple causal statements represented as context-mechanism-outcome configurations (CMOcs), to test and refine the programme theory.FINDINGS: We created several distinct CMOcs. For example, in learners accustomed to didactic teaching methods (context), conversing with educators having similar life experience (mechanism resource) endorsed and destigmatised help-seeking behaviour (mechanism reasoning) and facilitated a realisation that seeking help was appropriate and acceptable (outcome). Other mechanisms included the following: learners perceiving the information as tailored and relevant, educators feeling empowered, and a cultural shift percolating across the school.INTERPRETATION: Our findings show how peer education can work to improve mental health literacy, which will inform changes to the intervention to maximise its effectiveness in different operational contexts. Future research could test our theory of change in a randomised controlled trial, and examine impacts on inequalities in a more diverse sample.FUNDING: National Institute for Health and Care Research School for Public Health Research.

TI  - Nurses' perspective about the Mental Health First Aid Training Programmes for adolescents in upper secondary schools: A focus group study
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC AND MENTAL HEALTH NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accessible Summary What is known on the subject? Mental Health First Aid Training Programmes with a pathogenic perspective are implemented worldwide for different participants and contexts. These interventions can promote the medicalization and psychiatrization movement of human suffering. Training programmes should teach about mental health nursing problems rather than disorders. However, there seem to be no studies describing these healthier interventions targeting adolescents in upper secondary schools. Nurses can explore these interventions and target them towards these participants and contexts. What the paper adds to existing knowledge? The perspective of nurses on the characteristics of Mental Health First Aid Training Programmes for adolescents in Portuguese upper secondary schools is reported. Experts recognize that the nurses who perform these interventions must have personal, pedagogical and mental health competencies. Therefore, mental health nurses may be considered. The components of mental health literacy, mental health nursing problems and a dynamic first aid plan can be taught using different classroom training strategies. What are the implications for practice? The role of mental health nurses in promoting health literacy is highlighted. They have the opportunity to lead multidisciplinary teams in using these healthier training programmes. These expert opinions can shape the planning, implementation and evaluation of these interventions. In turn, training programmes can promote the identification, assistance and/or adequate and timely referral of people with mental health nursing problems. Introduction Mental Health First Aid Training Programmes performed by nurses can empower adolescents to aid people with mental health problems. There do not appear to be any studies that describe these healthier interventions aimed at adolescents in upper secondary schools. The development of these educational interventions benefits from the input of their participants and facilitators. Aim To explore the perspective of nurses about Mental Health First Aid Training Programmes for adolescents in upper secondary schools. Method A qualitative, descriptive and exploratory study was conducted. Data were collected from seven mental health nurses during two focus group sessions. Data were analysed using content analysis. Results Twelve themes were identified around nine main areas: facilitators, intervention foci, outcomes assessment methods, process assessment methods, participants, implementation context, duration and frequency, intervention methods and strategies, and contents. Discussion Mental health nurses can regularly perform these classroom interventions to improve the mental health competencies of adolescents. Various educational methods can facilitate learning related to mental health literacy components, mental health nursing problems and the first aid plan. Valid and appropriate assessment methods enhance a good representation of these interventions. Implications for Practice This evidence can guide the creation and modelling of these first aid training programmes.

TI  - Application of the "hospital-school-home-community" integrated mental health service model for primary and secondary school students in Chongqing, China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Childhood and adolescence are critical periods for mental health development, with a significant risk for mental disorders. The Chinese government has prioritized student health and well-being, encouraging policies to support youth mental health. However, challenges remain due to high technical demands and inter-departmental coordination. Methods: The "pathway through care" model connects hospitals, schools, communities, and families to collaboratively promote adolescent mental health. The model employs general screening, interviews, and intervention strategies at various levels, including mental health promotion and training for students, educators, and parents. The model's operation is led by a tertiary care team in collaboration with school districts. Results: Since the implementation of the model in Chongqing, a large-scale screening of students has been conducted, with over 330,000 students screened and a significant number receiving face-to-face interviews with psychiatrists/psychologists. The model has facilitated the early identification of students at risk, appropriate referrals for care, and ongoing support within the school setting. It has also engaged parents and the wider community in addressing youth mental health needs. Conclusions: The "Hospital-School-Home-Community" integrated mental health service model has demonstrated success in improving child and youth mental health within the school setting in Chongqing. It has effectively linked education and health systems to address a full continuum of care.

AB  - BackgroundSchool-based mental health promotion aims to strengthen mental health and reduce stress. Results on the effectiveness of such programs are heterogeneous. This study realized a school-based mental health promotion program (StresSOS) for all students and aimed to identify moderators (mental health status, gender, grade level) of pre- to post-changes in stress symptoms and knowledge.MethodsParticipants were N = 510 adolescents (from 29 classes; 46.7% female) aged 12-18 years (M = 13.88, SD = 1.00; grade levels 7-10). They were without mental health problems (65.9%), at risk for mental health problems (21.6%), or with mental health problems (12.5%) and participated in a 90 min per week face-to-face training with 8 sessions in class at school. Demographic variables, mental health status, stress symptoms, and knowledge about stress and mental health were collected at baseline. Program acceptance, stress symptoms, and knowledge were collected post-intervention. Multilevel mixed effects models were conducted with the fixed effects time (within factor), mental health status, gender, and grade level (between factors). Random effects for students within classes were included.ResultsIn the pre-post comparison, mental health status moderated the changes on psychological stress symptoms (p Copyright: CC BY 4.0

TI  - Pilot Wellness Program With Adapted Social-Emotional Learning and COVID-19 Curriculum for Refugee Youth
T2  - HEALTH EDUCATION & BEHAVIOR
M3  - Article
AB  - Refugee children are less likely than their non-refugee peers to receive timely diagnoses and treatment for mental and/or behavioral health problems, despite facing multiple risk factors including potential exposure to trauma during premigration, migration, and postmigration experiences. Social-Emotional Learning offers preventive mental health education for children through well-established, evidenced-based curricula. Although there are clear benefits of Social-Emotional Learning curricula, which can help children achieve long-term success emotionally and academically, Social-Emotional Learning curricula are not easily accessible for refugee children, often because of language and socioeconomic barriers. In this pilot study, we evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of an adapted Social-Emotional Learning program that included culturally specific, multilingual, trauma-informed wellness, and physical education during the COVID-19 pandemic: EMPOWER (Emotions Program Outside the Clinic With Wellness Education for Refugees). We used the Intervention Mapping framework which guided the (1) planning, (2) program development, and (3) mixed-method evaluation of the feasibility and acceptability of the EMPOWER pilot. We found that this adaptation was well-received by Afghan refugee families and that COVID-19 safety measures were well-understood after participation. Challenges emerged around videoconferencing connectivity and around finding a common language for discussing emotions. Future iterations of the program and evaluations will require continued partnerships with community members and organizations. As we continue and expand EMPOWER, we aim to evaluate short-term improvement in Social-Emotional Learning competence as well as long-term mental and behavioral health outcomes for children and their families.

TI  - Virtual reality for experiential learning: enhancing agitation management skills, confidence, and empathy in healthcare students
T2  - MEDICAL EDUCATION ONLINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Agitation in healthcare, particularly in psychiatric settings, is a prevalent and escalating global concern. Despite its significance, healthcare students often feel underprepared to manage agitation, citing fear, stigma, and limited clinical exposure. Traditional teaching methods, such as lectures or simulations, are resource-intensive and offer limited opportunities for repeated practice in low-risk environments. Virtual reality (VR) offers a promising alternative, providing immersive, standardised, and repeatable training for high-stress clinical scenarios. In response, the education team at [redacted for peer review], developed the Managing AGgression using Immersive Content (MAGIC) programme. This three-hour blended learning workshop, a mandatory component of the psychiatry curriculum for medical and nursing students, integrates didactic teaching, role-play, and the Virtual Reality in Agitation Management (VRAM) activity. Through experiential learning, MAGIC aims to enhance healthcare students' confidence, empathy, mental health literacy, and competence in managing agitation in psychiatric healthcare settings. Using a pre- and post-test quasi-experimental design, we evaluated the programme's effectiveness among 152 medical and nursing students. Results demonstrated significant improvements in mental health literacy, self-perceived proficiency, and confidence in managing agitated patients; there was also a marked reduction in stigma towards individuals with mental health conditions. In addition, participants responded positively to all aspects of the VRAM software, underscoring its usability and educational value. These findings highlight the potential of integrating immersive VR technology with traditional pedagogical methods to transform healthcare education by fostering deeper engagement, enhancing clinical competence, and ultimately improving patient outcomes.

TI  - Evaluation of an integrated mental health and substance use video-based prevention program for Filipino youth
T2  - DRUGS HABITS AND SOCIAL POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeDrug prevention programs typically focus on providing information on the effects of drugs and developing refusal skills. However, there is evidence that adolescents use substances to cope with stress. As such, integrating mental health literacy is important in prevention programs. The purpose of this study was to test a video-based mental health and substance prevention program for Filipino youth.Design/methodology/approachThe study used a cluster randomized trial and mixed methods design with 623 Filipino adolescents from 12 to 18 years old. The program consisted of six sessions focusing on stress, adaptive coping, effects of substances and drug refusal skills. It uses short psychoeducation videos along with self-reflection, and discussions to increase learner engagement.FindingsResults revealed a significant increase in knowledge and negative attitudes toward substance of participants in the intervention group compared to the control group. Those in the intervention group reported improved use of adaptive coping skills particularly cognitive reappraisal, social support, problem-solving and relaxation compared to the control group.Originality/valueThis study adds to the literature on prevention from under-represented and non-Western contexts such as the Philippines. This study highlights how technology-mediated and integrated mental health and substance use programs can be useful in countries with few resources for mental health.

TI  - Response to Tomalski et al. (2019): Recommendations for Adapting a Comprehensive Athlete Mental Health Screening Program for Broad Dissemination
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPORT PSYCHOLOGY IN ACTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mental health screening of athletes is of increasing concern to key stakeholders (e.g., sport administrators, psychologists, performance consultants, and coaches) at many institutions and governing bodies in the United States. Recently, Tomalski et al. (2019) described the implementation of a comprehensive collegiate student-athlete mental health screening program, including recommendations for professionals interested in replicating this program at other institutions. This excellent program involves resources and staffing that many institutions may not have. The current paper describes a variety of recommended adaptations of this comprehensive program and additional considerations to help professionals who have fewer resources or less institutional support to implement key aspects of student-athlete mental health screening. Specifically, recommendations for how to address staffing and time limitations, identify mental health providers, select screening questionnaires that maximize classification accuracy, and encourage accurate student-athlete reporting of mental health concerns are provided. Moreover, we emphasize the importance and utility of supporting mental health literacy of coaching staff as a cornerstone to effective mental health screening and intervention with collegiate student-athletes.

AB  - Friendships are crucial in adolescent development. This paper presents a scoping review, followed by a systematic review, to assess friendship interventions and their impacts on the mental health outcomes of adolescents aged 12-24 years. Studies were included if they incorporated a friend or authentic social group in an intervention dedicated to improving mental health outcomes and well-being. Twenty-four studies were included in the scoping review, and eighteen in the systematic review. Data from 12,815 adolescents were analysed; three prominent themes emerged. The most common theme was promoting mental health literacy, followed by supporting help-seeking, and friendship-building/combating isolation. Most evaluations focused on the individual who had received the intervention, rather than their wider friends who would have been potential contacts and experienced any altered interactions. Of the studies focusing on friendship-building, all had positive short-term outcomes but inconclusive long-term effects. Two studies recruited friends from an individual's authentic social group. While opportunities for improving mental health literacy and help-seeking emerged as key themes, the role of friends in mental health interventions has only been included in a small number of studies. Given that friends are a key point of contact for many adolescents, a better understanding of their domains of influence, particularly on mental health, will potentially enhance interventions.

TI  - Summarising Quantitative Outcomes in Parental Mental Illness Research
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH NURSING
M3  - Review
AB  - A quarter of all children grow up in a family where a parent experiences a mental illness (FaPMI). Research activity in this area is growing rapidly and it is now critical to better understand the extant knowledge in the field. This scoping review of quantitative FaPMI literature parallels a qualitative literature review and a series of Delphi studies with key stakeholders (e.g. lived experience and clinicians), that is part of a larger program of research to achieve consensus regarding the direction of FaPMI research; including making recommendations about outcomes and measures. The programme of research aims to promote and facilitate greater comparison and learning across studies and settings. Initially this scoping review summarises the quality and focus (e.g. country and sampling) of 50 quantitative studies from 2000 to 2023 and then classifies studies according to outcomes for parents, children and families. Six to eleven years were the most common child sample group and girls were slightly underrepresented (49/51) and parents were 88% mothers. Analogous parent and child outcomes were; mental illness/psychopathology, wellbeing, mental health literacy, trauma and stressful experiences, coping, help seeking/service need, within family relationships and supports, outside family relationships and supports. Additional outcomes for parents were; parenting skills, parent competence and parenting stress and for children in relation to their; cognitive functioning and caregiving. The family related outcomes were the within and outside family relationships and supports. Since 2000 there have been 136 different survey instruments employed with approximately 80% used in only one study. This suggests that the broader goals of the program of research are warranted as there is a need for less heterogeneity in measures used. Suggested areas for future research include a sampling focus on fathers, economic evaluations of programs, parent mental health literacy, trauma, genetics and integrating well-being concepts into research designs. Child research should focus on mental health literacy, the level and impact of caring responsibilities, assessing past trauma and the roles of close family and external supports.

TI  - Child ADHD and anxiety: Parent mental health literacy and information preferences
T2  - CHILD & FAMILY SOCIAL WORK
M3  - Article
AB  - This research explored parents' mental health literacy (MHL) skills (i.e., recognizing symptoms and identifying effective help-seeking strategies) for child attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and anxiety, factors associated with their MHL, and preferences for receiving information about each disorder. N = 128 parents were recruited from community organizations to participate in an online survey. Parents were randomly assigned to read one vignette depicting a child with symptoms of ADHD or anxiety. They were asked to identify the depicted problem and rate the helpfulness of potential help-seeking strategies (i.e., different health professionals and medications). They also completed measures of parental self-efficacy and parenting stress and indicated information preferences for learning about symptoms and treatment. Parents scored just above the mid-range on a measure of their MHL skills, with no significant difference between parents responding to the ADHD and anxiety vignettes. Stronger MHL was associated with being a mother, having personal, family, or friend-related mental health experience, and stronger parental self-efficacy. Parents were interested in receiving more information about child ADHD and anxiety via health provider or written format. Results are valuable for informing future MHL intervention efforts to educate parents about symptoms and treatment for common child mental health problems such as ADHD and anxiety.

TI  - Mental health literacy of adolescents in Bermuda, according to age, gender and race
T2  - HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Mental health literacy (MHL) is an important part of the help-seeking process, yet there is a lack of knowledge about the MHL of adolescents in the Caribbean. This region is important to study as it is underrepresented in mental health research globally. The aim of this study is to explore the ability of adolescents in Bermuda to recognize depression and social phobia (social anxiety) and their beliefs about the sources of help for a peer with these mental health problems. This cross-sectional study surveyed middle and high school students aged 10-19 years in Bermuda. Online surveys conducted between November 2022 and June 2023 gathered demographic data including age, gender and race, and assessed the ability to recognize depression and social anxiety from descriptions provided in randomly assigned vignettes, and beliefs about sources of help. Across 15 middle and high schools, 2423 adolescents (out of 3593 eligible participants) completed all demographic and MHL survey questions (1139 males, 1272 females). Recognition rates for depression and social anxiety were 60% and 53%, respectively. Compared to females, males endorsed a greater variety of help sources. Reporting symptoms of depression or anxiety reduced the likelihood of endorsing multiple sources of help. MHL of adolescents in Bermuda is sub-optimal, particularly for social anxiety. Mental health promotion programs may be useful in improving recognition rates.

TI  - The impact of universal, school based, interventions on help seeking in children and young people: a systematic literature review
T2  - EUROPEAN CHILD & ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Review
AB  - Reviews into universal interventions to improve help seeking in young people focus on specific concepts, such as behaviour, do not differentiate between interpersonal and intrapersonal help seeking, and often report on statistical significance, rather than effect size. The aim of this review was to address the gaps highlighted above, to investigate the impact of universal, school-based interventions on help-seeking in children and young people, as well as to explore longer term impact. Four databases were searched. Data were extracted on country of origin, design, participant, school, and intervention characteristics, the help-seeking concept measured (e.g. knowledge, attitude/intention, behaviour), the duration between baseline and each follow-up (if applicable) and effect sizes at each follow-up. Quality assessment of the studies was undertaken using the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) quality assessment tool. Overall, 14 different interventions met inclusion criteria. The majority of the studies were rated low in the quality assessment. Three constructs were most frequently reported a) intrapersonal attitudes towards help-seeking, b) interpersonal attitudes towards help-seeking and c) intrapersonal intended help-seeking. Findings around intervention effect were mixed. There was tentative evidence that interventions impacting interpersonal attitudes produced small effect sizes when measured between 3 and 6 months post intervention and that when effect sizes were initially observed intrapersonal attitudes, this remained at 3-6 month follow-up. Further work should pay attention to implementation factors, understanding the core ingredients needed to deliver effective interventions and whether embedding mental health education could help sustain or top up effect sizes from help-seeking interventions.

TI  - Sports coaches' depression literacy, and engagement in prevention and early intervention behaviors: A moderated mediation analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED SPORT PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coaches' mental health literacy is associated with increased engagement in prevention and early intervention behaviors. However, few studies have explored the factors that may influence these relationships. The purpose of this study was to explore whether role breadth and role efficacy mediate the relationship between coach depression literacy and prevention and early intervention, and to assess whether gender or stigma moderates any mediation effects. One thousand and forty five coaches (M = 42.71 years old; SD = 11.52; 30% female) completed an online survey exploring depression literacy, personal stigma, role breadth and efficacy and engagement in prevention and early intervention. Path analysis was conducted, followed by mediation and moderated-mediation analyzes. The overarching model for each behavior was confirmed. Role efficacy but not role breadth partially mediated the relationship between depression literacy and each behavior. Gender did not moderate any mediation relationships. Personal stigma moderated the relationship between depression literacy and prevention and early intervention. Coaches with lower levels of personal stigma, reported higher levels of depression literacy and were more confident to engage in prevention and early intervention. Increasing coaches' knowledge and confidence may lead to increased engagement in prevention and early intervention. However, for coaches with high levels of personal stigma, approaches that go beyond the provision of knowledge may be required.LAY SUMMARYThis study explores the relationship between coaches' knowledge of depression and their engagement in behaviors that support young people's mental health. It also examines how confident coaches feel to engage in these behaviors and whether the gender or stigmatizing attitudes of coaches might influence these relationships.

TI  - Mental health education for physiotherapists: A scoping review
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Physiotherapists play an integral role in the management of people living with a mental illness, yet little is known about their knowledge, attitudes and perceptions about mental health globally and particularly in South Africa.Aim: The purpose of the study is to map global evidence on mental health education for physiotherapists, including their knowledge, attitude and perceptions, with the goal of using this information to design an improved undergraduate curriculum for physiotherapy in South Africa.Setting: The search was focused on the South African and global context, with the participants as physiotherapists and physiotherapy students.Methods: The methodical framework proposed by Arksey and O'Malleys guided the scoping review. The online search used five electronic databases. An expert librarian assisted in the search strategy. English language, primary research articles that investigated physiotherapist or physiotherapy students' knowledge, attitude and perceptions towards mental health were sought.Results: The search strategy extracted 226 published studies and 15 studies were included in the analysis. The results indicated that globally physiotherapists and physiotherapy students had limited knowledge about mental health. Improved attitudes were noted with a mental health training intervention. Negative perceptions were associated with limited knowledge.Conclusion: There was limited literature on the influence of education on mental health in physiotherapy on attitudes and perceptions. Physiotherapists desired more knowledge about mental health because of the prevalence of mental health disorders.Contribution: Because of the increasing prevalence of mental illness globally, the findings of this review suggest the necessity of integrating mental health content in the physiotherapists' undergraduate programme to provide high-quality care physiotherapy management for people with mental illnesses.

TI  - Validation of the Arabic version of the Mental Health Literacy Scale (MHLS) in three Arab samples
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mental Health Literacy (MHL) is pivotal for understanding and addressing mental disorders, often assessed using the comprehensive Mental Health Literacy Scale (MHLS) across six dimensions and 35 items. However, research on MHL within Arab populations is not just scarce, but alarmingly so, indicating a significant gap in knowledge regarding MHL in this demographic. This study aimed to fill this gap by adapting the MHLS into Arabic and evaluating its psychometric properties among three distinct Arabic-speaking groups: adolescents, students, and the general public. Data were collected using the translated MHLS, the General Health Questionnaire, and sociodemographic measures, employing a cross-sectional design. Validation procedures were conducted, including exploratory factor analysis, reliability testing, and face validity assessment. Construct validity was assessed using Pearson correlation analysis and t-tests. The validation process yielded three modified versions of the MHLS in Arabic: MHLS-Arabic-Adolescents (31 items, 5 factors), MHLS-Arabic-Students (30 items, 6 factors), and MHLS-Arabic-General Public (33 items, 5 factors). These tools demonstrated robust construct validity and high-reliability coefficients and stood as a testament to their adaptability and potential for use in diverse Arabic-speaking populations. This study suggests the nuanced nature of MHL and points to the importance of micro-context-specific validation. Providing three reliable MHLS Arabic versions could facilitate research on MHL among Arabic-speaking populations worldwide, potentially leading to tailored intervention initiatives that aim to enhance mental health outcomes and ensure equitable access to services within Arab communities globally.

TI  - The Relationship Between Mental Health Literacy and Mental Illness Attitudes and Knowledge: A Structural Equation Model
T2  - PERSPECTIVES IN PSYCHIATRIC CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Enhancing mental health literacy (MHL) through school-based education intervention may encourage mental health promotion, prevention, and care and reduce stigma in adolescents. Over the last few decades, this has been a major area of interest for researchers and health planners. This study aims to explore the relationship between knowledge and attitude to mental disorders with students' MHL. Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in 2023 in Sirjan. The statistical population included all the students of the first secondary schools selected through a multistage cluster random sampling method. The study ultimately involved 562 male and female students. Data were gathered through a MHL questionnaire, Mental Health Knowledge Questionnaire (MHKQ), and Attitudes to Mental Illness Questionnaire (AMIQ) along with a demographic information checklist. SPSS and AMOS Version 26 software were used in the statistical analysis. Results: The findings showed that mental health knowledge has a direct (0.15) and indirect (0.36) effect on MHL (p > 0.001). MHL has a direct and significant effect on knowledge of risk factors and causes (0.28), knowledge of self-treatment (0.15), knowledge of professional help available (0.33), and knowledge of where to seek information (0.61). Moreover, MHL had a direct and inverse effect on appropriate help-seeking behavior (-0.98). Conclusion: This study found that individuals with greater MHL exhibit more appropriate behavior and knowledge regarding mental illness or disorders. Thus, it is recommended that mental health be emphasized in educational programs to help students tackle the daily challenges of adolescence.

TI  - Characteristics of mental health literacy measurement in youth: a scoping review of school-based surveys
T2  - DISCOVER MENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Mental health literacy (MHL) was introduced 25 years ago as knowledge and beliefs about mental disorders which aid in their recognition, management, or prevention. This scoping review mapped the peer-reviewed literature to assess characteristics of secondary school-based surveys in school-attending youth and explore components of school-based programs for fostering MHL in this population. The search was performed following the method for scoping reviews by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI). Searches were conducted in four scientific databases with no time limit, although all sources had to be written in English. Primary studies (N = 44) provided insight into MHL surveys and programs for school-attending youth across 6 continents. Studies reported that most youth experience moderate or low MHL prior to program participation. School-based MHL programs are relatively unified in their definition and measures of MHL, using closed-ended scales, vignettes, or a combination of the two to measure youth MHL. However, before developing additional interventions, steps should be taken to address areas of weakness in current programming, such as the lack of a standardized tool for assessing MHL levels. Future research could assess the feasibility of developing and implementing a standard measurement protocol, with educator perspectives on integrating MHL efforts into the classroom. Identifying the base levels of MHL amongst school-attending youth promotes the development of targeted programs and reviewing the alignment with program components would allow researchers to build on what works, alter what does not, and come away with new ways to approach these complex challenges, ultimately advancing knowledge of MHL and improving levels of MHL.

TI  - Mental health literacy websites for children of parents with a mental illness
T2  - CLINICAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective:This review of online mental health resources was conducted to evaluate and document the availability of mental health resources pertinent to the needs of children of parents with a mental illness (COPMI). This review identified available websites and analyzed the appropriateness of content and readability.Methods:We conducted an extensive 6-month review of websites with available mental health literacy content that may be found by COPMI searching for information. Web content was evaluated and described with qualitative thematic analysis techniques. Web content was also evaluated for reading levels using the Flesch-Kincaid readability analysis tool.Results:The researchers described 7 descriptive themes, 10 content areas, and described what information was available across websites and where gaps existed. They also concluded the average reading level of the websites was 9.7, which was substantially higher than current web development recommendations.Conclusions:Websites can be a valuable tool for COPMI without access to direct services. To improve current web resources, developers should strive to offer content specific to the identified needs of COPMI. Additionally, web content should be developed at a level that is accessible to teens and parents.

TI  - Effect of human library intervention on mental health literacy: a multigroup pretest-posttest study
T2  - BMC PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Mental health literacy (MHL) is an evolving concept encompassing knowledge of mental illness, help-seeking options, perceived stigma, and discrimination. This study aimed to test the effectiveness of a human library intervention at enhancing MHL. A human library intervention was adopted to enhance MHL in this study. The human library intervention aims to establish a positive framework and safe space for dialogue between readers and a 'human book'. It works to promote dialogue, reduce prejudice, and encourage understanding of people who are regarded as disadvantaged or in a minority group. Methods An experimental approach with a multigroup pretest-posttest design was adopted. Forty-five participants aged between 18 and 23 years were recruited and randomly assigned to the experimental group (human library intervention), comparison group (didactic teaching session), or control group (no intervention). Adapted vignette-based MHL scale scores were used as the outcome measures. The overall and subscale scores were included in the analysis. Results The human library intervention group showed a significant improvement in overall MHL compared with the other two groups. In a multivariate analysis of the variance in subscale scores, the intervention was shown to significantly reduce stigma and preferred social distance, but had no significant effect on knowledge acquisition. Conclusions The human library intervention is effective at enhancing overall MHL and reducing stigma and preferred social distance. Further studies are suggested to further develop the MHL construct, human library interventions, and the MHL scales for consolidating evidence-based practice.

TI  - The development of a Community Mental Health Education and Detection (CMED) tool in South Africa
T2  - SSM-MENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Low demand for mental health services in sub-Saharan Africa is driven by poor mental health literacy, stigma, and poor service availability. Objective: To develop a Community Mental Health Education and Detection (CMED) Tool for adults for use by community health teams in South Africa aligned with their roles of health promotion, screening and linkage to care. Methods: Formative evaluation methods involving four processes: (1) Ongoing engagement with the KwaZuluNatal Department of Health (KZN DoH) to ensure co-creation of the CMED tool and alignment with routine community health team activities; (2) Adaptation of the CMED tool from the Community Informant Detection Tool (CIDT), used to promote help-seeking of people with mental health problems in Nepal; (3) Review of the CMED vignettes and illustrations by a panel of local and international mental health care experts to establish accuracy and contextual and cultural relevance; (4) Process mapping and focus group discussions (FGDs) with community health teams in one district to establish cultural and contextual appropriateness as well as coherence and compatibility with existing community-based services. Results: The resulting CMED tool consists of five case vignettes and related illustrations to facilitate psychoeducation and the detection of possible depression, anxiety, psychosis, harmful alcohol use, and drug use by community health teams. Based on prototype matching, it includes two structured questions to guide the community health teams in the detection and referral process. The tool was acceptable, culturally and contextually appropriate, and helpful for the services provided by community health teams. Challenges of working in households and the importance of self-care were highlighted as important considerations when developing training content and piloting the tool. Conclusion: Extensive consultation with the KZN DoH, community health teams, and the expert mental health panel resulted in developing a tool that was perceived to be culturally sensitive and relevant to the community package of services.

TI  - The Effect of Digital Mental Health Literacy Interventions on Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Accelerated by technological advancements and the recent global pandemic, there is burgeoning interest in digital mental health literacy (DMHL) interventions that can positively affect mental health. However, existing work remains inconclusive regarding the effectiveness of DMHL interventions. Objective: This systematic review and meta -analysis investigated the components and modes of DMHL interventions, their moderating factors, and their long-term impacts on mental health literacy and mental health. Methods: We used a random -effects model to conduct meta -analyses and meta -regressions on moderating effects of DMHL interventions on mental health. Results: Using 144 interventions with 206 effect sizes, we found a moderate effect of DMHL interventions in enhancing distal mental health outcomes (standardized mean difference=0.42, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.73; P<.001) and a large effect in increasing proximal mental health literacy outcomes (standardized mean difference=0.65, 95% CI 0.59-0.74; P<.001). Uptake of DMHL interventions was comparable with that of control conditions, and uptake of DMHL interventions did not moderate the effects on both proximal mental health literacy outcomes and distal mental health outcomes. DMHL interventions were as effective as face-to-face interventions and did not differ by platform type or dosage. DMHL plus interventions (DMHL psychoeducation coupled with other active treatment) produced large effects in bolstering mental health, were more effective than DMHL only interventions (self-help DMHL psychoeducation), and were comparable with non-DMHL interventions (treatment as usual). DMHL interventions demonstrated positive effects on mental health that were sustained over follow-up assessments and were most effective in enhancing the mental health of emerging and older adults. Conclusions: For theory building, our review and meta -analysis found that DMHL interventions are as effective as face-to-face interventions. DMHL interventions confer optimal effects on mental health when DMHL psychoeducation is combined with informal, nonprofessional active treatment components such as skills training and peer support, which demonstrate comparable effectiveness with that of treatment as usual (client -professional interactions and therapies). These effects, which did not differ by platform type or dosage, were sustained over time. Additionally, most DMHL interventions are found in Western cultural contexts, especially in high -income countries (Global North) such as Australia, the United States, and the United Kingdom, and limited research is conducted in low-income countries in Asia and in South American and African countries. Most of the DMHL studies did not report information on the racial or ethnic makeup of the samples. Future work on DMHL interventions that target racial or ethnic minority groups, particularly the design, adoption, and evaluation of the effects of culturally adaptive DMHL interventions on uptake and mental health functioning, is needed. Such evidence can drive the adoption and implementation of DMHL interventions at scale, which represents a key foundation for practice -changing impact in the provision of mental health resources for individuals and the community.

TI  - Help-Seeking Behavior and Related Mental Health Promotion Programs in Southeast Asian Youth: A Systematic Literature Review
T2  - KESMAS-NATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Mental health issues are a prominent burden among adolescents and young adults in Southeast Asia, compounded by reluctance to seek help and low treatment rates. This mixed-method systematic review analyzed help-seeking profiles (preference, facilitators, and barriers) and evaluated implemented help-seeking programs. Data were sourced from electronic databases, hand-searched local databases, conference proceedings, and grey literature. Study selection followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines, focusing on 1) adolescents (10-19 years) and young adults (18-26 years) in Southeast Asia who were not receiving mental health care, 2) assessing help-seeking behavior, and 3) evaluating programs to increase help-seeking. A total of 16 articles were identified. Help-seeking behavior Southeast Asian youth was shaped by mental health literacy and stigma (including attitudes from family, peers, and the wider community). Program effectiveness was mixed, with improvement often lacking significant differences from control groups or failing to persist at follow-up. These findings emphasized the need for more community-level and upstream policy interventions alongside individual-level interventions to improve mental health literacy and stigma. Developing interventions requires methodological improvements in help-seeking research, and ultimately, accessible and trustworthy mental health services are crucial to sustaining progress.

TI  - Early detection of eating disorders: a scoping review
T2  - EATING AND WEIGHT DISORDERS-STUDIES ON ANOREXIA BULIMIA AND OBESITY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose Early detection of eating disorders (EDs) could improve their prognosis, decrease morbidity and mortality, and prevent the risk of evolution towards a chronic form and somatic, psychiatric and psychosocial complications. The objective of this review was to examine the current scientific data concerning the early detection of EDs, which is one of the facets of secondary prevention. Method A scoping literature review was carried out following the PRISMA-ScR criteria, including all articles on ED detection published up to 2021 on PUBMED and PSYCINFO. Results 43 articles were included. Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa were the most widely studied disorders. The articles focused on professionals from the medical field (GPs, psychiatrists, gynaecologists, gastroenterologists and residents), from the paramedical field, from education and sport, and from the general population. The assessments conducted with the professionals receiving interventions aiming to improve detection demonstrated their efficacy. Interventions for ED detection in the general population and at school seemed less efficacious. Conclusion The results highlighted some lines of action to be implemented. They pointed towards improving initial and continuing education for professional carers; e-learning could be an interesting solution for continuing education. Improving training with specific instructors, school personnel and sports professionals is also one of the solutions for a better detection of EDs. Specific recommendations could be published for fitness centre professionals to help them to deal with clients suspected of having an ED. Among secondary school students and in the general population, a better dissemination of mental health literacy and the development of mental health first aid programs could help improve early detection.

TI  - Mental health literacy in nursing students: Insights from a cross-sectional analysis
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mental health literacy is crucial for nursing students to deliver effective patient care; however, its development throughout their academic journey remains underexplored. This study aimed to assess mental health literacy among nursing students in the UAE and examine factors influencing their literacy levels. A quantitative cross-sectional study was conducted from February 2024 to August 2024 using convenience sampling. A total of 295 undergraduate nursing students participated in the study. Data were collected using the Mental Health Literacy Questionnaire (MHLq) and analyzed using SPSS software (version 24). Descriptive and inferential analyses were conducted to calculate means, standard deviations, percentages, and measures of association using t-tests for students' sociodemographic variables, dimensions, and global scores, with a significance level of 0.05 for the tests. The findings indicated that participants (all female, with a mean age of 20.7 +/- 1.85 years) had a mean MHLq score of 108.19 +/- 10.53. Fourth-year students scored higher (110.78 +/- 9.79) than lower-year students (106.85 +/- 10.68). Students with family or friends who were affected had higher scores (48.00 +/- 6.16) than those without (45.97 +/- 6.16). The highest-scoring domain was knowledge of mental health problems (46.59 +/- 6.40), while self-help strategies scored lowest (16.99 +/- 2.61). Students with a personal history of mental illness had lower scores. The study also indicated a statistically significant association between students' marital status, their level of study, and their first-aid skills and help-seeking behavior. The study highlights the importance of integrating mental health literacy into undergraduate nursing curricula to enhance student's ability to provide patient-centered care for individuals with mental health disorders. Implementing targeted educational strategies focusing on awareness, recognition, and communication may strengthen students' competency and preparedness for mental health care practice.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE EDUCATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Mental illness impacts billions, globally. While mental illness does not predict criminality, many individuals with mental health needs find themselves within the various decision points of the criminal legal system. Research shows that individuals experiencing a mental health challenge and/or crisis are at greater risk for a law enforcement encounter, police use-of-forth, detainment in jail, and court and correctional system involvement. Yet, research has found that increased knowledge surrounding mental illness can reduce negative criminal legal system involvement. As such, the current sample included undergraduate criminal justice students enrolled in an elective course that included Mental Health First Aid (MHFA)-an evidence-based intervention training. In the current study, MHFA was part of the course curriculum. Enrolled students completed both a pre- and post-test questionnaire (at the beginning and end of the course) to measure changes in their mental illness literacy for depression, mental illness stigma, and mental illness microaggressions. Results support the implementation of MHFA to undergraduate criminal justice students, as students had an increase in mental illness literacy, and decreases in mental illness stigma and microaggressions. These findings encourage more colleges and universities to offer MHFA to promote peer support as well as professional knowledge for those who will work within the criminal legal system.

TI  - Improving adolescents' knowledge about mental health and depression: a randomized experimental study of web-based information
T2  - FRONTIERS IN DIGITAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Adolescents often lack adequate knowledge about mental health and available professional support, which hinders timely help-seeking. As many adolescents seek information online, providing reliable web-based resources may enhance their mental health literacy. This randomized experimental study (preregistered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05300217) examined the effectiveness and reception of innovative online information designed to improve adolescents' knowledge of depression and mental health. A total of 77 adolescents aged 12-18 years were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: (1) web-based information on depression or (2) web-based information on strategies to promote mental health. Both interventions were derived from the evidence-based website "ich bin alles" (English translation: "I am everything"). Primary outcomes were knowledge of depression and knowledge of strategies to promote mental health, assessed immediately after the intervention and at 2- and 4-week follow-ups. Secondary outcomes included perceived visual aesthetics, ease of use, utility, and enjoyment. Adolescents showed significant increases in knowledge of depression [F (3, 76.67) = 13.29, p < .001] and knowledge of strategies to promote mental health [F (3, 76.41) = 7.89, p <.001] over time, attributable to the assigned information. Participants also rated the website's visual aesthetics, ease of use, utility, and enjoyment positively. Age-appropriate, visually appealing web-based information effectively improved adolescents' knowledge of depression and mental health. Freely accessible, evidence-based online resources represent a scalable strategy to strengthen mental health literacy among young people.

TI  - What was done for young people aged 10 to 24 in Singapore? A systematic review on mental health interventions
T2  - CURRENT PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - While Singapore is celebrated for its world-class economy and education system, it still grapples with mental health challenges among young people, highlighting the urgent need for early intervention and effective treatment for this population. Hence, this systematic review aimed to identify mental health interventions for young people aged 10 to 24 in Singapore. Databases including PubMed, CINAHL Complete, APA PsycArticles, APA PsycInfo, and Scopus were searched until September 23, 2023, resulting in the identification of five studies (N = 397) conducted between 2017 and 2023. They were analysed following the latest Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline, with the risk of bias and levels of evidence assessed. The studies covered diverse populations ranging from students to youth offenders, addressing various mental health concerns such as autism spectrum disorder, anxiety, social withdrawal, and mental health literacy. While three studies reported positive outcomes but two of them too raised concerns about measurement validity, intervention rigor, and sample size. Overall, the review revealed significant heterogeneity in both intervention outcomes and delivery methods among mental health interventions for young people in Singapore, making comparisons challenging and definitive conclusions difficult to draw. Additionally, the review underscored the scarcity of published interventions for this demographic, highlighting the urgent need for more tailored and evidence-based approaches. Nonetheless, it emphasizes the importance of addressing this gap and advocates for more research to inform evidence-based practices and policies, providing valuable insights for mental health professionals, policymakers, and researchers aiming to enhance the well-being of Singapore's young population.

In response to the fragmentation of traditional mental health education in Chinese universities, the model incorporates ecosystem theory, embodied cognition, and multi-agent collaboration to build a four-dimensional support system: curriculum-practice integration, internal-external stakeholder synergy, environmental optimization, and institutional sustainability. Through immersive practices like psychodrama, mind mapping, and mindful walking, students' psychological capital and self-regulation abilities are enhanced. The model emphasizes collaboration across psychological, educational, and managerial units, as well as coordination with families, communities, medical institutions, and enterprises. By combining physical space design with digital tracking platforms, the ecosystem enables all-scenario psychological support. Challenges such as insufficient longitudinal validation, ethical concerns in AI-driven interventions, and uneven resource allocation remain. This study provides a localized and actionable framework for advancing youth mental health in higher education, supporting a shift from crisis intervention to positive psychological development.

TI  - Mixed Reality in Undergraduate Mental Health Education: A Systematic Review
T2  - ELECTRONICS
M3  - Review
AB  - The landscape of Extended Reality (ER), which includes Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR) is rapidly changing. However, despite the promising results from many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) developed on healthcare environments, there is a lack of standardization, specifically to determine their effectiveness in academic settings. To our best knowledge, this is the first systematic review addressing the efficacy of MR to enhance learning and skills acquisition in undergraduate mental health education. The purposes of this study were to review the scientific literature of those studies involving MR and undergraduate mental health education, to answer the two following questions: (1) Is MR useful to enhance the acquisition of knowledge and skill training in undergraduate mental health education, and (2) Which are the advantages and disadvantages that should be addressed to successfully develop MR in undergraduate mental health education? We conducted a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature from EBSCO, Ovid, PubMed, and Scopus y WOS (Web of Science), following the PRISMA statements and using "mixed reality + education", "mixed reality + student", "mixed reality + undergraduate", and "mixed reality + mental health", as keywords. Those studies published between 2012 to present, in English or Spanish language, were reviewed. A total of 2608 records were retrieved, and only 6 publications met the inclusion criteria, and were finally included. MR training used was varied. There were no studies providing specific outcomes regarding the student's acquired knowledge (theoretical concepts) after using MR. Several strengths and weaknesses of using MR with students were discussed. The results will be useful to develop innovative MR strategies to improve undergraduate mental health education, due to the lack of studies focused on this topic.

TI  - Working With People With Experience of Psychosis to Co-Design an Educational and Anti-Stigma Psychosis Intervention for Schools
T2  - HEALTH EXPECTATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Psychosis is a particularly stigmatised condition in adolescent populations, with prevalent stigmatising beliefs surrounding it including negative stereotypes around dangerousness, unpredictability and chronicity. Additionally, the first episodes of psychosis increase significantly during late adolescence, and there is a lack of understanding and recognition of psychosis in young people. Given these factors, psychosis appears to be an important topic for mental health literacy and anti-stigma programmes. However, there is a lack of consensus surrounding the best way to construct psychosis anti-stigma interventions for young people. Voices of people with experience of psychosis seem crucial in this regard, but their experiences of stigma and discrimination are rarely heard. By including their perspectives along with those of other stakeholders, we aim to ensure that we gain a better, more balanced perspective on how to talk about psychosis with young people. Methods: This study reports on the co-design process of a psychosis anti-stigma educational intervention for young people using the short-form Guidance for Reporting Involvement of Patients and the Public (GRIPP-2) checklist as a guiding framework. Six workshops were held over 3 months, with experts with experience of psychosis working with clinicians and academics. These workshops explored the differing views of these groups on how we understand, talk about and perceive psychosis. Results: This process resulted in an educational module named 'Reality and Psychosis', which we believe will prove effective in not only educating but also diminishing stigma surrounding psychosis among young people. Conclusion: By incorporating various perspectives, we hope to provide a well-rounded and balanced approach to addressing the complexities of discussing psychosis with young people. The GRIPP-2 checklist also proved to be a useful framework for assisting the reporting process. Patient or Public Contribution: Individuals with lived experience of psychosis participated throughout the co-design process. Specifically, they contributed to the six workshops by sharing their personal experiences of stigma, discrimination and recovery, which informed the development of the educational module. This helped ensure the voices of those directly affected by psychosis were authentically represented.

TI  - Universal digital mental health interventions for children and youth: a scoping review
T2  - FRONTIERS IN DIGITAL HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) are increasingly used to support child and youth mental health, yet the scope and characteristics of universal (Tier 1) DMHIs remain poorly defined. Methods: This scoping review synthesized peer- reviewed studies of universal DMHIs delivered to children and youth aged 0-18 years. Results: Use of online programs and hybrid delivery were prevalent. Many programs used an independent structure, while facilitation varied across self- led, facilitator-led, and both-led models. Outcomes were commonly assessed across multiple domains, including emotional, behavioural, social, and cognitive outcomes. When single domains were examined, these most often focused on emotional outcomes such as anxiety and depression. Interventions frequently employed therapeutic approaches such as cognitive behavioural therapy and psychoeducation, with content emphasizing emotion regulation, coping and problem-solving skills, and mental health literacy. Structural features varied in length and number of sessions, and many included scaffolded self-managed elements such as messaging or check-ins. Early childhood was underrepresented, with limited reporting of child outcomes for ages 0-4. Equity considerations were also limited, as many studies did not report race or ethnicity and sex and gender reporting was often binary or unspecified. Youth involvement in intervention design or consultation was uncommon. Discussion: This review provides an overview of the current landscape and identifies key gaps, including limited equity considerations, the underrepresentation of early childhood development, and minimal youth involvement. Clearer reporting of delivery structure and facilitation, stronger demographic reporting, and component-focused evaluation can support equitable, developmentally responsive scale-up.

TI  - Attitude Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help Among Community-Dwelling Population in China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To explore the attitudes and factors in seeking professional psychological help among a Chinese community-dwelling population in order to promote positive help-seeking behaviors and better utilization of mental health services. Methods Using system and simple random sampling with Kish selection table methods, 912 community-dwelling residents were included in this study and asked about their attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help, depression symptoms, family function, depression literacy, help-seeking intention, and stigma. Results Scores on the Attitudes Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help scale (ATSPPH-SF) indicated a neutral attitude toward openness to seeking treatment for psychological problems and a negative attitude toward the value and need to seek treatment with a negative total score. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that gender, age, social support (employment status and family function), depression literacy, stigma, and help-seeking intention are significantly associated with attitude toward seeking professional psychological help. Conclusion The overall attitude toward seeking professional psychological help is not optimistic, thus, more efforts are needed to enhance understanding. Effective interventions including mental health education, training of mental health professionals, and popularizing the use of mental health services are essential, especially for the at-risk population.

TI  - Effectiveness of teen Mental Health First Aid in Improving Teen-to-Teen Support Among American Adolescents
T2  - JOURNAL OF SCHOOL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: teen Mental Health First Aid (tMHFA) is an Australian school-based universal program for grade 10 to 12 students. tMHFA teaches teens how to recognize and respond to a peer in crisis or experiencing mental health concerns.METHODS: Schools implementing tMHFA in 2019 and 2020 were propensity score matched, yielding a sample of instructors (n= 130) and students (n= 1915) in 44 high schools in 24 American states. Effectiveness and acceptability were assessed with student surveys at baseline and after implementation.RESULTS: There were significant findings for primary outcomes, including improved helpful first aid intentions (Cohen ds= 0.57 to 0.58), confidence supporting a peer (ds= 0.19 to 0.31); the number of adults rated as helpful (ds= 0.37 to 0.44); and reductions in stigmatizing beliefs (ds= 0.21 to 0.40) and ''harmful first aid intentions'' (ds= 0.11 to 0.42). Instructors and students rated the program favorably with students sharing improvements on their recognition and responses to mental health problems and crises.CONCLUSION: tMHFA is an effective, feasible, and scalable training program for increasing mental health literacy and decreasing mental health stigma in adolescents in the short term, consistent with trials of tMHFA in Australian adolescents.

TI  - The effectiveness of mental health literacy digital awareness campaign on social discrimination, willingness to seek professional psychological help, and intended behaviors among high school students in Jordan
T2  - DIGITAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The study aimed to assess the effectiveness of mental health literacy digital awareness campaign, on the levels of social discrimination against mental illness, willingness to seek professional psychological help, and intended future behaviors among high school students in Jordan.Methods: A one-group pre-test-post-test study design was used, involving 43 high school students. The intervention included posting podcast series and reels through private Facebook groups over 1 month.Results: The students demonstrated significantly lowered perception of social discrimination ((sic) = 0.35, p < .001), more intended future behaviors ((sic) = 0.08, p < .001), and increased willingness to seek help ((sic) = 0.84, p = .029) over time. The magnitude of these changes was large for social discrimination (Cohen's d = 1.34) and intended behaviors (d = 3.00), and small to medium for willingness to seek help (d = 0.42). Male students (M = 16.3, SD = 2.1) scored significantly lower in willingness to seek help (M = 18.4, SD = 2.6) than females. Those with prior psychological referrals had higher social discrimination (t = 2.47, p = .018).Conclusion: This study offers school mental health professionals a valuable tool to support high school students through accessible platforms like social media.

TI  - Educational Approaches Using Simulation for Psychiatric Risk Assessment: a Scoping Review
T2  - ACADEMIC PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Review
AB  - ObjectiveThe ability to assess a patient's risk of harm to self or others is a core competency for mental health clinicians which can have significant patient outcomes. With the growth of simulation in medical education, there is an opportunity to enhance education outcomes for psychiatric risk assessment. The purpose of this study was to determine how simulation is used to build competency in risk assessment and map its educational outcomes.MethodsThe authors conducted a systematic scoping review using the Arksey and O'Malley framework. Electronic database searches were conducted by an academic librarian. Studies published before August 2022 which described simulation activities aimed at training clinicians in suicide, self-harm, and/or violence risk assessment were screened for eligibility.ResultsOf the 21,814 articles identified, 58 studies were selected for inclusion. The majority described simulations teaching suicide risk assessment, and there was a notable gap for building competency in violence risk assessment. Simulation utility was demonstrated across emergency, inpatient, and outpatient settings involving adult and pediatric care. The most common simulation modality was patient actors. A smaller subset implemented technological approaches, such as automated virtual patient avatars. Outcomes included high learner satisfaction, and increases in psychiatric risk assessment knowledge, competency, and performance.ConclusionSimulation as an adjuvant to existing medical curricula can be used to teach risk assessment in mental health. Based on the results of our review, the authors provide recommendations for medical educators looking to design and implement simulation in mental health education.

TI  - Early Developmental Crime Prevention and Social Impact over the Life Course
T2  - ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Preventing the development of criminal potential in young people is an important component of broader crime reduction strategies. A key feature of developmental crime prevention is a comprehensive effort to improve the life chances of at-risk children and families, and there is evidence that doing so improves long-term life-course outcomes like physical health, mental health, education, and employment. We assess available research evidence from 12 high-quality studies of developmental crime prevention initiatives and find that extensive use of multimodal interventions helps to foster cumulative protection over the life course, that there are significant improvements in other outcomes over the life course, that there are promising signs of intergenerational transmission of the intervention effects, and that there is strong support for these sorts of interventions from the perspective of benefit-cost analysis. We also discuss implications for public policy and research.

TI  - Fostering Resilience in Adolescents at Risk: Study protocol for a cluster randomized controlled trial within the resilience school-based intervention
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionResilience is considered of high relevance when developing interventions to cope with stressful situations. Schools are one of the key settings to promote resilience among adolescents. The purpose of this cluster randomized controlled trial is to assess the effectiveness of an intervention in adolescents at risk, aged 12-to-15 years old, to increase resilience and emotional regulation strategies.MethodsThe recruitment period started in January 2022. Schools will be randomly allocated to control and intervention groups by an external researcher using computer-generated random numbers. The minimum sample size was estimated to be 70 participants per group. Primary health care nurses will carry out the intervention during the school period (January to June 2022). Students will follow a specific training consisting of six 55-min sessions, for 6 weeks. Each session will consist of 5 min of mindfulness, followed by 45 min of the corresponding activity: introducing resilience, self-esteem, emotional regulation strategies, social skills, problem-solving, community resources, social and peer support, and 5 min to explain the activity to do at home. Data will be collected at baseline, 6 weeks, and 24 weeks after the intervention. The child youth resilience measure-32 (CYRM-32) scale will be used to assess the effectiveness of the intervention. This study received a grant in June 2021.DiscussionThe intervention is intended to improve mental health through resilience. Different factors related to resilience will be promoted, such as self-esteem, emotional regulation, social and communication skills, problem-solving and peer support, among others. As it has been designed as a cluster-randomized school-based intervention, we will directly ameliorate the participation and engagement of the target population. With the present intervention, we expect to improve coping skills in adolescents by enhancing resilience capacities.

TI  - What do parents know and feel about mental health in young children? A mixed methods systematic review of global parental mental health literacy
T2  - CURRENT PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the global rise in child mental health difficulties, public understanding of young children's mental health remains unclear. Parents play a pivotal role in supporting their children's mental health and seeking professional help for concerns. Our mixed-methods systematic review sought to describe current levels of child mental health literacy (CMHL) among parents, examine variations across sociodemographic and clinical factors, and explore the relationship between CMHL and professional help-seeking. We searched six databases for English-language studies investigating any aspect of CMHL among parents of children aged 4-12 years in community settings, published in the last decade. From 26 studies across 12 countries (N = 5562), we found that parents generally had: (1) low to moderately low recognition, (2) diverse causal and other mental health beliefs (in Western and non-Western countries), (3) high levels of stigmatising beliefs and perceived stigma; (4) attitudes to professional help-seeking ranging from moderately positive to highly negative, and (5) low awareness of available help. Lower CMHL was associated with lower parental education level, being a father and less acculturated ethnic minorities, while higher CMHL was linked with previous service use. Help-seekers tended to have higher CMHL than non-help-seekers. Thus, disparities in parental CMHL may contribute to unequal access to mental health services. A more holistic, strengths-based and prevention-focused approach to CMHL in future research and measurement would inform intervention. Public health campaigns and targeted coproduced interventions to enhance the CMHL levels of parents with young children should form a key strategy for the promotion of child wellbeing.

TI  - Parental understanding of mental health in young children: The development and initial validation of the parental child mental health literacy questionnaire
T2  - MENTAL HEALTH & PREVENTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims: Parental understanding of mental health difficulties in young children is crucial for early intervention and support, yet child mental health is often misconceived and stigmatized. The Parental Child Mental Health Literacy Questionnaire (PCMHLQ) was developed to measure parents' literacy of child mental health and piloted in a general community sample of parents in the UK. Subjects and methods: The measure was developed in a three-stage process and piloted in 211 parents of children aged 4 - 11 years. Factor structure, convergent validity, and construct validity were assessed. Results: The final 23-item version produced a five-factor model corresponding to (1) beliefs, (2) fear of stigma or shame, (3) help-seeking confidence, (4) recognition, and (5) knowledge related to young children's mental health. Four factors had acceptable to high internal reliability. Total PCMHLQ was associated with adult mental health literacy and physical health literacy scores. PCMHLQ scores were lower for parents with a child with mental health difficulties, parents with current mental health difficulties, fathers, and low-income parents. Non- White ethnic minority parents held more negative child mental health beliefs, but did not differ in other scales, and parents who had a history of mental health service access had higher recognition but lower help-seeking confidence. Conclusion: This paper describes the first integrated measure of parental literacy in young children's mental health. Preliminary evidence suggests that the 23-item PCMHLQ has the potential to identify parents with low understanding and to inform tailored community-based interventions and public health initiatives.

TI  - Temporal dynamics of mindfulness meditation on adolescent attention: A longitudinal study
T2  - CURRENT PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mindfulness has been widely shown to enhance attention, yet its effects on different attentional functions and the required intervention duration remain inconsistent. Precise findings regarding attentional improvements can inform targeted interventions for specific ADHD subtypes. This study investigated the temporal progression of improvements in attentional functions during mindfulness interventions using a longitudinal design. A total of 116 participants were randomly assigned to three groups: mindfulness meditation (n = 39), music relaxation (n = 39), and mental health education (n = 38). Ultimately, 90 participants (30 per group) completed the study. Baseline data were collected through demographic questionnaires, the Toronto Mindfulness Scale (TMS), a psychological distress questionnaire, and the Attention Network Test (ANT). During the five-week intervention, participants practiced their assigned activities for 10 min daily (excluding weekends) and completed state mindfulness assessments and ANT testing at weeks 1, 3, and 5. After controlling for baseline measures, no significant linear increase in state mindfulness was found across the groups. However, the mindfulness group demonstrated significant and sustained improvements in executive control from the first week onward, outperforming the control groups. In contrast, no significant changes were observed in alerting or orienting functions throughout the intervention. These findings suggest that mindfulness primarily enhances executive control, while its effects on alerting and orienting functions remain unclear and warrant further investigation.

TI  - Evaluation of psychological training for nurses and midwives to optimise care for women with perinatal depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - MIDWIFERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective Perinatal depression is linked to poor maternal health and infant development outcomes. The World Health Organization recommends expanding the mental health education and training of primary care providers to improve the quality of perinatal depression care. The present study evaluated the effect of various psychological training methods on nurses' and midwives' competence in administering care to and alleviating symptoms in patients with perinatal depression. Methods A comprehensive search of the PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases was performed. The data were independently extracted by two reviewers, and the critical appraisal tools of the Joanna Briggs Institute were used for quality assessment. Random-effects meta-analysis was conducted using Review Manager 5.4 software. Findings A total of 13 articles including 246 nurses and midwives and 4,381 perinatal women were reviewed. Care administered through both face-to-face (relative risk [RR] 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61-0.74) and digital training (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26-0.74) significantly mitigated symptoms of perinatal depression. Significant benefits were observed after 3-to 5-day and 8-day training, for which the RR were 0.75 (95% CI 0.59-0.97) and 0.72 (95% CI 0.66-0.85), respectively. Studies with high intervention fidelity more effectively reduced the risk of depressive symptoms in perinatal women than those with low intervention fidelity. Key conclusions and implications for practice Compared with face-to-face, digital training methods were more effective in reducing the risk of depressive symptoms. High intervention fidelity and 3-to 5-day and 8-day training resulted in better outcomes. The present findings can serve as a reference for the design of psychological training programs for nurses and midwives to equip them with effective strategies for administering care to patients with perinatal depression.

TI  - A qualitative process evaluation of group problem management plus for distressed Syrian refugees in Türkiye
T2  - CAMBRIDGE PRISMS-GLOBAL MENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Syrian refugees in T & uuml;rkiye show a high prevalence of mental health problems but encounter barriers to accessing mental health services. Group Problem Management Plus (gPM+), developed by the World Health Organization, is a low-intensity psychological intervention delivered by nonspecialist facilitators. This qualitative process evaluation explores the acceptability, feasibility and perceived effectiveness of gPM+ for Syrian refugees resettled in T & uuml;rkiye, as well as facilitating factors and barriers to its implementation. Twenty-three semi-structured interviews were conducted with gPM+ participants, facilitators, drop-outs, relatives of participants and key informants. Findings showed that gPM+ was well-received for its group-based format, which participants felt fostered social support, and for its content, which they reported may have led to improvements in coping skills and family relationships. Facilitators viewed the intervention as feasible to implement. However, barriers such as participants' economic struggles, practical challenges (e.g., childcare and transportation difficulties) and low mental health literacy impeded engagement. Adapting gPM+ to address social determinants like poverty may be beneficial. The need for booster sessions was emphasized to maintain long-term change and provide deeper learning of the strategies. For sustainable scaling up gPM+ within primary health care, key informants highlighted the importance of training and supervising nonprofessional facilitators and securing governmental support.

TI  - WeARTolerance: Evaluating the impact of an arts-based program to reduce mental health-related stigma in young people
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The stigma surrounding mental health remains a significant barrier to help-seeking and well-being in youth populations. The invisibility of mental health issues highlights the critical need for improved knowledge and stigma reduction, underscoring the urgency of tackling this issue. Arts-based interventions have shown promise in addressing stigma, yet comprehensive longitudinal studies in community settings are limited. This research evaluates the "WeARTolerance'' arts-based program in reducing mental health stigma among diverse youths. The program integrated psychoeducational and creative activities (e.g., visual arts, cinema, music, and theatre) to explore mental health themes, with 125 teenagers and young adult participants (M = 13.70; SD = 2.06). The present mixed-method study was split into two phases with complementary objectives: 1) evaluate quantitatively the program's impact in reducing social stigma and related outcomes; 2) explore in-depth qualitative feedback about the program. For the first phase, reliable self-report questionnaires were used to measure mental health knowledge, social stigma, intergroup anxiety, and social distance in pre-, post-, and 6-month follow-up periods. Participants' age and past psychiatric issues were fixed factors with random intercepts, and mixed effects models were used to analyze the attitudinal outcomes across time. In the second phase of this validation, nine teenagers aged between 12 and 16 participated in two focus groups conducted three months after the program. Its contents underwent thorough analysis using content analysis techniques. The quantitative results from Phase 1 demonstrated a decreasing trend in all primary outcomes. In phase 2, participants acknowledged the activities' relevance, reported overall satisfaction with the program, and showed great enthusiasm and willingness to learn more. Arts-based interventions like "WeARTolerance" are valuable for challenging stigma and fostering understanding in youth populations and provide an alternative and creative way to increase mental health literacy. The study proposes a program to reduce youth mental health stigma through arts-based elements, early intervention, and psychoeducation, involving collaborations between professionals and artists to promote youth engagement. Future studies should include indirect social contact and randomized controlled interventions.

TI  - A Follow-Up of Undergraduate Students Five Years After Helping Skills Training
T2  - JOURNAL OF COUNSELING PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In a 5-year follow-up assessment, 33 students who had taken an undergraduate helping skills course indicated that they had continued to use the helping skills in both their professional lives and personal relationships. On average, there were no significant changes from pretraining to follow-up on empathy, natural helping ability, or facilitative interpersonal skills. Furthermore, although students had increased in self-efficacy for using the skills during training, on average they maintained their self-efficacy levels at the follow-up. The 15 participants who had further mental health education, however, scored higher at follow-up on empathy, natural helping ability, self-efficacy for using the skills, and facilitative interpersonal skills compared with the 18 participants who had no further mental health education (controlling for pretraining levels), suggesting that continued exposure to and practice using the skills helped them continue to improve their helping abilities. Qualitative data indicated that participants typically had positive experiences in the helping skills course. Implications for training and research are provided.

TI  - Navigating the Maze: Caregiver Perspectives on Pathways to Mental Health Care for US Youth at Clinical High Risk for Psychosis
T2  - EARLY INTERVENTION IN PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Treatment for youth who are at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR-P) presents an opportunity for early intervention with the capacity to decrease the burden associated with a potential psychotic disorder later in life. However, significant barriers prevent youth at CHR-P from accessing speciality mental health services. Few studies have examined the pathways to care for youth at CHR-P within the U.S. health system. Methods The present study reports the results of a codebook thematic analysis of qualitative interviews conducted with caregivers (primarily parents) of 15 youth (ages 12-25 years) who entered a CHR-P speciality program. Using a semi-structured interview, we inquired about their experiences navigating the health system to eventually arrive at the speciality program, including help-seeking events and referrals, caregivers' attributions for youths' CHR-P symptoms, and barriers and facilitators to care. Results Caregivers reported confusion and uncertainty regarding the causes of symptoms. They also disclosed the significant challenges to obtaining mental health care, including low mental health literacy, illness stigma, provider unavailability or appropriateness and adequacy of referrals. Most of the youth had encounters with emergency services during their help-seeking journey. Conclusion Our results help define targets for future policy, research and clinical efforts to improve access to speciality care for youth at CHR-P in the U.S.

TI  - Mental health literacy of undergraduate radiography students in Zimbabwe
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL IMAGING AND RADIATION SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Assessing the Mental Health Literacy (MHL) of stu-dents is crucial in having an understanding of mental health knowl-edge gaps, stigma, wrong beliefs, risk factors, and treatment-seeking behaviour. The aim of this study was to use a validated scale to ex-amine the MHL of radiography students at a tertiary institution in Harare, Zimbabwe. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive survey was conducted to assess the MHL of radiography students at a tertiary institution in Harare, Zimbabwe, using a validated MHL scale. Individual t-tests and analy-sis of variance (ANOVA) tests were conducted for each variable to ex-amine the differences between groups expected to differ in their MHL. Results: A total of 89 students were enrolled into the study. The over-all mean MHL score was 96.62 ( SD-9.55), with students less knowl-edgeable on environmental, social, familial, or biological factors that increase the risk of developing a mental illness. Gender had no statis-tically significant effect on the overall score, t(83) =-0.81, p = 0.42 [Males had mean score = 95.64, SD = 10.14; and Females had mean score = 97.35, SD = 9.12]] . However, there was a significant differ-ence in recognition of disorders by gender, t (83) =-2.42, p = 0.02, with female students ( M = 26.24, SD = 2.68) scoring higher than male students ( M = 24.69, SD = 3.21 ). In addition, students with a previous history of mental health disorders scored higher ( M = 26.86, SD = 2.19 ) than those with no previous history (M = 25.47, SD = 3.04) , however the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusion: The students in the current study demonstrated lower MHL compared to most studies in the literature. Students were less knowledgeable about environmental, social, familial, or biological fac-tors that increase the risk of developing a mental illness. Furthermore, a correlation between MHL and mental health experience was demon-strated. The implication of these findings is that the curriculum ought to be developed to help undergraduate radiography students become more knowledgeable about mental health and comfortable seeking ap-propriate support

TI  - Exploring mental health literacy and formal and informal help-seeking intentions among Palestinian adolescents in Israel: insights from the MHLS-Arabic-adolescents tool
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Mental health literacy (MHL) is a crucial concept in mental health because it promotes positive mental health outcomes and behaviors across various demographics, including adolescents.Aims This study utilized the MHLS-Arabic-Adolescents tool to investigate MHL among Palestinian adolescents in Israel, aiming to explore its significance in determining intentions to seek formal and informal mental health help separately.Methods A cohort of 172 adolescents (with a mean age of 16.25 +/- 1.25 years, comprising 64% females) completed assessments measuring their intention for both formal and informal help-seeking, levels of psychological distress, MHL, and various sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. This study uses the same dataset from previous research on formal help-seeking, with an expanded focus on informal help-seeking and MHL using an adapted tool.Results Participants reported medium to high levels of MHL factors, demonstrating stronger intentions to seek informal help compared to formal. "Knowledge of where to seek information" and "Attitude toward mental illness" emerged as the significant MHL factors determining formal help-seeking intentions, whereas 'attitudes toward mental illness' was identified as the sole determinant of intentions to seek informal help.Conclusions This study highlights the importance of MHL factors in shaping adolescents' intentions to seek formal and informal mental health help. It emphasizes the need to strengthen informal support networks, improve adolescents' attitudes toward mental illness, and facilitate access to mental health information. These insights offer valuable guidance for intervention programs aimed at promoting both formal and informal help-seeking behaviors among Palestinian Arab adolescents in Israel and similar groups.

TI  - Increased belongingness as a mechanism of change of school-based programs mitigating suicidal ideation among adolescents
T2  - EUROPEAN CHILD & ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents, highlighting the importance of early intervention in school settings. Universal mental health awareness programs, aimed at improving mental health literacy and help-seeking behaviors, are a key preventive approach. This study examined whether changes in thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness-two constructs from the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (IPTS)-mediate the effects of school-based mental health interventions on suicidal ideation (SI). A total of 436 adolescents from central Israel (154 boys, 279 girls; M = 14.6, SD = 1.1) were randomly assigned to either a mental health awareness intervention (N = 256) or a minimal-intervention control group with attendance monitoring (N = 180). Belongingness, burdensomeness, and SI were assessed at baseline, 1-month, and 1-year post-intervention. Regression analyses showed that lower belongingness (beta = -0.25, p < .001) and higher burdensomeness (beta = 0.21, p < .01) predicted higher SI at 1-month, while only belongingness remained significant at 1-year (beta = -0.19, p < .01). The mental health awareness intervention increased school-specific belongingness (beta = 0.22, p < .001), whereas attendance monitoring intervention increased general belongingness (beta = 0.18, p < .01). Mediation analysis indicated that the effects of the intervention type on SI were not significantly mediated by general and school belongingness. These findings suggest that promoting broader social connectedness beyond school environments may support reductions in adolescent suicide risk over time.

TI  - The Web's Potential to Provide Depression Literacy Resources to Latinx Teens: A Missed Opportunity?
T2  - HOWARD JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Among U.S. adolescents, Latinxs have the highest levels of depression and the lowest access to treatment. Educational resources on the World Wide Web have potential to redress disparities by improving mental health literacy, but little is known about the availability and quality of web documents about depression targeting Latinx teens. We conducted a qualitative content analysis of search-engine results to inform future research. Of the 330 results, the majority (48%) were news stories, most with breaking news in Spanish about youth suicides. Only two documents targeted Latinx youth, including one that was depression-specific. A critique of this document revealed that although it met some indicators of web-resource quality, it did not meet its potential to empower Latinx teens to raise their depression literacy. We argue that such scarcity is an access barrier to preventive care and contributes to existing disparities. We highlight the need for web documents aiming to enhance depression literacy among Latinx teens that are both easily discoverable as well as socio-politically and culturally tailored.

TI  - Evaluating suicide attitudes and suicide literacy in adolescents
T2  - JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundTwo of the most common modifiable barriers to help-seeking for mental health problems during adolescence are stigma and poor mental health literacy. However, relatively little is known about stigma as it relates to suicide, and knowledge about suicidality in this age group.AimsTo assess levels of suicide literacy and suicide attitudes in an adolescent sample, and to identify correlates of these constructs.MethodsData were drawn from the pre-intervention survey of the Sources of Strength Australia Project. A total of 1019 adolescents aged between 11 and 17 years participated. Suicide literacy and attitudes were measured alongside potential correlates including psychological distress, suicidal ideation, mastery, previous exposure to suicidal thinking and behaviour, and demographics.ResultsParticipants more strongly endorsed attitudes attributing suicide to isolation/depression, compared to attitudes glorifying or stigmatising suicide. Gaps in knowledge about suicide included the risk factors, signs and symptoms. Key correlates of suicide attitudes and literacy included age, gender and cultural background.ConclusionFindings highlight the need for further education activities in schools and public awareness campaigns that address the gaps in suicide knowledge and attitudes. Such activities would assist in the identification of suicide risk among young people and improve help-seeking in this population.

TI  - Health Promotion and Wellness for All Students: School-Based Occupational Therapy as a Preventive Approach
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic accelerated the impending youth mental health crisis in the United States, necessitating a comprehensive approach to providing mental health education and interventions. School-based occupational therapy practitioners' scope of practice includes wellness promotion, early detection, and evidence -based interventions for mental health challenges. Given the rise of school-based wellness programs, the growing legislation supporting the formation of such programs, and the burgeoning burden of pediatric mental health concerns, occupational therapy practitioners are uniquely positioned to create and implement interventions to support student access to the general education curriculum and can do so by using both prepandemic funding sources and pandemic response funds. This Health Policy Perspectives column is a call to action to refocus the occupational therapy practitioner's role in school settings to include providing high-quality, evidence-based preventive mental health education and interventions. In this column, we examine prevention-based occupational therapy services in Mason City Schools, Mason, Ohio, as a model of success in the execution of this vision for school-based practice. In addition, we outline the importance of expanding the role of occupational therapy practitioners in schools, which will in turn increase the visibility and relevancy of the profession and broaden its impact on mitigating the youth mental health crisis.

TI  - Intervention Effect of Mindfulness-Based Mental Health Education Therapy on Adolescents Mobile Phone Addiction and Cognitive Tendency
T2  - IRANIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Teenagers are more prone to mobile phone addiction than other age groups due to their lack of self-control. This addiction to mobile phones severely affects their physical and mental health, causing irreversible harm as they grow older. As such, exploring suitable psychotherapy for their physical and mental development needs is essential, in ways that effectively change teenagers' mobile phone addictive behaviors.Methods: An experimental study was conducted on 910 teenage volunteers recruited from 5 communities in Gansu, Hebei, and Liaoning Provinces in China from May to July 2023. The participants were screened using the Mobile Phone Addiction Index Scale (MPAI). On the basis of the evaluation results, 56 individuals were selected based on the evaluation results and randomly divided into experimental and control groups, each comprising 28 individuals. The experimental group underwent an 8-week mindfulness-based mental health education therapy. Both groups were measured before and after the intervention.Results: The mobile phone addiction score of the experimental group was significantly lower than that of the control group (P<0.001). The cognitive tendency score and mental wellbeing score of the experimental group was significantly higher than those of the control group (P<0.001).Conclusion: Mindfulness-based mental health education therapy effectively alleviates teenagers' mobile phone addiction and improves their cognitive tendencies and mental health. This approach serves as a valuable reference for effectively preventing and managing mobile phone addiction among teenagers.

TI  - Mental health literacy amongst children with common mental health problems and their parents in Java, Indonesia: a qualitative study
T2  - GLOBAL MENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Optimising mental health literacy (MHL) at the individual and population level can be an effective mental health improvement and prevention tool. However, concepts of MHL are largely based on evidence from high-income countries. Little is known about the manifestation and role of MHL in countries where collectivist health and social cultures are dominant.Aim. This study aimed to examine the MHL of Indonesian children and young people (CYP) with experience of common mental health problems and their parents.Methods. Semi-structured interviews with 40 participants (19 CYP aged 11-15 with experience of common mental health problems and 21 parents) from three areas of Java, Indonesia. Data were analysed using framework analysis, informed by Jorm's 1997 Mental Health Literacy Framework.Results. Parents and CYP demonstrated relatively low levels of MHL defined from a conventional perspective. Religiosity and spirituality were salient in participants' accounts, particularly parents, as were narratives about personal responsibility. These beliefs appeared to contribute to a high level of self-blame for mental illness, self-reliance for symptom management, the foregrounding of support from spiritual/traditional healers and a reduced propensity to access professional help. CYP were heavily reliant on family support, but parents often felt they were not best placed to communicate with their children about mental health. Providing trusted, technology-based sources of mental health information were advocated by CYP.Conclusion. Robust efforts are needed to improve MHL in low- and middle-income countries drawing on culturally appropriate approaches to reduce stigma and optimise timely, effective help-seeking for CYP. Enhancing parental and family level literacy may be efficacious, especially when combined with mechanisms to facilitate open communication, as may the development of standalone interventions directly developed to reach younger generations. Future research may usefully establish the comparative efficacy and acceptability of these different approaches.

TI  - Mental health in nursing education: perspectives of learning facilitators and students in South Africa
T2  - BMC NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIntegrating mental health education into undergraduate nursing curricula is essential for equipping primary health care nurses to effectively address mental health challenges. Despite the growing burden of mental health disorders in South Africa, nursing graduates often lack sufficient mental health training, limiting their ability to provide holistic care. This study investigated the perspectives of nurse educators and preceptors and nursing students on the integration of mental health in nursing education.MethodsAn exploratory case study design was employed. Data were collected through individual interviews guided by a structured interview schedule. Participants - comprising purposefully selected nurse educators, nurse preceptors, and undergraduate nursing students - were drawn from a South African nursing education institution. Data collection occurred between October and November 2023. Thematic analysis was conducted to distil key perspectives from the interviews.ResultsThree central themes emerged: The first theme was "curriculum and teaching challenges"- Educators faced difficulties in bridging theory and practice due to limited hands-on training opportunities. While innovative teaching methods had previously enhanced learning, ethical and emotional concerns arose when students shared subjective experiences. The second theme was "students' attitudes and preparedness"- Initially, students exhibited indifference toward mental health care, but clinical exposure gradually shifted their perceptions. However, emotional unpreparedness and fear of psychiatric settings hindered their learning experiences. The third theme was "suggestions for strengthening mental health care integration"- Participants advocated for enriched theoretical content, increased clinical hours, early and continuous exposure to mental health care, structured emotional debriefing sessions, and short courses aimed at enhancing practical competence and student support.ConclusionThis study highlights the disparity between ideal mental health education and the reality within South African undergraduate nursing curricula. Educators, preceptors, and students emphasised the need for comprehensive training reforms, including early exposure, extended practical hours, structured emotional support, and mentorship. Such measures could foster a more realistic approach to mental health nursing and better prepare graduates to deliver integrated mental health care within primary health care settings.Clinical trial numberNot applicable.

TI  - Potential harm from universal school-based mental health interventions: Candidate mechanisms and future directions
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Universal school-based mental health interventions involve lessons delivered to whole classes of young people irrespective of need, with the overall aim of improving mental health literacy, preventing mental health problems and/or reducing those that have already started. A number of high-quality trials show that universal interventions can have a range of negative effects, with participants in the intervention group experiencing worsening mental health or other negative outcomes. In this review, we summarise what we know so far about these negative effects, which we refer to as 'potential harm'. Two important questions remain poorly understood. First, the mechanisms driving potential harm are unknown, including whether negative effects are driven by reporting phenomena, the content of the intervention itself, or both. Second, individual differences in susceptibility to these effects is unclear. In the second half of the paper, we explore whether further universal trials should be run and argue that, if they are, the crucial issue of negative effects must be considered at all stages. In particular, we recommend that trials be designed in such a way to test mechanisms and individual differences in response. Information can then be provided to schools and policymakers about why young people might respond in different ways to an intervention, and how to support vulnerable students. Ultimately, this will lead to more effective and less harmful interventions for everyone.

TI  - High School Students' Depression Literacy about Interventions and Prevention: A Survey in Tehran.
T2  - Depression research and treatment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background: Given the high prevalence of depressive disorders in the present world and the lack of adequate awareness about prevention and appropriate interventions, increasing mental health literacy is vital for promoting mental health to reduce depression and its consequences.Methods: In this descriptive cross-sectional study, participants were recruited among the second high school students in the 2018-2019 academic year. The sample size was 2038, and samples were selected by multistage cluster sampling from different areas of Tehran. Demographic variables like age, gender, level of education, and parents' characteristics and mental health literacy questions in treatment and prevention areas were evaluated.Results: Analyses showed that of high school students, 83% considered getting help from psychiatrists and 80% considered learning stress management as the best preventive measures, while as the best treatment measures, 79.5% considered counseling the best place to refer for visiting a professional and 45% selected general counseling centers.Conclusion: The study results showed that high school students have a positive attitude toward preventing and treating depressive disorders, getting help from specialists, and useful measures for depressed people. But they did not know enough about preventive measures, including learning effective coping skills, reading self-help books, and continuing to take psychiatric medications. Planning and providing the necessary training are important, especially for high school students.

TI  - Project Chill: Program Description and Session Feedback Data From a Proof-of-Concept Study of a School-Based Psychoeducational Program Using Creative Media
T2  - COGNITIVE AND BEHAVIORAL PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Anxiety disorders in youth are pervasive and impairing. Further, too few young people are identified and treated due to the barriers in accessing mental health treatment (fees, transportation, and time). School-based prevention initiatives may represent viable options for these vulnerable youngsters. Therefore, this proof-of-concept study assessed the feasibility, acceptability, and benefits of a brief prevention program for seventh and eighth grade students. Forty-two seventh and eighth grade students completed a 5-session psychoeducational program using creative media including short video clips, music, and karaoke. Session feedback forms were completed by all students after each class. The results revealed that the program was perceived as moderately helpful yet was quite feasible and acceptable. Further, the majority of students accurately recalled key lessons from every lesson, suggesting high levels of engagement and integrity of session content. The implications of these findings for future program development and evaluation are discussed.

TI  - Evaluation of an Online-Based Self-Help Program for Patients With Panic Disorder: Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Panic disorder is an anxiety disorder marked by severe fear of panic attacks in the absence of causes. Agoraphobia is a related anxiety disorder, which involves fear and avoidance of specific situations in which escape or help may be difficult. Both can be debilitating and impair well-being. Onetreatment option may be internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT), which allows large-scale application and may overcome treatment barriers for some individuals. Objective: This study aimed to evaluated the effectiveness of a novel online self-help intervention for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. As our primary hypotheses, we expected the intervention to improve panic and agoraphobia symptoms and well-being. Our secondary hypotheses entailed improvements in daily functioning, mental health literacy, working ability, and health care use in the intervention group. Methods: German-speaking patients (N=156) aged 18-65 years with internet access and a diagnosis of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia were recruited for this randomized controlled trial. The intervention group (n=82) received access to a 12-week online self-help program entailing psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring, exposure, and mindfulness elements. The control group (n=72) received care as usual during the study period and was offered the prospect of using the program after 12 weeks. The primary outcomes were assessed via the Panic and Agoraphobia Scale (PAS) and the WHO (World Health Organization)-5 Well-Being Index (WHO-5). Mixed effect models were computed using multivariate imputation by chained equation for the analysis of intervention effects. Results: In the intervention group, participants completed on average 7.3 out of 12 (60.8%) modules, and 27 out of 82 (32.1%) participants finished the whole course. Changes in PAS revealed a significant effect in favor of the intervention group (t(110.1)=-2.22, P-adj=.03) with a small to moderate effect size (d=-0.37, 95% CI-0.70 to-0.04). No significant effect was found for the second primary outcome WHO-5 (t(149.8)=1.35, P-adj=.09) or the secondary outcomes. Improvements were observed in anxiety (t(206.8)=-4.12; P<.001; Cohen d=-0.60, 95%CI-0.089 to-0.32) and depression (t(257.4)=-3.20; P<.001; Cohen d=-0.4195%CI-0.66to-0.16). No negative effects were associated with the intervention (t(125)=-1.14, P=.26). Conclusions: The presented online intervention can help reduce the core symptomatology of panic disorder and agoraphobia, as well as anxiety symptoms and associated depression. No effects were found for well-being and secondary outcomes. This may be due to higher illness burden in the intervention group and possibly the COVID pandemic, which caused unique challenges to patients suffering from panic disorder. Therefore, further research and intervention adaptations may be warranted to improve these outcomes.

TI  - The Promoting Effect of Mental Health Education on Students' Social Adaptability: Implications for Environmental
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Students' mental health has always been a hot topic in colleges and universities. How to make students integrate into the collective and society faster and better is also one of the most difficult problems for educators. Students want to improve their competitiveness; not only must they have superb professional skills, but at the same time, they must have good social adaptability. Only in this way can they quickly complete their identity change and quickly adapt to workplace life. Students' social adaptability is not innate, but gradually formed through long-term positive mental health education. Considering the relationship between psychoeducation and social adaptability, in general, a good psychoeducation system is conducive to the development of students' social adaptability, and they promote each other. Good mental health education is multifaceted and sustainable for the development of social adaptability. In this context, it is necessary to formulate a targeted positive mental health education plan according to the actual situation of students, so as to comprehensively improve the comprehensive quality of students in this way.

AB  - Mental Health Literacy (MHL) is a multidimensional aspect that addresses barriers to seeking professional help. Strong MHL enables individuals to identify mental health challenges and seek professional support if required. Although its importance is widely recognized, there is a significant gap in the design of targeted interventions considering modifiable factors. This study offered a decision support framework that assessed multiple dimensions of MHL and segmented individuals within academic communities based on modifiable predictors that can be amenable to change through educational interventions. The user study was conducted using a cross-sectional survey of 385 participants, representing diverse academic roles. Five latent profiles were identified, each reflecting distinct configurations of help-seeking attitude, knowledge, and beliefs related to mental illness using Latent Profile Analysis. The study compared decision tree classifiers (C5.0, CART, and Conditional Inference Trees) to generate decision rules tailored to each profile, ensuring interpretability and practical utility. Interactions between MHL profiles and demographic variables are visualized through an interactive POWER BI dashboard. This framework provides actionable insights to policymakers and health professionals for targeted resource allocation, precise intervention design, and longitudinal tracking of profile evaluation, thereby enhancing institutional mental healthcare.

TI  - Development and acceptability testing of a mental health promotion intervention using the Medical Research Council framework
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH PROMOTION AND EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Young people are at a high risk of developing mental health disorders or illnesses. Mental health promotion (MHP) interventions can reduce this risk. Using the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for the development and evaluation of complex interventions, this study designed and acceptability tested a methodologically robust school-based mental health promotion intervention. A scoping review and focus groups with stakeholders were conducted during the development phase of the MRC framework. The scoping review involved identifying evidence for effective school-based MHP interventions. Focus groups were then used to determine the acceptability of components identified by the scoping review and to clarify the target or goal of taking part in the intervention. A logic model, showing the theory of change underpinning an intervention designed on the basis of this development phase, was subsequently developed. The scoping review established that MHP interventions typically focus on stigma and stereotypes, mental health literacy and knowledge and help-seeking, and use these foci to determine impact. Common intervention components include group discussion, videos, presentations, storytelling and handouts. Testing of these commonly occurring components targeting knowledge and attitudes towards mental health and stigma and stereotypes suggested all were acceptable to stakeholders. Using the MRC framework to guide the development and test the acceptability of a MHP intervention, this study has produced a complex evidence-based health promotion intervention using interactive activities and videos. Further phases will involve a process evaluation of the intervention fidelity and feasibility testing.

TI  - Effectiveness of an internet-based intervention to improve sleep difficulties in a culturally diverse sample of international students: A randomised controlled pilot study
T2  - JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Sleep difficulties are widespread among international students. Internet-based interventions are suggested as a low-threshold treatment option but may require cultural adaptation among culturally diverse populations. The present pilot study investigated the effectiveness and acceptance of an internet-based intervention to improve sleep difficulties in international students. A total of 81 international students of 36 nationalities were randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 41) or waitlist control group (n = 40). The intervention group received immediate access to a culturally non-adapted unguided internet-based sleep intervention consisting of three modules based on sleep hygiene and cognitive techniques to reduce rumination. At baseline, 4 and 12 weeks after randomisation, insomnia severity, measured by the Insomnia Severity Index, and secondary outcomes (sleep quality, depression, anxiety, perceived stress, well-being, presenteeism, mental health literacy) were assessed. Data were analysed using linear multi-level analyses. Additionally, satisfaction and perceived cultural appropriateness of the intervention were evaluated by international students after 4 weeks, and compared with ratings of German students, who represent the original target group. Insomnia severity improved over time in the intervention group compared to the control group, revealing a significant estimated mean difference of -5.60 (Hedges' g = 0.84, p < 0.001) after 12 weeks. Satisfaction and perceived cultural appropriateness was high and comparable to that of German students. The present study shows that a culturally non-adapted internet-based sleep intervention can be a low-threshold treatment option to help meet the high demand for mental healthcare among international students. It thus indicates that cultural adaptation might not represent a precondition for providing effective internet-based sleep interventions to this target group.

TI  - A Rapid Review of Mental Health Training Programs for School Nurses
T2  - JOURNAL OF SCHOOL NURSING
M3  - Review
AB  - There is an urgent need for improved school-based mental health services to address students' increasing mental health needs. School nurses are often at the frontlines of youth mental health, but report feeling unprepared to manage student needs due to limited training. We conducted a rapid review to identify evidence-based mental health educational interventions for school nurses and evaluate program characteristics. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. While the literature evaluating mental health training programs for school nurses is limited, it suggests that training may improve school nurse knowledge, confidence, and preparedness to address student mental health needs and improve the management of student mental health. Additionally, it highlighted the importance of support, resources, and policies that foster mental health promotion. Future research should focus on obtaining a current assessment of school nurse mental health education needs, evaluating existing interventions, and developing more evidence-based mental health training programs for school nurses.

TI  - An integrative review of parent education approaches in sport: Considerations for program planning and evaluation
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINE & SCIENCE IN SPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - In recent years, there has been an increase in the delivery and evaluation of parent education programs within youth sport. Subsequently, some recent reviews of these programs have been conducted. However, one consistent issue across many of the programs and associated review papers is the lack of an appropriate evaluation framework to guide the planning or associated reporting of the outcomes of the interventions. This has limited understanding of the overall impact of sport parenting interventions. Thus, the purposes of the current study were as follows: (a) to identify commonalities in the reporting and evaluation of parent education programs; (b) to identify gaps in the reporting and evaluation of parent education programs; (c) to draw these insights together to provide suggestions regarding how the RE-AIM could be used to enhance planning and evaluation of evidence-based programs for parent education in sport. Specifically, utilizing the RE-AIM framework to provide insights into pertinent evaluation metrics, this integrative review aimed to identify commonalities and gaps in the reporting of parent education programs. The RE-AIM framework considers the essential elements to assess the external and internal validity of interventions through five dimensions: Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (Am J Public Health. 1999;89(9):1322-1327). Subsequently, the review aimed to provide suggestions regarding strategies to enhance the planning and evaluation of evidence-based programs for parent education in sport. Overall, the analysis demonstrated that most studies presented some pertinent evaluation information related to the RE-AIM framework, such as the number of participants and contacts made, the measures used, and the program level. However, the studies also lacked information on participant exclusion criteria, the method used to select the delivery agent (e.g., parents engaged in the program), and cost measures. Overall, the current study identified various areas where programs could be enhanced, specifically related to reporting procedural elements (e.g., program design, target population, and costs) pertaining to the implementation of parent education programs.

TI  - A Feasibility and Pilot Trial of the Brief Educational Guide for Individuals in Need (BEGIN): Psychoeducation for Individuals at Risk for Psychosis
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES
M3  - Article
AB  - Individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR) report a strong desire for psychoeducation, and clinical guidelines recommend psychoeducation in early psychosis care. Although several CHR psychoeducation models have been developed, additional research is needed to establish the effectiveness of these models. The goal of this study was to conduct a pilot trial of the Brief Educational Guide for Individuals in Need (BEGIN). BEGIN is a brief structured psychoeducation intervention designed to educate CHR individuals on symptoms and treatment options. We conducted a feasibility and pilot study of 25 CHR individuals (60% female, M-age = 20.6, 64% non-White, 52% Hispanic/Latino) identified via the Structured Interview for Psychosis Risk Syndromes. Qualitative interviews were administered to learn about their experience and analyzed using iterative thematic analysis. Participants (n = 12) completed pre- and post-BEGIN self-report measures to assess factors that influence treatment engagement, including CHR knowledge and motivation for therapy. Data were analyzed using Hedges' g effect sizes and paired samples t tests. The intervention completion rate (83%) and therapeutic alliance were high. Qualitative themes and quantitative measures converged on similar results showing how CHR individuals were impacted by receiving psychoeducation via BEGIN, including increased CHR knowledge (g = 1.37), competence to monitor symptoms (g = 0.53), hope (g = 0.87), and motivation for therapy (g = 0.46). This study demonstrated the feasibility, acceptability, and potential benefits of the BEGIN CHR psychoeducation model, including enhancing motivation for treatment. The flexible but standardized format can facilitate BEGIN's implementation and dissemination.

TI  - Strategies to Safeguard Mental Health Among Medical and Allied Health Trainees: A Narrative Review
T2  - ADVANCES IN MEDICAL EDUCATION AND PRACTICE
M3  - Review
AB  - Medical and allied health training programs are inherently demanding, often compromising trainees' mental health through prolonged workloads, emotional exhaustion, and systemic pressures. This narrative review explores evidence-based strategies and institutional frameworks aimed at safeguarding mental health among medical and allied health trainees. The review seeks to identify effective interventions that balance professional rigor with psychological well-being. A targeted literature search of PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar (2000-2025) was conducted using keywords such as mental health, burnout, medical education, wellness, and resilience. Eligible publications addressing psychological stress, mental health interventions, and systemic reforms in trainee education were analyzed thematically to synthesize protective strategies and best practices. Findings reveal that mental health challenges-including anxiety, depression, and burnout-affect over one-third of health trainees globally. Protective measures identified include structured mentorship, mindfulness-based resilience programs, time management training, and confidential psychological support services. Institutional strategies such as curriculum flexibility, rest-hour regulations, and leadership-driven wellness policies were shown to reduce stress and improve academic satisfaction. The inclusion of peer support systems and integration of wellness education further enhance psychological safety and engagement. Safeguarding trainee mental health requires a balanced approach combining personal resilience-building with organizational reform. Embedding wellness curricula, promoting mental health literacy, and ensuring access to support systems can mitigate burnout and improve patient care outcomes. Future efforts should focus on implementing evidence-based mental health frameworks and fostering a culture of openness within training institutions.

TI  - Mental Health Literacy in Adults: Turkish Mothers' Knowledge of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
T2  - KINDHEIT UND ENTWICKLUNG
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - : Theoretical Background: Mental health literacy (MHL) is crucial for early detection and intervention of mental health disorders. Among parents, particularly mothers, MHL plays a vital role in recognizing symptoms in children. Cultural norms might influence mothers' ability to recognize and address mental health issues such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Although trauma (e. g., disasters, migration, domestic stressors) is a significant concern among children in Turkey, there is limited research on mothers' PTSD literacy, particularly how cultural values shape their MHL. Objective: This study aimed to explore the levels of MHL among Turkish mothers, specifically focusing on their ability to recognize PTSD symptoms. It also investigated the role of cultural factors on mothers' MHL. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 510 Turkish mothers (M_age = 42.5, SD = 6.65, with children aged 0 - 24 years). Participants were recruited via online parenting networks and completed a form including demographic information, a PTSD vignette, and the cultural values scale (honor, dignity, face) through an online survey. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistical techniques and logistic regression to identify factors associated with correct PTSD diagnosis. Results: The results showed that nearly 20 % of the mothers were able to correctly identify PTSD symptoms. Mothers who had lower adherence to face culture values (less concern about social approval), lived outside Turkey, worked in healthcare, were well-educated, and had younger children were more likely to correctly identify PTSD symptoms. Discussion and Conclusion: Findings highlight low MHL regarding PTSD among Turkish mothers and emphasize the influence of the cultural context. Specifically, strong emphasis on social-preserving group reputation in face cultures may hinder recognition of mental health problems. Culturally sensitive interventions are needed to improve mothers' MHL.Zusammenfassung: Theoretischer Hintergrund: Mental Health Literacy (MHL) ist entscheidend f & uuml;r die Fr & uuml;herkennung und Intervention bei psychischen St & ouml;rungen. Bei Eltern, insbesondere bei M & uuml;ttern, spielt MHL eine wichtige Rolle bei der Erkennung von Symptomen bei Kindern. Kulturelle Normen k & ouml;nnen die F & auml;higkeit von M & uuml;ttern beeinflussen, psychische Probleme wie posttraumatische Belastungsst & ouml;rungen (PTBS) zu erkennen. Obwohl Traumata (z. B. Katastrophen, Migration, h & auml;usliche Stressfaktoren) bei Kindern in der T & uuml;rkei ein bedeutendes Problem darstellen, gibt es nur wenige Untersuchungen & uuml;ber PTBS-Wissen von M & uuml;ttern, insbesondere dazu, wie kulturelle Werte ihre MHL beeinflussen. Ziel: Diese Studie zielt darauf ab, Mental Health Literacy bei t & uuml;rkischen M & uuml;ttern zu untersuchen, mit besonderem Schwerpunkt auf ihrer F & auml;higkeit, PTBS-Symptome zu erkennen. Au ss erdem wird die Rolle kultureller Faktoren f & uuml;r die MHL von M & uuml;ttern untersucht. Methode: Es wurde eine Querschnittsstudie mit 510 t & uuml;rkischen M & uuml;ttern mit Kindern im Alter von 0 bis 24 Jahren durchgef & uuml;hrt. Die Teilnehmerinnen wurden & uuml;ber Online-Elternnetzwerke rekrutiert und f & uuml;llten im Rahmen einer Online-Umfrage ein Formular mit demografischen Angaben, einer PTBS-Vignette und der Skala f & uuml;r kulturelle Werte (Ehre, W & uuml;rde, Ansehen) aus. Die Daten wurden mit deskriptiven statistischen Verfahren und logistischer Regression analysiert, um Faktoren zu identifizieren, die mit einer korrekten PTBS-Diagnose in Zusammenhang stehen. Ergebnisse: Die Ergebnisse zeigten, dass fast 20 % der M & uuml;tter in der Lage waren, PTBS-Symptome korrekt zu identifizieren. M & uuml;tter, die sich weniger an Werte einer ,,Gesichtswahrung" hielten (weniger Sorge um soziale Anerkennung), au ss erhalb der T & uuml;rkei lebten, im Gesundheitswesen arbeiteten, gut ausgebildet waren und j & uuml;ngere Kinder hatten, konnten PTBS-Symptome eher korrekt erkennen. Diskussion und Schlussfolgerung: Die Ergebnisse unterstreichen das geringe Gesundheitsbewusstsein in Bezug auf PTBS unter t & uuml;rkischen M & uuml;ttern und betonen den Einfluss des kulturellen Kontexts. Insbesondere die starke Betonung der Erhaltung des Ansehens in der Gruppe kann die Erkennung von psychischen Problemen behindern. Es sind kulturell sensible Ma ss nahmen erforderlich, um das Gesundheitsbewusstsein der M & uuml;tter zu verbessern.

AB  - Introduction: The existing literature is reviewed to determine the current state of knowledge about eating disorders (ED), prevention programs in relation to stigma-discrimination, help search, empowerment, emotional education, mental health literacy, and recommending future directions. Preventive interventions, necessary during adolescence and young adulthood, must be designed with the focus on reducing discrimination based on weight and the stigmatization of ED. With some gender specificities, with attention to stress and social isolation, social consensus, EDs in men; with work to reduce compliance with some norms of the male gender, as one of the targets in the development of prevention programs. And reduce teasing by peers and family, experiences of stigmatization with the family and at work, which predict greater internalization of prejudice due to weight (IPP). And carry out mental health literacy activities such as the Media Smart program, promote help seeking, empowerment as in the REBel program and improve emotional education, the management of negative emotions with activities for the improvement of emotions, in addition to the Body Project (cognitive dissonance).
AB  - Introduccion: Se revisa la bibliografia existente para determinar el estado actual del conocimiento acerca de los programas de prevencion de TCA en relacion con la estigmatizacion-discriminacion, la busqueda de ayuda, el empoderamiento, la educacion emocional, la alfabetizacion en salud mental y recomendar futuras direcciones. Hay que disenar intervenciones preventivas, necesarias durante la adolescencia y la edad adulta joven, con el foco en reducir la discriminacion basada en el peso y la estigmatizacion de los TCA. Con algunas especificidades por genero, con atencion al estres y el aislamiento social, el consenso social, los TCA en varones; con trabajo en disminuir la conformidad con algunas normas del genero masculino, como una de las dianas en el desarrollo de los programas de prevencion. Y disminuir las burlas por companeros y familia, las experiencias de estigmatizacion con la familia y en el trabajo, que predicen mayor internalizacion de prejuicio por el peso (IPP). Y realizar actividades de alfabetizacion de salud mental como el programa Media Smart, fomentar la busqueda de ayuda y el empoderamiento como en el programa REBel, y mejorar la educacion emocional y el manejo de las emociones negativas con actividades para la mejora de las emociones, adicionales al Body Project (disonancia cognitiva).

T2  - JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Adolescence is a period of developmental transition marked by a high prevalence of mental health challenges. The emergence of these challenges underscores the importance of encouraging help-seeking behaviors among adolescents to mitigate negative psychological outcomes. Gaining a deeper understanding of the lived experiences of adolescents can inform intervention development and increase access to care. Methods: This study draws on qualitative information collected from 71 focus group discussions across 13 countries with male and female adolescents aged 12-19 years old. Focus group discussions were transcribed verbatim and translated into English, with transcripts coded and analyzed for emergent themes. Focused data analysis centered on themes related to help-seeking strategies for mental health challenges as well as related barriers and facilitators. Results: Participants emphasized the critical role of informal support systems, including friends and family, in helping adolescents cope with mental health challenges. Additionally, participants highlighted the importance of accessing professional support through school or community mental health services. Significant barriers to help-seeking were described, including mental health stigma, restrictive gender norms, limited service availability, poor quality or unaffordable services, low mental health literacy, and unsupportive interpersonal relationships. Participants emphasized the role of digital technologies, school and community environments, and trustworthy relationships as facilitators of seeking help. Discussion: While many adolescents are aware of the importance of seeking help for mental health challenges, there is a need for country-level interventions to increase mental health literacy and reduce mental health stigma in order to ensure optimal access to care.

TI  - Examining the Impact of Assistive Technology on Psychological Health, Family Education, and Curriculum Research in Japan: Insights from Artificial Intelligence
T2  - JOURNAL OF AUTISM AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to analyze the effect of psychological health based on artificial intelligence agent technology on the implementation effect of Japanese family education. By combining mobile agent technology and education thought, the system structure and working mechanism of the education support system of agents are studied to build personalized support for the family education system based on mobile agents. A total of 320 Japanese middle school students were randomly divided into an experimental group and a control group, with 160 cases in each group. The control group received traditional family health education, while the experimental group received mental health education based on the Agent Technology family education system. The basic information and mental health scores of the two groups of students were compared. The results showed that there were no remarkable differences in the number of male and female cases, weight, height, average age, grade, home address, or family situation between groups (p > 0.05). The psychological health level of the experimental group was considerably superior to that of the control group regarding obsessional symptoms, interpersonal tension and sensitivity, depression, anxiety, learning pressure, maladaptation, emotional imbalance, and psychological imbalance (p < 0.05). In summary, compared with traditional family education, family education of the mental health education system based on agent technology can better improve the level of middle school students' mental health, which can improve student forced symptoms, interpersonal tension and sensitivity, depression, anxiety, learning pressure, maladjustment, emotional imbalance, psychological imbalance, and many other psychological states. Furthermore, personalized support for family education systems based on mobile agents has the advantages of autonomy, responsiveness, initiative, and mobility, which provides a new idea for family education.

TI  - An evaluation of professional development for staff working with nursing students in distress
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Clinical learning experiences are known to exacerbate nursing student anxiety, causing them to present to clinical placement in distressed, meaning anxious, states. Students already living with anxiety are also more likely to suffer setbacks at this time. Supervising Registered Nurses (RNs), in the clinical settings, struggle to support this student cohort. A professional development activity was designed to introduce RNs to higher education and nursing students' known mental health concerns (such as anxiety) and to arm them with strategies for working with distressed students. A research approach that enabled researchers to collaborate with participants was employed to design the intervention. A study evaluated the impact of the educational intervention with 45 Australian RN supervisors. Two tailed T-tests were chosen to explore the statistical difference between pre- and post-test mean results across the survey items. A 95% confidence interval was used. Statistical significance was set at <0.05. The evaluation indicated the activity could be useful for improving supervising RNs' mental health literacy, thus enhancing their understanding of how to work with distressed students. Participants recommended the activity be offered to any staff supporting student clinical learning. Collaboration between nursing researchers and nursing clinical staff produced a meaningful professional development activity and motivated the participants to increase their mental health literacy and understanding of strategies to support distressed students. Future projects should adopt similar approaches that would support both RNs' ability to support students' during clinical learning and students in distress would also benefit.

TI  - A systematic review of the long-term benefits of school mental health and wellbeing interventions for students in Australia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Over the last decade there has been increased recognition about the role of school staff in preventing mental ill health and promoting wellbeing in young people. Despite this, information regarding the long-term benefits of school mental health programs is not widely available. Aims: The aim of this systematic review was to synthesize the evidence for school-based mental health and wellbeing programs which are available in Australia and have been shown to have long-term benefits for children and adolescents. Results: This systematic review of the literature identified 74 articles reporting long-term outcomes for student mental health and wellbeing, distributed across 29 unique programs. Common features of efficacious programs included cognitive behavioral interventions, mental health literacy, and social-emotional skills programs. Conclusions: Some of the identified school-based interventions for student mental health and wellbeing demonstrated long-term positive impacts on students' physical and psychological health and wellbeing.

TI  - The use of film-based interventions in adolescent mental health education: A systematic review
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Film-based interventions have been embraced by adolescents as educational tools, but their efficacy in mental health education remains under-explored. In this review, we systematically examined the use of film-based interventions in adolescent mental health education. A systematic review of the empirical literature was conducted using the following databases: Academic Search Complete, Education Full Text [H.W. Wilson], CINAHL Plus with Full Text, Humanities Full Text [H.W. Wilson], MEDLINE, APA PsycArticles, APA PsycInfo, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, Social Sciences Full Text [H.W. Wilson], Soc Index, ERIC. Risk of Bias were assessed using Version 2 of the Cochrane RoB tool for randomised trials (RoB2) or the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias In Non-randomised Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I). Ten peer-reviewed studies were included in this review. Film emerged as a promising education method for enhancing metal health literacy and reducing stigma. Mixed reports were found for improving attitudes towards help-seeking, with narrative-based films having a weaker effect on attitudes towards help-seeking when compared with more instructive approaches. No study focussed on resilience. This review highlights the utility and potential for film-based interventions in adolescent mental health education. Further research is warranted around how best to implement such interventions to engage adolescents.

TI  - Universal and selective interventions to promote good mental health in young people: Systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - EUROPEAN NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Promotion of good mental health in young people is important. Our aim was to evaluate the consistency and magnitude of the efficacy of universal/selective interventions to promote good mental health. A systematic PRISMA/RIGHT-compliant meta-analysis (PROSPERO: CRD42018088708) search of Web of Science until 04/31/2019 identified original studies comparing the efficacy of universal/selective interventions for good mental health vs a control group, in samples with a mean age < 35 years. Meta-analytical random-effects model, heterogeneity statistics, assessment of publication bias, study quality and sensitivity analyses investigated the efficacy (Hedges' g = effect size, ES) of universal/selective interventions to promote 14 good mental health outcomes defined a-priori. 276 studies were included (total participants: 159,508, 79,142 interventions and 80,366 controls), mean age = 15.0 (SD = 7.4); female = 56.0%. There was a significant overall improvement in 10/13 good mental health outcome categories that could be meta-analysed: compared to controls, interventions significantly improved (in descending order of magnitude) mental health literacy (ES = 0.685, p < 0.001), emotions (ES = 0.541, p < 0.001), self-perceptions and values (ES = 0.49, p < 0.001), quality of life (ES = 0.457, p = 0.001), cognitive skills (ES = 0.428, p < 0.001), social skills (ES = 0.371, p < 0.001), physical health (ES = 0.285, p < 0.001), sexual health (ES = 0.257, p = 0.017), academic/occupational performance (ES = 0.211, p < 0.001) and attitude towards mental disorders (ES = 0.177, p = 0.006). Psychoeducation was the most effective intervention for promoting mental health literacy (ES = 0.774, p < 0.001) and cognitive skills (ES = 1.153, p = 0.03). Physical therapy, exercise and relaxation were more effective than psychoeducation and psychotherapy for promoting physical health (ES= 0.498, p<0.001). In conclusion, several universal/selective interventions can be effective to promote good mental health in young people. Future research should consolidate and extend these findings.

TI  - Evaluation of a pilot online education program to develop midwives' knowledge, skill and confidence in perinatal mental health in rural South Australia
T2  - WOMEN AND BIRTH
M3  - Article
AB  - One in five women will experience perinatal anxiety and/or depression. In South Australia, a rural health service identified a high proportion of women with risk of perinatal mental health challenges and sought additional education for midwives. In response, a six-week facilitated, online perinatal mental health education program (ePMHEP) was piloted. Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the (e-PMHEP) for rural midwives, nurses and Aboriginal maternal infant care practitioners. Method: Program evaluation incorporated a validated online pre/post survey to assess self-reported knowledge, skill and confidence regarding perinatal mental healthcare. Additional questions sought feedback on satisfaction and feasibility. Findings: Sixteen participants from rural South Australia engaged in the project from June to August 2022. Twelve participants completed the online pre/post survey. The overall pre/post knowledge scores were statistically significant (t = 2.73, 8df, p = 0.025) with improvement from the pre to post-test. Pre/post data also showed a measurable increase in confidence and skills. All respondents agreed that the content addressed their learning needs and would recommend this program to other practitioners. Discussion: The e-PMHEP appeared beneficial in developing knowledge, skills and confidence regarding perinatal mental healthcare in rural midwives and practitioners. Only a third of practitioners routinely developed a mental health care plan with women. Key strengths of the program included the accessible content, and the combination of an experienced mental health clinician and a facilitator with lived experience. Conclusion: Providing an accessible, facilitated online perinatal mental health education program could be beneficial for rural midwives.

TI  - What is known about the development of relational competence in the mental health education of healthcare professionals - a scoping review.
T2  - BMC medical education
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Therapeutic relationships with persons with mental health challenges are central to healthcare professionals' work in mental healthcare. In the context of mental healthcare, healthcare professionals often work with persons who have challenges related to their emotional lives, which may be particularly challenging in relational work. This places high demands on the relational competence of healthcare professionals. An overview of pedagogical strategies to promote relational competence in mental health education of healthcare professionals is lacking and more knowledge is needed in this field. The aim of this study was to examine the body of knowledge on how the development of relational competence can be promoted and hampered in mental health education of healthcare professionals, as well as to identify knowledge gaps in this field.METHODS: A scoping review was conducted with systematic searches in Medline, PsychInfo, Cinahl, Eric, Embase, and British Nursing Index, as well as hand searches in the reference lists of the included studies.RESULTS: Forty scientific studies were included in this review in which qualitative methods (n=18), quantitative methods (n=16), and mixed methods (n=6) were employed. The results show interventions that promote and hamper the development of relational competence in the mental health education of healthcare professionals. Learning interventions were organised into two themes. The first, individual active participation, describes promoting interventions and includes the sub-themes mapping training needs, learning through reflection, learning through active engagement in the classroom, learning in real-life situations, and learning through knowledge of lived experience. The second theme, receiving knowledge passively, describes hampering factors, which includes the sub-theme of learning through an explanatory theoretical approach.CONCLUSION: Learning interventions focusing on students' individual active participation seem to promote the development of relational competence. Receiving knowledge passively is found to hinder the development of relational competence.

TI  - What Do Parents Know and Perceive About Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Treatments?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Parents' knowledge, understanding and attitudes have a strong influence on treatment outcomes in child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP). However, little is known about parents' knowledge, perceptions and awareness regarding assessment, intervention and treatment options in CAP. Methods: We evaluated 1872 parents (1104 mothers [59.0%], 768 fathers [41.0%]) who were over 18 years of age and had at least one child between the ages of 0-18, regardless of whether their child had previously received CAP treatment, using a questionnaire containing 29 questions. Results: The most common misconceptions about CAP application records were that psychiatric records would cause difficulties in getting a job (92.6%) and would be obstacles to appointment to civil service (65.8%) and to getting driver's licence (34.8%). Regarding CAP drug treatments, the most frequently reported false beliefs were that psychiatric drugs cause weight gain (80.1%), are addictive (65.1%), cause long-lasting side effects (53.5%), numb the mind and cause drowsiness (52.7%), alter children's personalities (44.4%) and increase suicide risk (42.9%). Furthermore, 1105 (59.0%) participants answered 'Psychiatric disorders cannot be treated effectively even if psychiatric medications are used.' Conclusions: Our results indicated that parents' knowledge level was inadequate, and their attitudes and beliefs were negative and limited regarding CAP and treatments; in turn, they avoided treatment and did not engage in help-seeking behaviours. This study shows an urgent need for mental health education programs to increase parents' awareness and understanding of CAP and promote appropriate access to services.

TI  - Multi-level intervention for HIV/AIDS caring in Indonesian community
T2  - HIV & AIDS REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Treating the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) needs to be carried out with community participation. Caring community behavior problems require holistic approach for each individual element as well as society related to cultural factors and community contexts, such as norms, relationships, and critical structural factors in strengthening desired outcomes, especially in HIV/AIDS prevention. Some interventions aimed at increasing diversity of participants, and were mostly focused on overcoming individual-level of barriers to research participation. Most of the interventions did not evaluate their effectiveness on increasing the level of trial participation. Overall, there is little focus on interventions aimed at researchers, clinical trials, institutional policy factors, or studies. Therefore, a HIV/AIDS model of intervention is needed that emphasizes the inter-relationship of community elements, with local socio-cultural approaches through multi-level interventions.

AB  - Objective: Johnson & Johnson Global Public Health and the Ministry of Health of Rwanda strengthened the mental health awareness by providing an innovative, low-cost, easily accessible, and scalable remote training service (RTS) on mental health for Community Health Workers (CHWs).Methods: The RTS consisted of eight training modules shared via simple feature phones over a 4-week period. Quiz questions and baseline/endline assessments were included to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the training platform, the knowledge and self-confidence gained by the CHWs, and prospects for the sustainability of the platform.Results: Ninety-three percent of the CHWs completed at least four of the eight training modules, and 42% of the CHWs improved with a higher end score. The training content was considered interesting, easy to understand, and helpful to intervene appropriately to refer patients with signs of mental illness to a hospital and to provide community and family education on mental health topics.Conclusion: The RTS is feasible and acceptable for the delivery of mental health training on a large scale and contributed to strengthening the capacity in delivering mental health care at community level.

AB  - Objective: This study aims to analyze adolescent mental health problems in middle school Technology and Home Economics textbooks, focusing on the 2015 revised curriculum standards. Methods: Using Elo and Kyngas' (2008) qualitative content analysis, 12 textbooks from the 2015 Revised Curriculum for Middle School Technology and Home Economics were examined. Results: Six adolescent mental health issues were identified: stress, depression, suicide, anger control disorder, addiction, and eating disorders. Each issue was analyzed for its definition, symptoms, impact, causes, and prevention and management strategies. Analysis revealed inconsistencies in content coverage and depth.Analysis revealed inconsistencies in content coverage and depth. Stress was well-covered, while suicide and eating disorders had notable gaps, particularly in prevention strategies. Conclusions: A standardized framework for presenting mental health content in textbooks is needed to ensure comprehensive coverage. Such a framework, aligned with mental health standards, could improve students' understanding and management of mental health issues, enhancing their well-being and coping skills. The findings support the enhancement of mental health education in the curriculum.

TI  - Skill Enactment and Knowledge Acquisition in Digital Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Depression and Anxiety: Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Digital cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) interventions can effectively prevent and treat depression and anxiety, but engagement with these programs is often low. Although extensive research has evaluated program use as a proxy for engagement, the extent to which users acquire knowledge and enact skills from these programs has been largely overlooked. Objective: This study aimed to investigate how skill enactment and knowledge acquisition have been measured, evaluate postintervention changes in skill enactment and knowledge acquisition, examine whether mental health outcomes are associated with skill enactment or knowledge acquisition, and evaluate predictors of skill enactment and knowledge acquisition. Methods: PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane CENTRAL were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between January 2000 and July 2022. We included RCTs comparing digital CBT with any comparison group in adolescents or adults (aged =12 years) for anxiety or depression. Eligible studies reported quantitative measures of skill enactment or knowledge acquisition. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for RCTs. Narrative synthesis was used to address the review questions. Results: In total, 43 papers were included, of which 29 (67%) reported a skill enactment measure and 15 (35%) reported a knowledge acquisition measure. Skill enactment was typically operationalized as the frequency of enacting skills using the completion of in-program activities (ie, formal skill enactment; 13/29, 45%) and intervention-specific (9/29, 31%) or standardized (8/29, 28%) questionnaires. Knowledge measures included tests of CBT knowledge (6/15, 40%) or mental health literacy (5/15, 33%) and self-report questionnaires (6/15, 40%). In total, 17 studies evaluated postintervention changes in skill enactment or knowledge acquisition, and findings were mostly significant for skill enactment (6/8, 75% of the studies), CBT knowledge (6/6, 100%), and mental health literacy (4/5, 80%). Of the 12 studies that evaluated the association between skill enactment and postintervention mental health outcomes, most reported >= 1 significant positive finding on standardized questionnaires (4/4, 100%), formal skill enactment indicators (5/7, 71%), or intervention-specific questionnaires (1/1, 100%). None of the 4 studies that evaluated the association between knowledge acquisition and primary mental health outcomes reported significant results. A total of 13 studies investigated predictors of skill enactment; only type of guidance and improvements in psychological variables were associated with increased skill enactment in >= 2 analyses. Predictors of knowledge acquisition were evaluated in 2 studies. Conclusions: Digital CBT for depression and anxiety can improve skill enactment and knowledge acquisition. However, only skill enactment appears to be associated with mental health outcomes, which may depend on the type of measure examined. Additional research is needed to understand what types and levels of skill enactment and knowledge acquisition are most relevant for outcomes and identify predictors of these constructs.

TI  - What are the perceived barriers for building and maintaining a culture of mental health support in Australian competitive youth sport?
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED SPORT PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The mental health of young people in youth sport has received growing academic attention and sporting clubs are identified as important settings for prevention and early intervention. Despite this, very few studies have explored the perceptions of multiple stakeholders about youth sporting clubs as spaces for mental health awareness, education, and training. The purpose of the study was to understand the capacity of youth sporting clubs1 to become a site for general mental health support and explore parents, coaches, club leaders and youth participants perceptions about their sporting club's readiness for mental health awareness, education, and training initiatives. Using an Interpretive Description (ID) research methodology, 26 participants (parents, youth, club leaders/coaches) involved in community-level youth sport participated in a qualitative telephone interview. Data was analyzed thematically, leading to the construction of three themes about the barriers for building and maintaining a culture of mental health support in youth sport: (a) initial resistance, (b) teething issues and (c) turbulence. The themes reflected perceptions about varying levels of club readiness for meaningfully supporting positive mental health and indicated that many youth sporting clubs may find it difficult to sustain long-term, positive change. The study suggests that while sport can be a promising avenue to promote positive mental health, it is not without multiple forms of resistance, which if not navigated, may discourage efforts to establish and maintain club settings as sites for mental health, education, awareness, and first aid training. Implications for the field are discussed. Lay Summary: Parents, youth sport participants and club leaders/coaches were interviewed for the purpose of understanding their views of youth sporting clubs' capacity to become a site for mental health support. The thematic findings suggest that clubs are differentially equipped to support meaningful cultural change surrounding mental health and sport.PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICEClubs seeking to become a site for mental health support encounter various barriers and therefore display differential levels of "readiness" for change.To meaningfully and sustainably create clubs that support mental health, additional intervention methods are necessary to support mental health education, awareness-raising activities and first aid training in youth sport.

TI  - Localising the Partners in Parenting program for Malaysia (PiP Malaysia): A qualitative study of cultural considerations
T2  - CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - In Malaysia, parental concerns about adolescent mental health have increased exponentially in recent years. However, parental mental health literacy remains low and culturally-sensitive parenting resources are scarce in Malaysia. The Partners in Parenting (PiP) program provides a framework of evidence-based parenting domains (henceforth 'PiP framework') that are universally adaptive for adolescent mental health-presenting as a good candidate for implementation in other cultures. Guided by the Double Diamond framework, this study aimed to identify cultural considerations for localising PiP to the Malaysian context. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 38 primary caregivers (Mage = 47.1 years), who reflected on their parenting of their children during adolescence (aged 12-17 years). A thematic analysis using a deductive approach was conducted, using the PiP framework as a reference to identify cultural considerations in relation to five selected PiP parenting domains. Four overarching themes describing these cultural considerations were identified-Religion, Extended family, Gender roles, and Intergenerational influences-which were each relevant to one or more PiP parenting domains. These considerations, which reflect the complex interplay between parenting practices and the broader sociocultural environment in Malaysia, were further organised and interpreted within the context of the five interconnected cultural systems of the Bronfenbrenner socioecological model. Our approach facilitated a strategic, targeted localisation process, by identifying cultural considerations to be integrated into evidence-based intervention content. The context-specific implications for the localisation of PiP for Malaysia are discussed.

TI  - To Increase Mental Health Literacy and Human Rights Among New-Coming, Low-Educated Mothers With Experience of War: A Culturally, Tailor-Made Group Health Promotion Intervention With Participatory Methodology Addressing Indirectly the Children
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the increasing numbers of newcomers with impacts of war, civil war and persecution, at high risk of trauma-related mental health problems, there is a need for increase the poor mental health literacy (MHL) and human rights among the new-comers, especially low-educated mothers with children. This article aimed to present a case study report of several years' experience of tailor-made group health promotion intervention. It describes as an example, a project during autumn 2018 in five municipalities of Sweden and in collaboration between academia, primary care, social welfare, police, and an NGO. Fifty-one women, Arabic- or Somalian speaking, with 1-7 children, mean age 40 years, low-educated and in average four years' of living in Sweden participated. Under supervision, a local female member of the NGO coordinated the group meetings in Swedish with up to ten participants and the moderators were representatives of healthcare, social services and police/lawyer, with an interpreter present. Each intervention focused on human rights, health including mental health, psychosocial and parenting support, by using a 5-week group intervention a 2 h/week, totally 10 h excluding pre- and post-evaluation, and one language per intervention. Each meeting included 1-h lecture and after a short break with refreshments, the participants asked questions to the respective moderator. It was a mixed method but emphasis on qualitative design and participatory methodology with co-creation and evaluation of the intervention. The results showed that this tailor-made group intervention gave the participants empowerment and a sense of coherence, MHL and tools to deal with stress/anxiety, based on their needs that were mapped before in a pilot study during Spring 2018, indirectly addressing their children. However, they did not primarily talk about mental illness experience. It is vital that these interventions toward the target group with limited exposure to Western concepts (e.g., illness, anxiety, and trauma), may bridge the gap between Western and traditional cultural understanding of pre- and postmigration stress. In conclusion, MHL may be a function of both the cultural origin of the target group's background and their resettlement in a Western reception country. Implications are discussed.

TI  - The Impact of Video-Based Microinterventions on Attitudes Toward Mental Health and Help Seeking in Youth: Web-Based Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Mental health (MH) problems in youth are prevalent, burdening, and frequently persistent. Despite the existence of effective treatment, the uptake of professional help is low, particularly due to attitudinal barriers. Objective: This study evaluated the effectiveness and acceptability of 2 video -based microinterventions aimed at reducing barriers to MH treatment and increasing the likelihood of seeking professional help in young people. Methods: This study was entirely web based and open access. The interventions addressed 5 MH problems: generalized anxiety disorder, depression, bulimia, nonsuicidal self -injury, and problematic alcohol use. Intervention 1 aimed to destigmatize and improve MH literacy, whereas intervention 2 aimed to induce positive outcome expectancies regarding professional help seeking. Of the 2435 participants who commenced the study, a final sample of 1394 (57.25%) participants aged 14 to 29 years with complete data and sufficient durations of stay on the video pages were randomized in a fully automated manner to 1 of the 5 MH problems and 1 of 3 conditions (control, intervention 1, and intervention 2) in a permuted block design. After the presentation of a video vignette, no further videos were shown to the control group, whereas a second, short intervention video was presented to the intervention 1 and 2 groups. Intervention effects on self -reported potential professional help seeking (primary outcome), stigma, and attitudes toward help seeking were examined using analyses of covariance across and within the 5 MH problems. Furthermore, we assessed video acceptability. Results: No significant group effects on potential professional help seeking were found in the total sample ( F 2,1385 =0.99; P =.37). However, the groups differed significantly with regard to stigma outcomes and the likelihood of seeking informal help ( F 2,1385 = 3 . 75 ; P =.02). Furthermore, separate analyses indicated substantial differences in intervention effects among the 5 MH problems. Conclusions: Interventions to promote help seeking for MH problems may require disorder -specific approaches. The study results can inform future research and public health campaigns addressing adolescents and young adults.

TI  - Changes in Stigmatising Beliefs and Help-Seeking Intentions Following a Recreational Peer-Based Program for Young People Affected by Military Associated Parental Mental Illness
T2  - JOURNAL OF MILITARY AND VETERANS HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Children living in Defence families affected by parental mental illness face increased stressors, pressure for self-sufficiency and potential exposure to adverse outcomes, including future mental illness. Little is known about the impact of mental health early interventions on the help-seeking tendencies of military young people affected by parental mental illness. Similarly, the responsivity of this cohort to peer-based mental health literacy interventions aimed to dispel misconceptions and stigmatising beliefs about mental illness and help-seeking is not well understood. The current study measured key aspects of belief-related mental health knowledge and intentions to seek help from a range of formal and informal sources of 236 Australian young people aged 7-18 years, living with parents affected by military-associated mental health problems. Findings suggest that young people in the Defence community are most likely to seek help from their parents and show changes in beliefs about mental illness and intentions to seek help from some help sources following a brief (2-hour) group intervention. Help-seeking intentions from telephone helplines increased for the cohort, and males were more inclined to seek help from a friend after intervention.Limitations including the absence of a comparison or control group, issues in data measurement protocols and a need for long-term follow-up were future research directions.

TI  - Barriers to timely identification of bipolar disorder in youth: a multidimensional perspective
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Bipolar disorder (BD) in youth often goes unrecognized and therefore untreated. However, little is known about pathways to treatment of youth with BD and factors that influence the time taken for each stage of these pathways. In this article, we use the conceptual framework by Scott and colleagues called the Model of Pathways to Treatment as a foundation to explore the components of delay in the diagnosis and treatment of youth with BD. The total time from the onset of symptoms until treatment initiation was divided into four sequential intervals; i.e., the Appraisal, the Help-seeking, the Diagnostic and the Pre-treatment intervals and potential disease, patient, and healthcare system/provider factors that influence each interval were identified. This multidimensional conceptual framework can offer a systematic approach to understanding and exploring barriers to early identification and interventions in BD, which is a crucial step in the development of strategies to facilitate prompt diagnosis and treatment. We hope this work contributes to the discussion on delayed diagnosis and treatment of youth with BD and provides a roadmap to inform future research studies and policy decisions.

T2  - The mental health clinician
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Introduction: One in 5 adults in the United States have depression and are at risk for suicide, the 11th leading cause of death in the United States. Community pharmacy settings are ideal for increasing access to mental health services. Our objectives were to assess PHQ-9 scores and evaluate participant satisfaction in a student pharmacist-led depression screening program in a community pharmacy.Methods: Student pharmacists trained in mental health first aid recruited participants 18 to 90 years old in a community pharmacy to complete the PHQ-9 and provided mental health education, referrals, and resources. A 2-week follow-up was completed, and participants reported on actions taken since the initial visit. Descriptive statistics, independent t tests, and chi 2 tests were used in data analysis.Results: Twelve depression screening events were held, and 70 participants completed the screenings. The mean age was 52 years, and 75.7% were female. PHQ-9 scores ranged from 0 to 24 with an average of 3.96. Most participants (92.9%) reported the depression screening program was helpful. More than 90% of participants completed the 2-week follow-up, and 92.3% reported being comfortable seeking mental health services from a pharmacist. About half (53.8%) reported reading the educational materials, 24.6% helped a friend or family member, and 16.9% made an appointment with their health care provider.Discussion: Student pharmacists successfully provided depression screenings and mental health education in a community pharmacy. Most participants had low PHQ-9 scores, found the program helpful, and are willing to utilize mental health services in a community pharmacy.

TI  - Assessing the Utility of Mental Health First Aid Training for Physician Assistant Students.
T2  - The journal of physician assistant education : the official journal of the Physician Assistant Education Association
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Physician assistant (PA) students are at increased risk for anxiety and depression compared with the general population. The demands of studying medicine can contribute to a decline in mental health, which may impede a student's ability to progress in his or her PA program. Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) is one strategy that can be used to increase mental health literacy, promote help-seeking behavior, reduce stigma, and improve confidence in providing help to individuals showing signs of a mental health disorder. The aim of this outcomes assessment was to assess PA students' satisfaction with the MHFA course and their posttraining confidence in using the skills learned.METHODS: Participants were PA students (N = 435) across 9 PA programs in their didactic year of training who had completed an MHFA course through the PA Foundation's Mental Health Outreach Fellowship. MHFA postcourse evaluations, completed by the PA students, were analyzed to determine PA students' satisfaction with the course and their posttraining confidence in using the skills learned to help both themselves as well as the general population.RESULTS: The mean of the MHFA course evaluation items corresponding to satisfaction with the course was 4.82 (maximum score of 5), and the mean of the items corresponding to posttraining confidence in using the skills learned was 4.74 (maximum score of 5). When asked, "Would you recommend this course to others?" 99.3% of the PA students trained in MHFA answered "yes," indicating a high level of satisfaction with the training they had received.DISCUSSION: PA students who received MHFA training from the PA Foundation's Mental Health Outreach fellows showed high levels of satisfaction with the MHFA course and posttraining confidence in using the skills learned.

TI  - Potential moderators and mediators of intervention effects in a sport-based mental health literacy and resilience program for adolescent men
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED SPORT PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICEIncreasing resilience is an important pathway through which mental health promotion and prevention programs may promote well-being and reduce distressMental health knowledge prior to the delivery of mental health literacy does not appear to effect program effectivenessAthletes aged from 12 to 18 years of age may benefit similarly from the same mental health promotion and prevention programsEngaging young men in mental health promotion initiatives is important given the negative attitudes toward mental health and increased suicide rates, reported by young men. Ahead of the Game (AOTG) is a sport-based, psychoeducational initiative which uses sports as a mental health and resilience promotional medium. This study sought contribute to the literature on the effectiveness of the AOTG program by exploring for whom, and through what mechanisms, the intervention works. A secondary analysis of the AOTG randomized controlled trial was conducted, which comprised a sample of 350 adolescent male sport-playing participants (M = 14.53 years, SD = 1.19 years) and control group of 466 sport participants (M = 14.66 years, SD = 1.39), various mental health related measures were taken at baseline and at approximately 8 weeks follow-up. Moderation analyses were conducted to examine age, socioeconomic status, and baseline measures of mental health as potential moderators of program effects. Mediation analyses were run to explore whether changes in psychological distress and wellbeing were mediated by changes in AOTG's various primary mental health related outcomes. Results indicated age did not moderate any effects of AOTG. Meanwhile, socioeconomic status and baseline help seeking, implicit beliefs, and psychological distress all showed signs of moderating main effects of AOTG. Mediation analyses revealed that changes in resilience and implicit beliefs partially mediated changes in psychological distress. Further, increased resilience had an indirect effect of on athletes' wellbeing. The implications and future directions, in light of these findings, are explored. Lay summary: Ahead of the Game was shown to be effective regardless of age and particularly beneficial for those in low socioeconomic, displaying low levels of help seeking, and those with higher psychological distress. Increasing resilience was also shown to be an important pathway for increasing wellbeing and reducing distress.

TI  - Impact of virtual brief wellness based psychosocial intervention on mental wellbeing of stable hospitalised COVID-19 patients - A pilot study.
T2  - The Medical journal of Malaysia
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Optimal Health Program (OHP) is a collaborative self-management program that promotes clients to be actively involved in their own healthcare and overall wellbeing. Program Kesihatan Optimum (SANUBARI) is a Malay version of the OHP after a translational process and cultural adaptation by psychiatrists, clinical psychologist and family medicine specialists in 2017. The program is of a low intensity, patient-centred program, advocating self-health management to improve health literacy by enhancing self-efficacy, building strengths and values, and initiating change and planning, ultimately enhancing wellbeing of people. The programme can be used as a form of early psychosocial intervention during the current pandemic in maintaining the general mental wellbeing of COVID-19 patients.METHODS: This is an open labelled interventional study of a virtual brief psychosocial intervention, called SANUBARI. The program was conducted among COVID-19 patients hospitalized in the COVID-19 wards of two centres from May 2020 until August 2020. Inclusion criteria include patients aged eighteen years and above, diagnosed with COVID-19, medically stable, speaking and reading Bahasa Melayu or English. All study subjects attended two sessions on OHP via telecommunication method and answered questionnaires (General Self-Efficacy (GSE) Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire) via computer-assisted self-interview. Data collection was done before the start of the intervention, at the end of the intervention and a month post-intervention.RESULTS: A total of 37 patients were recruited and more than half of the subjects were males (62.2%), single (75.5%) and from the Malay ethnicity (78.4%). Seventy-three per cent of subjects had received tertiary education, and most of them were students reflecting a higher unemployment status (73%). Most subjects have no comorbid chronic medical illness (89.2%), and none has a comorbid psychiatric illness. Comparison of the GSE score across 3-time points (preintervention, immediate post-intervention and a month postintervention) showed statistically significant improvement in the mean total GSE score immediate and a month postintervention as compared to the pre-intervention; from mean total GSE score of 29.78 pre-intervention to 34.73 (mean difference 4.946, 95% Confidence Interval 95%CI: 3.361, 6.531) immediate post-intervention and 33.08 (mean difference 3.297, 95%CI: 1.211, 5.348) a month post intervention. There was no significant association between the socio-demographic or clinical data, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and changes in GSE scores over three time points.CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients improved their self-efficacy levels after the virtual brief OHP intervention, and it maintained a month post-intervention, protecting them from psychological stress and ultimately enhances wellbeing during this coronavirus pandemic.

TI  - Mental health first aid training among healthcare French students: a qualitative study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundHealthcare students are a population more at risk for mental health issues, especially anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts. The health faculty of Universite Paris Cite in France, Paris has implemented a Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) course aiming to improve students' mental health literacy, self-care and peer-support and to decrease stigma about mental illness. We conducted a qualitative study exploring the lived experience of this MHFA training course among healthcare students so to better assess its implementation within this specific context and population.MethodsThis qualitative study used the five-stage inductive process to analyze the structure of lived experience (IPSE) approach. All the healthcare students that had completed the 2-day MHFA training were approached to participate. Data was collected through individual semi-structured interviews and inclusion continued until data saturation was reached. Data analysis was based on an inductive, descriptive, and structuring procedure to determine the structure of lived experience characterized by the central axes of experience.ResultsTwenty students were included. Data analysis produced a common structure of lived experience based on three central axes of experience, (1) a personal experience, (2) a student experience and (3) a professional experience. The participants all experienced this course intertwined within these 3 axes. Their motivation to take the course was personal -being of feeling concerned by the topic-, was study-oriented - to learn and revise psychiatry- and was professional - so to develop both practical and soft skills. In their personal experience, participants reported a transformative experience and some interventions with friends and family, while both in their student and professional experience, they felt frustrated with both the content and the form of the course.ConclusionThe results reported similar outcomes reported in the literature about skills, knowledge, and awareness; but mostly produce original avenues about how to better adapt such course to this specific population so to better address students' expectations and mental health issues. This MHFA course -with an adapted content addressing eating disorders, self-mutilations and sexual and gender-based violence - could be part of the early curriculum of healthcare students. The latter could then benefit from a level 2/advanced MHFA course years later specifically tailored for healthcare professionals.

TI  - Predictors of help-seeking behavior in mothers of preschoolers
T2  - CLINICAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mental health difficulties in the preschool years require early intervention, but preschool children are underserved in mental healthcare. One explanation might be that parents do not seek services because their problem recognition, or labeling, ability is lacking. While previous research demonstrates that labeling is positively associated with help-seeking, interventions aimed at improving help-seeking by improving labeling are not always successful. Parental perceptions of severity, impairment, and stress also predict help-seeking, but have not been examined alongside labeling. Thus, it is unclear how much they add to the parental help-seeking process. The present study simultaneously examined labeling and parental perceptions of severity, impairment, and stress on help-seeking. Participants (82 adult mothers of children ages 3-5 years) read vignettes describing preschool-aged children with symptoms of depression, anxiety, and ADHD, and answered a series of questions to assess their labeling and likelihood of help-seeking for each of the problems presented. Help-seeking was found to be positively associated with labeling (r = .73; r = .60), severity (r = .66), impairment (r = .31), and stress (r = .25). Furthermore, severity, impairment, and stress predicted endorsements of help-seeking above and beyond what was predicted by labeling alone (R- 2  change = .12; chi(2) (3) = 20.03, p < .01). These results underscore the importance of parental perceptions of children's behavior to the help-seeking process.

AB  - BackgroundOver the last decade there has been increased recognition about the role of school staff in preventing mental ill health and promoting wellbeing in young people. Despite this, information regarding the long-term benefits of school mental health programs is not widely available.AimsThe aim of this systematic review was to synthesize the evidence for school-based mental health and wellbeing programs which are available in Australia and have been shown to have long-term benefits for children and adolescents.ResultsThis systematic review of the literature identified 74 articles reporting long-term outcomes for student mental health and wellbeing, distributed across 29 unique programs. Common features of efficacious programs included cognitive behavioral interventions, mental health literacy, and social-emotional skills programs.ConclusionsSome of the identified school-based interventions for student mental health and wellbeing demonstrated long-term positive impacts on students' physical and psychological health and wellbeing.

TI  - A systematic review of mental health literacy in Pakistan
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Review
AB  - Individual mental health has become a primary global concern. In Pakistan, the prevalence of mental health issues is still unclear, as not many studies have assessed the level of mental health literacy (MHL) in the country. This systematic review aims to bridge this gap by encouraging the early detection of mental disorders, lessening stigma, and improving help-seeking behavior. Nine electronic databases were searched to identify empirical literature in this area. Only studies that evaluated MHL efficacy and those published in English were selected. Non-peer reviewed articles and gray literature were excluded. From 613 studies retrieved, 59 studies met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Forty-three of the included studies mentioned mental health outcome measures (of which only four mentioned reliability indices), 13 discussed stigma, 18 examined help-seeking approaches to mental illness treatments, and 47 discussed mental health knowledge. Additionally, the outcome of the MHL measures had considerable heterogeneity and limited validity. Meta-analysis was not conducted due to a lack of MHL operationalization. Besides, the measurement tools in the studies lacked consistency and standardization. This review compiled the available studies on MHL to assist researchers currently studying the various dimensions of MHL, as well as those designing new studies or investigating effective methods to increase MHL. This review highlights the need for well-designed controlled intervention studies. Further implications for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers are mentioned.

TI  - Results of quality rights on human rights engagement, stigma and attitudes towards mental health among Colombian medical students
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Training healthcare professionals in human rights approaches is fundamental for humanizing medical practice and promoting patient autonomy.Aims To evaluate the impact of Quality Rights strategy training on human rights engagement, stigma reduction and attitudes towards mental health among medical students in Colombian.Method A pre-experimental study with pre-post measures was conducted, involving 194 medical students, during the first semester of 2024 in Manizales, Caldas, Colombia. To assess notions and commitment to human rights were used the Human Rights Exposure in Social Work and Human Rights Engagement in Social Work. Attitudes toward people with mental disorders were measured using the Community Attitudes Towards the Mentally III (CAMI) scale, and attitudes toward mental health education were assessed using the Mental Illness Clinicians' Attitude Scale (MICA). The intervention was based on QualityRights, an initiative of the World Health Organization, which aims to improve the quality of care in mental health services and to promote the human rights of people with psychosocial disabilities. Initial data comparisons were made using the Mann-Whitney U test and the Kruskal-Wallis test. Pretest and postest data were compared using the Wilcoxon test.Results Statistically significant improvements were observed in human rights understanding, reduced stigmatizing attitudes toward mental health and decreased authoritarianism. While students demonstrated enhanced human rights knowledge and less stigmatizing attitudes, we observed a concurrent decrease in benevolence scores.Conclusion The Quality Rights training strategy shows promise in improving medical students' understanding of mental health conditions and promoting empathetic practices. However, ongoing sustained and monitoring strategies are necessary to ensure long-term adoption of human rights-based attitudes and practices in healthcare settings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Brain Doctors is a community-engaged mental health education program developed using the Food Doctors model to enhance third-grade students' understanding of self and community wellness. This study serves as an evaluation of the pilot program.METHODS: Two dynamic, interactive 1-hour sessions were created, with pre-session and post-session assessments used to measure student growth. The sessions were presented at 2 elementary schools in Milwaukee, Wisconsin by medical students. Feedback was gathered through participant satisfaction surveys following each session.RESULTS: Student feedback indicated that most participants had a positive experience with the program. Pre-assessment (n=116) and post-assessment (n=125) results revealed areas of improvement and areas where performance declined.DISCUSSION: The elementary students' positive response demonstrated their enthusiasm for the program. This study affirmed our perception that elementary and medical students can engage meaningfully in emotional wellness education.

T2  - ENTERTAINMENT COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Go plays a very prominent role in quality education and mental health education. Go can cultivate character, make friends, improve interpersonal relationships, and promote mental health. To apply it to mental health and emotional regulation, the AlphaGo series algorithms are analyzed. To address the unstable deep reinforcement learning training, low training data utilization, model sensitivity to hyper-parameters, and heavy parameter tuning burden, the algorithm is optimized by combining ensemble learning and advanced deep reinforcement learning. Then, the weighted voting method is applied to the selection step of sub nodes in the Monte Carlo tree search process. At the same time, asynchronous parallelization improvements are implemented to improve the efficiency of the Monte Carlo tree search algorithm. Finally, a board game based on ensemble learning and improved Monte Carlo tree search algorithm is obtained. Through experimental analysis, the average winning rate of the system was 93.36 %. The number of users who were very satisfied with the game was 83.96 %. After intervention, the depression and anxiety scores of the experimental group students were significantly lower than the control group (P < 0.05). The designed game can effectively alleviate user anxiety and depression, providing new ideas for the psychotherapy.

TI  - Mental health training programs for community pharmacists, pharmacy staff and students: A systematic review
T2  - RESEARCH IN SOCIAL & ADMINISTRATIVE PHARMACY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Primary care is often the first point of contact for people living with mental disorders. Community pharmacists, pharmacy staff and students are increasingly being trained to deliver mental health care. However, there is still a gap in the literature exploring the characteristics of all available mental health training programs and their components and their influence on pharmacists, pharmacy staff and students' outcomes.Objectives: To summarize the evidence evaluating mental health training programs completed by community pharmacists, pharmacy staff and students. More specifically, to explore the components of mental health training programs and identify those that facilitate significant improvements in outcomes.Methods: A systematic review was conducted following the Cochrane handbook and reported according to PRISMA guidelines. A search for published literature was conducted in three databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) in July 2021. Eligible studies were included if they described and evaluated the impact of mental health training programs delivered to community pharmacists, pharmacy staff and pharmacy students regardless of design or comparator. The methodological quality of included studies was appraised using both the NIH quality assessment, to evaluate studies with an uncontrolled pre-post design, and the Cochrane EPOC risk of bias assessment, to evaluate studies with a controlled (randomized and non-randomized) study design.Results: Thirty-three studies were included. Most of the identified mental health training programs contained knowledge-based components and active learning activities. Changes in participants' attitudes, stigma, knowledge, confidence and skills were frequently assessed. An extensive range of self-assessment and observational instruments used to evaluate the impact of the training programs were identified. Positive improvements in participants' attitudes, knowledge and stigma were frequently identified following participation in training programs.Conclusions: This systematic review highlights the importance of mental health training programs in increasing pharmacists', pharmacy staff and pharmacy students' skills and confidence to deliver mental health care in community pharmacy. Future research should build upon this basis and further focus on finding the most efficient measures to evaluate these training programs and assess their long-term effectiveness, allowing comparison between programs.

T2  - JOURNAL OF AGROMEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesThis exploratory study aims to: 1) evaluate mental health stigma levels among agricultural youth directors, 2) examine the influence of professional characteristics on stigma, and 3) investigate the relationship between agricultural youth directors' stigma levels and their self-efficacy.MethodsAn online survey was administered from March to May 2022 to 642 agricultural youth directors in Illinois who work with youth aged 1-19. Directors' personal and perceived stigmas toward mental illness were measured using the Depression Stigma Scale. Directors' self-efficacy (perceived level of knowledge and confidence) across 19 mental health topics was measured using a 3-point Likert scale. Analyses were conducted by generating descriptive statistics and performing Mann-Whitney U tests on the data.ResultsThe median personal depression stigma score was 7.57 (SD = 8.02). Our analyses identified significantly higher personal depression stigma scores among men, FFA advisors, agricultural educators, and those lacking personal experience with mental illness. A lack of self-efficacy correlated significantly with increased personal stigma.ConclusionsThis study underscores the critical need for targeted educational interventions to reduce stigma among agricultural youth directors and enchance mental health literacy. Anti-stigma and mental health literacy initiatives are essential for fostering a supportive environment that encourages open discussions about mental health issues with youth within the agricultural community.

M3  - Early Access
AB  - The overall intent of this research is to determine the preferred death anxiety and interment stress family interventions for Filipino older adults. 214 Filipino respondents (18-75 years old) participated in this conjoint analysis study. Results showed that cognitive state (23.272%) is most important and spiritual state (17.256%) as least important family intervention. Part-worth of the attributes shows medical routines and procedures (.342) as most preferred for physical state; mental health awareness (.266) for cognitive state; livelihood trainings (.051) for social state; family therapy (.022) for psychological state; and church activities (.017) for spiritual state. Spiritual state, age, and number of children have marked associations. Respondents aged 60-75 with a higher number of children in the family, cope with death anxiety and interment stress through spirituality. Significant findings of this study will greatly contribute to the knowledge base of geriatric mental health care; including caregivers and family members of older adults.

TI  - A scoping review of the implementation and cultural adaptation of school-based mental health promotion and prevention interventions in low-and middle-income countries
T2  - CAMBRIDGE PRISMS-GLOBAL MENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Effective school-based mental health promotion and prevention interventions in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) can positively impact the mental health and well-being of large numbers of young people. This scoping review aimed to investigate the implementation of effective mental health promotion and prevention interventions in LMIC schools. A scoping review of the international literature was conducted and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. Medline, PsycInfo, Scopus, Embase, CINAHL and Cochrane were searched for peer-reviewed literature published from 2014 to 2022. PsycExtra, Google Scholar and the websites of key organisations were searched for relevant grey literature. Study selection focussed on mental health promotion interventions, including the development of social and emotional skills and mental health literacy, and prevention interventions, including anti-bullying and skill-based interventions for "at-risk" students. Twenty-seven studies evaluating 25 school-based interventions in 17 LMICs were included in the review. Fifteen interventions were developed in the implementing country and 10 were adapted from high-income countries (HICs) or other settings. Findings from the studies reviewed were generally positive, especially when interventions were implemented to a high quality. Universal life-skills interventions were found to increase social and emotional skills, decrease problem behaviours and positively impact students' mental health and well-being. Mental health literacy interventions increased mental health knowledge and decreased stigma among students and school staff. Outcomes for externally facilitated anti-bullying interventions were less positive. All 19 effective studies reported on some aspects of programme implementation, and 15 monitored implementation fidelity. Eleven studies outlined the programme's underpinning theoretical model. Only four studies reported on the cultural adaptation of programmes in detail. Including young people in the adaptation process was reported to facilitate natural cultural adaptation of programmes, while input from programme developers was considered key to ensuring that the core components of interventions were retained. The review findings indicate increasing evidence of effective mental health interventions in LMIC schools. To facilitate the sustainability, replication and scaling-up of these interventions, greater attention is needed to reporting on intervention core components, and the processes of implementation and cultural adaptation in the local setting.

TI  - Assessing the mediating role of self-disclosure between mental health literacy and psychological distress: a cross-sectional study among HIV-positive young and middle-aged men who have sex with men in China
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To investigate the associations between mental health literacy (MHL), self-disclosure and psychological distress among HIV-positive young and middle-aged men who have sex with men (MSM). We hypothesised that self-disclosure would mediate the relationship between MHL and psychological distress. Design A cross-sectional study. Setting Participants were recruited from the outpatient clinic of the Department of Infection at a tertiary hospital in Nanjing, Jiangsu province, China. Participants A total of 209 HIV-positive young and middle-aged MSM. Outcome measures Using convenient sampling method, the study selected 209 HIV-positive young and middle-aged MSM from a tertiary hospital in Nanjing, China, from November 2023 to January 2024. The data were collected using a general information questionnaire, the Multicomponent Mental Health Literacy, the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale and the Distress Disclosure Index. Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation analysis and mediation analysis were conducted in the study. Results The mean MHL score among HIV-positive young and middle-aged MSM was 11.90 (SD=5.09). Their mean score for self-disclosure was 31.97 (SD=6.87) and for psychological distress was 25.43 (SD=8.16). The bivariate correlation analysis showed that self-disclosure was positively correlated with MHL (r=0.264, p<0.001) and negatively correlated with psychological distress (r=-0.496, p<0.001), and MHL was negatively correlated with psychological distress (r=-0.308, p<0.001). Self-disclosure partially mediated the relationship between MHL and psychological distress among HIV-positive young and middle-aged MSM, and the mediating effect accounted for 38.31% of the total effect. Conclusion Self-disclosure mediated the relationship between MHL and psychological distress. To improve psychological distress among HIV-positive young and middle-aged MSM, targeted intervention measures aimed at enhancing MHL and self-disclosure should be conducted.

TI  - CHATogether: a novel digital program to promote Asian American Pacific Islander mental health in response to the COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY AND MENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated rise in anti-Asian hate crimes, we developed the Compassionate Home, Action Together program, (CHATogether) to support the mental health of the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community. CHATogether is a culturally informed and virtually delivered support program that harnesses the talents of AAPI teens, young adults, parents, and mental health professionals who share a commitment to serve their local communities. Methods Our objective was to identify the active components, optimal utilization, potential benefits, and pertinent limitations of the CHATogether program during the 3 years since its inception in 2019. By that time, the program had developed six distinct component arms: interactive theater, mental health education, research, peer support and community outreach, collaboration, and AAPI mentorship. To work towards this objective, we conducted a qualitative study using thematic analysis and an inductive approach based on grounded theory (GT), in which we analyzed anonymized transcripts of four focus groups, comprised of 20 program participants (11 females; 9 males). Results We developed a model of two overarching domains, each with three underlying themes: I. Individual stressors: (1) Family conflict; (2) Cultural identity; and (3) Pandemic impact; and II. Collective stressors: (1) Stigma related to mental health and illness; (2) Pandemic uncertainty; and (3) Xenophobia and societal polarization. Strengths of the CHATogether program include its role as a conduit toward AAPI connectedness and pride as well as purpose in building community. Through support and mentorship, the program cultivates a unique platform that promotes healing and resiliency in response to pandemic stressors and beyond. Conclusions CHATogether creates a safe space for the AAPI community. Through its methods of storytelling and encouraging creativity, CHATogether facilitates the discussion of challenging topics specific to the AAPI community. Given the national mental health crisis that is further being exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, a digital prevention program such as CHATogether holds promise towards providing access to mental health resources and supporting early help-seeking behaviors for individuals in the AAPI community.

T2  - REVISTA DE PSICOLOGIA DEL DEPORTE
M3  - Article
AB  - This research aims to examine the contribution of physical activity to children's mental health education during the epidemic era. In this study, 50 5-to 6-year-old children from a city were recruited as research subjects using interviews, literature review, and experimental statistics and then randomly divided into two groups: the experimental group and the control group. The psychological index data before and after the happy exercise were measured using a questionnaire survey. The psychological index data before and after 12 weeks of experimental practice were evaluated using data statistics. Six mental health indices demonstrated a significant difference between the experimental group and the control group, with the improvement value of the experimental group's movement score being 3.68 and the improvement value of the control group's movement score being 0.15. Social score improvement in the experimental group was 1.76, whereas, in the control group, it was 0.12. The value of language score improvement was 1.16, while the language score improvement in the control group was 0.14. The gymnastics sports curriculum is favorable to the mental health development of 56-year -old children and has significantly enhanced children's mental health.

T2  - HEALTHCARE
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent times, global crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and geopolitical conflicts have significantly impacted pupils' mental health. This opinion article presents evidence-based recommendations to bolster mental health support within educational systems, aiming to alleviate the psychological burden faced by students during these challenging times. This article argues that a proactive, holistic approach to mental health is essential for building a resilient educational infrastructure. More than ever, we support the call for the integration of mental health education into the core curriculum, equipping students with vital coping skills and fostering emotional intelligence. Additionally, we emphasize the importance of training educators and staff to identify and address mental health issues. Furthermore, this article highlights the need for interdisciplinary collaboration involving general practitioners, mental health professionals, community organizations, and policymakers in crafting and implementing support strategies. Educational institutions can effectively leverage the expertise of diverse stakeholders to create targeted interventions by cultivating partnerships. Finally, the significance of continuously evaluating and refining mental health support policies to ensure their efficacy and adaptability in the face of evolving crises is emphasized. Through these comprehensive recommendations, this opinion article seeks to catalyze a transformation in educational policies, prioritize mental health support, and empower pupils to thrive during tumultuous times.

TI  - Agents of Change for Mental Health: A Survey of Young People's Aspirations for Participation Across Five Low- and Middle-Income Countries
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Effective intervention, policy, and research inmental health andwell-being (MHWB) require young people to be understood not only as beneficiaries, but also as active agents in codesigning and implementing initiatives. To identify pathways for young people's participation in promoting MHWB in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), this study surveyed young people's aspirations for engagement, their spheres of influence, capacity building needs, and key barriers to participation.Methods: Using U-Report, United Nations Children's Emergency Fund's socialmessaging tool and data collection platform, we distributed a short quantitative survey to a nonrepresentative, but large sample of young people aged 15e29 across five LMICs: Nigeria, Brazil, Jamaica, South Africa, and Burundi.Results: A total of 42,689 young people responded, with representation from most or all provinces within each country. Participants' average age was 23.8 years (SD = 3.77). Young people's core aspirations were to join a mental health awareness project and to support their peers. Participants considered schools and community settings to be the most important spheres for engagement. Lack of information about mental health was the main perceived barrier to participation, and mental health classes the main training need.Discussion: In many countries, MHWB is not taught or discussed in schools and youth-led mental health interventions are rare. Findings from this study reveal clear aspirations for participatory engagement to promoteMHWBamong young people in LMICs. To support meaningful participation, policymakers and youth service providers must ensure that young people have access to mental health literacy training and opportunities to raise awareness in schools or community settings.

TI  - Are Agricultural Youth Directors Prepared to Talk About Mental Health?
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SAFETY AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates how frequently agricultural youth directors discuss mental health topics with youth and explores the influence of directors' knowledge and confidence on these discussions. We conducted a cross-sectional online survey assessing mental health knowledge and confidence among 242 directors from 4-H, Extension, and FFA in Illinois. The results indicate that discussions on sensitive mental health issues such as depression, suicide, traumatic experiences, isolation, eating disorders, self-harm, and substance use are infrequent and correlate with agricultural youth directors' limited knowledge and confidence in addressing these issues. The findings underscore the importance of mental health literacy as an essential part of professional development for agricultural youth directors and advocate for integrating mental health considerations into youth development models in agriculture. This research fills a gap in the existing literature on mental health in agricultural settings by pinpointing key areas for improving agricultural youth directors' ability to support youth mental health effectively.

TI  - Adolescents as co-designers: adapting human-centered design to develop school-based mental health strategies in northern Ghana
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Adolescents in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) face significant mental health challenges, yet their perspectives are often underrepresented in the design of preventive strategies. Co-design approaches, such as human-centered design (HCD), offer a promising way to tailor interventions and implementation strategies to adolescents' needs and local context. In LMICs, these methods require careful adaptation to address resource constraints, limited design literacy, and cultural norms. This study documents how HCD was adapted to engage adolescents in northern Ghana as co-designers of school-based mental health preventive strategies. Methods Guided by the first two phases of HCD, we conducted two workshops with 24 students from 12 public senior high schools in Tamale, Ghana. Workshop 1 (Inspiration) used structured, case-based discussions informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to explore adolescents' perspectives on mental health. Workshop 2 (Ideation) used interactive choice-based activities to elicit youth-generated strategies. To align with cognitive and sociocultural factors, we incorporated scaffolded facilitation, hands-on activities, and peer-led engagement. Qualitative data from facilitator notes, artifacts, and audio-confirmed summaries were synthesized using structured rapid qualitative analysis. Results Adolescents identified key mental health concerns, including stigma, peer and family influences, and fears about confidentiality. Gender-specific discussions revealed culturally rooted concerns, such as peer pressure and substance use among boys and limited support-seeking among girls. Adolescents prioritized five school strategies: teacher training, curricular integration, mentorship programs, activities that promote positive thinking and mindfulness, and entertainment-based mental health education. Youth demonstrated a conceptual shift from viewing mental health as an individual problem to a shared responsibility across schools and communities. Formation of an Adolescent Advisory Board reflected youth interest in sustained leadership and co-design. Conclusions Contextualized co-design methods can meaningfully engage adolescents in LMIC settings and support the development of culturally grounded, feasible, and youth-prioritized mental health strategies. Structured facilitation enhances both the inclusivity and authenticity of adolescent engagement. This study contributes to implementation science by presenting a replicable co-design framework with policy relevance and providing a foundation for multilevel intervention development in resource-constrained educational systems.

TI  - Effectiveness of a brief digitalized psychoeducational intervention in reducing mental health stigma associated with psychosis: a single-arm Singaporean pilot trial
T2  - ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF COUNSELLING AND PSYCHOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Public stigma towards psychosis constitutes a major obstacle hindering the provision of evidence-based psychotherapy. Such attitudes appear particularly concerning in South-East Asia, where people with complex mental health needs avoid seeking professional help due to high levels of stigmatization and discrimination. This study investigated the effects of a brief digitalized psychoeducational intervention on reduction of stigma associated with psychosis among young adults in Singapore. 157 participants were recruited and completed a single-arm efficacy trial. Pre- and post-intervention levels of stigma were assessed with standardized measures. Significant reduction across cognitive, attitudinal, and behavioural dimensions of stigma was achieved post-intervention. Comparing with prior studies reporting elaborate and resource-intensive public mental health education initiatives, our results suggest that similar, if not greater, outcomes might be achieved via single-session electronically delivered interventions, particularly among younger sections of Asian societies.

TI  - Research on China's adolescent mental health policies - analysis based on PMC index model
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction In recent years, the suicide rate among adolescents in China has shown a continuous upward trend, and mental health issues such as depression and excessive anxiety have become increasingly prominent. Awareness and concerns around poor mental health in adolescents is rising among the general public and in academic circles, but there is little research on adolescent mental health policies in China.Methods This article reviews the national policies on adolescent mental health from 2000 to 2023, and analyzes and evaluates the selected policy texts through the PMC index model.Results The study indicates growing national attention towards adolescent mental health policies in terms of both quantity and quality, with improved policy feasibility and synergy. However, shortcomings exist in the policy formulation process, including a lack of advocacy and supervision-oriented policies, a focus on short to medium-term effects, and inadequate comprehensive planning, hindering their swift implementation.Discussion In conclusion, facing the escalating crisis of adolescent mental health, the previous requirements of the education system are no longer sufficient. The government needs to further improve the top-down policy system, weave a safety net for mental health education and preventive intervention, and effectively promote the development of adolescent mental health.

TI  - Translation and cross-cultural adaptation of seventeen widely-used assessment instruments for child and adolescent mental health in Greece
T2  - JOURNAL OF PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIn the context of Greece, many instruments measuring constructs pertinent to child and adolescent mental health lacked a locally-validated, freely-available version. As part of a nationwide survey, we translated and cross-culturally adapted a collection of seventeen brief, largely-employed assessment tools that can be used at scale.MethodsThis study is part of the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Initiative in Greece (CAMHI), a capacity-building program focusing on enhancing mental health care for children and adolescents living in Greece. We conducted a nationwide survey assessing mental health symptoms, parenting practices, service availability and quality, mental health literacy and stigma, and professional practices within the country. As part of this process, we selected outcomes and instruments after consulting the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM) and the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN). From our selection, we identified 17 instruments that did not have a Greek-validated version available for use. These instruments were translated and cross-culturally adapted following a structured procedure, including independent back-and-forth translations, synthesis of versions, expert revision, and pilot testing. Some instruments were slightly modified to meet CAMHI survey purposes.ResultsA cross-culturally adapted version in Greek was made available for the following instruments: Pediatric Symptoms Checklist (PSC); Deliberate Self Harm Inventory (DSH) (modified); Child and Adolescent Trauma Screen-2 (CATS-2); ABCD Screen Use (modified); Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham-IV (SNAP-IV); Parent Behavior Inventory (PBI); Mental Health Literacy Scale (MHLS)-(modified); Australian Mental Health Vignettes; Reported and Intended Behavior Scale (RIBS); Barriers to Access to Care (BACE) (modified); Experience of Service Questionnaire (ESQ) (modified); and Multitheoretical List of Therapeutic Interventions (MULTI-30) (modified).ConclusionA collection of these widely-used assessment tools is now adapted for the local context and freely accessible at [https://osf.io/crz6h/]. Researchers and health professionals in Greece can utilize this resource to screen, evaluate, and monitor various constructs related to mental health in accordance with the most effective practices.

TI  - Increasing resources for autism evaluation and support for under-resourced schools through a state-wide school telehealth initiative
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY IN THE SCHOOLS
M3  - Article
AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disability affecting 1 in 44 children nationally. Timely referral to intervention and support services for ASD has consistently demonstrated significant long-term positive effects on symptoms and subsequent skills and family outcomes. This paper highlights a novel and innovative approach of short-term consultations for best practices to ultimately increase access to timely ASD evaluations and support through a state-wide school telehealth initiative. The goal of the initiative was to facilitate rapid access to ASD evaluation and support (within 2 weeks of referral in school-age youth) among under-resourced school systems in Central Texas. First, this paper provides background relative to current disparities that many children face when attempting to obtain ASD evaluations and support. Second, a statewide legislative response is described that created a mental health consortium targeting increased access to broad-based mental health services and supports, particularly in underserved areas. Next, the Texas Child Health Access Through Telemedicine (TCHATT) program is outlined with a particular focus on day-to-day operationality and concentrated efforts to increase mental health literacy among school teams relative to ASD symptoms and co-occurring behavioral health concerns. Year 1 utilization data metrics (September 2020-May 2021) and representative case examples are presented. Finally, early "lessons learned" and future directions are discussed.

TI  - Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Psychiatryand Psychology Education: Scoping Review
T2  - JMIR MEDICAL EDUCATION
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into health care, including psychiatry and psychology. In educational contexts, AI offers new possibilities for enhancing clinical reasoning, personalizing content delivery, and supporting professional development. Despite this emerging interest, a comprehensive understanding of how AI is currently used in mental health education, and the challenges associated with its adoption, remains limited. Objective: This scoping review aimed to identify and characterize current applications of AI in the teaching and learning of psychiatry and psychology. It also sought to document reported facilitators of and barriers to the integration of AI within educational contexts. Methods: A systematic search was conducted across 6 electronic databases (MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, EBM Reviews, and Google Scholar) from inception to October 2024. The review followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. Studies were included if they focused on psychiatry or psychology, described the use of an AI tool, and discussed at least 1 facilitator of or barrier to its use in education. Data were extracted on study characteristics, population, AI application, educational outcomes, facilitators, and barriers. Study quality was appraised using several design-appropriate tools. Results: From 6219 records, 10 (0.2%) studies met the inclusion criteria. Eight categories of AI applications were identified: clinical decision support, educational content creation, therapeutic toolsand mental health monitoring, administrative and research assistance, natural language processing (NLP), program/policy development, students' study aid, and professional development. Key facilitators included the availability of AI tools, positive learner attitudes, digital infrastructure, and time-saving features. Barriers included limited AI training, ethical concerns, lack of digital literacy, algorithmic opacity, and insufficient curricular integration. The overall methodological quality of included studieswas moderate to high. Conclusions:AI is being used across a range of educational functions in psychiatry and psychology, from clinical training to assessment and administrative support. Although the potential for enhancing learning outcomes is clear, its successful integration requires addressing ethical, technical, and pedagogical barriers. Future efforts should focus on AI literacy, faculty development, and institutional policies to guide responsible and effective use. This review underscores the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration to ensure the safe, equitable, and meaningful adoption of AI in mental health education.

TI  - Technology-Based Interventions to Improve Help-Seeking for Mental Health Concerns: A Systematic Review
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Despite the high prevalence of mental health disorders worldwide, a significant proportion of distressed individuals do not seek professional help. Digital technology can be a potential bridge to reduce the treatment gap for mental disorders. A systematic review was undertaken to examine the technology-based interventions aimed at improving help-seeking attitude, intention, or behavior for mental health concerns. Methods: The literature search was conducted in January-February 2020 through various e-databases using relevant keywords that targeted help-seeking interventions for mental health disorders via different technology modes. Results: 21 studies (15 randomized controlled trials and six non-randomized studies) were reviewed. The included studies were published between April 2006 to February 2020. Majority of the interventions led to an increase in the help-seeking variables. The crucial role of online delivery, participant involvement, and embedded links to professional services in encouraging help-seeking is highlighted. The review emphasizes the need for understanding utility of multicomponent interventions with personalized elements targeting help-seeking behavior, particularly in low-middle-income countries, and studies involving longer duration follow-ups. Conclusion: This systematic review is the first of its kind to examine technology-based interventions to improve help-seeking for mental health and suggests that such interventions play a crucial role in positively impacting help-seeking. The complex interplay between the relevant variables such as mental health literacy, stigma, help-seeking attitude, intention and behavior, and the intervention components that may have a differential bearing on these variables are issues that merit urgent attention in further research.

T2  - FAMILIES IN SOCIETY-THE JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY SOCIAL SERVICES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Mental health discourse on social media is reshaping the therapeutic relationship between service consumers and social workers. This qualitative study examines social work therapists' perspectives on how social media influences the therapeutic process. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 29 social workers providing psychotherapy. Using a narrative inquiry approach, the study explored therapists' experiences with clients' increasing engagement with social media. Key themes included (a) social media's role in normalizing and destigmatizing mental health conditions, (b) shifting client expectations as "therapy consumers" shaped by online interactions, and (c) the challenges of misinformation as therapists navigate clients' self-diagnosis and misdiagnosis. The study concludes with recommendations for integrating digital literacy, critical thinking, and a balanced approach to social media's influence within therapeutic practice.

TI  - Simulated Patient Role-Plays with Consumers with Lived Experience of Mental Illness Post-Mental Health First Aid Training: Interrater and Test Re-Test Reliability of an Observed Behavioral Assessment Rubric
T2  - PHARMACY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) training teaches participants how to assist people experiencing mental health problems and crises. Observed behavioral assessments, post-training, are lacking, and the literature largely focuses on self-reported measurement of behaviors and confidence. This study explores the reliability of an observed behavioral assessment rubric used to assess pharmacy students during simulated patient (SP) role-play assessments with mental health consumers. Post-MHFA training, pharmacy students (n = 528) participated in SP role-play assessments (n = 96) of six mental health cases enacted by consumers with lived experience of mental illness. Each assessment was marked by the tutor, participating student, and consumer (three raters). Non-parametric tests were used to compare raters' means scores and pass/fail categories. Interrater reliability analyses were conducted for overall scores, as well as pass/fail categories using intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and Fleiss' Kappa, respectively. Test re-test reliability analyses were conducted using Pearson's correlation. For interrater reliability analyses, the intra-class correlation coefficient varied from poor-to-good to moderate-to-excellent for individual cases but was moderate-to-excellent for combined cases (0.70; CI 0.58-0.80). Fleiss' Kappa varied across cases but was fair-to-good for combined cases (0.57, p < 0.001). For test re-test reliability analyses, Pearson's correlation was strong for individual and combined cases (0.87; p < 0.001). Recommended modifications to the rubric, including the addition of barrier items, scoring guides, and specific examples, as well as the creation of new case-specific rubric versions, may improve reliability. The rubric can be used to facilitate the measurement of actual, observed behaviors post-MHFA training in pharmacy and other health care curricula.

TI  - Addressing the Increasing Mental Health Distress and Mental Illness Among Young Adults in the United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF NERVOUS AND MENTAL DISEASE
M3  - Review
AB  - Recent surveys show rising numbers of young people who report anxiety and depression. Although much attention has focused on mental health of adolescent youth, less attention has been paid to young people as they transition into adulthood. Multiple factors may have contributed to this steady increase: greater exposure to social media, information, and distressing news via personal electronic devices; increased concerns regarding social determinants of health and climate change; and changing social norms due to increased mental health literacy and reduced stigma. The COVID-19 pandemic may have temporarily exacerbated symptoms and impacted treatment availability. Strategies to mitigate causal factors for depression and anxiety in young adults may include education and skills training for cognitive, behavioral, and social coping strategies, as well as healthier use of technology and social media. Policies must support the availability of health insurance and treatment, and clinicians can adapt interventions to encompass the specific concerns and needs of young adults.

TI  - Cultivating mental health education in obstetrics and gynecology: a call to action
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY MFM
M3  - Review
AB  - Mental health disorders are common and have a significantly negative impact on the health and well-being of women. For example, perinatal mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression are widely understood to be the most common complications of pregnancy and childbirth. Untreated mental health disorders are associated with significant obstetrical and psychiatric sequelae and have a long-lasting impact on neonatal and childhood outcomes. As front-line providers for women during times of elevated risk of psychiatric morbidity, such as pregnancy and postpartum, obstetricians and gynecologists are compelled to have familiarity with such disorders. Yet, a wide gap exists between the level of education in mental health disorders that obstetrician and gynecologist providers receive and the clinical need thereof. The objectives of this commentary are to describe the urgent need for mental health education for obstetricians and gynecologists providers and to introduce our vision for a concise, evidencebased and accessible set of digital educational materials designed to convey core concepts in women's reproductive mental health.

TI  - Intervention of adolescent? mental health during the outbreak of COVID-19 using aerobic exercise combined with acceptance and commitment therapy
T2  - CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To explore the intervention effect of aerobic exercise in combination with acceptance and commitment therapy on mental health of adolescents during the outbreak of COVID-19 based on the theory of the dual-factor model of mental health. Methodology: 1200 adolescents aged 12?19 in Fujian Province, China were screened by means of the dual-factor model of mental health from March to April 2020. 30 vulnerable, 30 symptomatic but contented and 30 distressed adolescents were selected as the experiment objects, and these 3 types of adolescents were randomly divided into the intervention group and the control group. Among them, the intervention group received 8 weeks of aerobic exercise in combination with acceptance and commitment therapy, 3 times a week, about 40?60 min each time. The control group, however, didn?t receive any intervention other than routine mental health education. Measurements were made before and after the intervention. Results: (1) For vulnerable, symptomatic but contented and distressed individuals, before the intervention, there is no significant difference between the intervention group and the control group in terms of psychological distress, well-being and psychological flexibility (P 0.05), but there are no significant differences in the control group (P 0.05). Conclusion: Attention should be paid to the problems of mental health of adolescents caused by the sudden outbreak of public health incidents. Aerobic exercise in combination with acceptance and commitment therapy is feasible and effective for the intervention in mental health of adolescents.

TI  - Health-care undergraduate student's attitudes towards mental illness following anti-stigma education: a critical review of the literature
T2  - JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH TRAINING EDUCATION AND PRACTICE
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose There has been growing awareness underpinned with legislative recognition of the need to reduce the stigma attached to mental health. Education is seen as an integral factor for this endeavour. The purpose of this paper is to review existing literature to determine both positive and negative attitudinal changes of health-care-related undergraduate students towards mental illness after a training intervention within higher education. Design/methodology/approach A search of papers written in the English Language was conducted between 2004 and 2021, using CINAHL, Eric, Educational Research Complete, Medline, psychINFO and SocIndex. Search terms used were undergraduate, attitudes or perceptions, mental illness/mental ill health, education, stigma and students. Findings In total, 24 studies were critically reviewed, which included experimental, descriptive and exploratory designs. The appraisal of papers used recognised evaluation tools to review the methodological quality. Findings suggest that overall, anti-stigma education has a significant positive effect for student attitudinal change. Research limitations/implications Mental health anti-stigma education is beneficial for changing attitudes, however, more bio-medically framed training is less powerful for initiating change. Learning from those with the lived experience appears to have a more sustainable impact as indicated in some of the studies. There is a need for more exploratory research to gain further knowledge on the critical educational mechanisms that may foster more long-term reframing of positive attitudes towards mental health. Practical implications Training providers need to consider the compelling evidence base surrounding anti-stigma pedagogy that supports the use of individuals with experience of mental ill health within the educational processes. Social implications Mental health stigma has potential for profound negative impact on individuals and at a wider societal level. Education is central to enable learners to consider their attitudes to mental illness to reduce stigmatising attitudes. Students on health-care-related courses are influential in becoming catalysts for change. Originality/value This paper has critically reviewed the literature examining the attitudes of health-care-related undergraduate students following anti-stigma education, offering insights into some of positive and negative attitudinal changes and opinions of the event. In particular contributing to an understanding on the important components for eradicating the stigma surrounding mental health.

AB  - Telehealth allows access to high-quality, holistic patient care, including diagnosis, interventions, treatments, monitoring, and patient education. As the use of telehealth continues to increase, faculty considered the need for entry-level nursing students to be introduced to telehealth and its services. Faculty from the medical-surgical II and mental health courses developed a learning experience for students that blends concepts from both courses, as patients often present with multiple problems. The telehealth experience helped students utilize assessment skills, learn delegation, and connect concepts from two courses to provide care for a patient remotely.

AB  - This mixed -method research addresses two problems: 1) the need to understand more deeply the lived experiences of individuals with mental illness to inform the design of a virtual serious game (VSG) and; 2) the need for more accessible and interactive mental health VSGs for nursing student learning before attending community placements. We began with an Ontario wide collection of individual narratives about living with mental illness using qualitative methods and then applied the findings in two ways. First, we incorporated the person centered feedback into the serious VSGs' storyline, and secondly, we developed and refined the VSG prototype. Next, we will implement the VSG into the nursing curriculum for evaluation of learning outcomes.

TI  - Recommendation Optimization of Physical Education for Developing the Intelligence of Autistic Children following Intelligent Collaborative Filtering Algorithm
T2  - MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Autism, a developmental disorder affecting social and communication skills, differs from most the mental handicap in showing a characteristic pattern of poor, intact, and even superior cognitive abilities. This study aims to solve the mismatch of the teaching content and mental health education for autistic children. Inspired by artificial intelligence, an improved neural network matrix factorization (NeuMF) model is designed based on the theory of collaborative filtering, and time data is added to improve the NeuMF by using the K-means clustering algorithm. Several evaluation indexes such as root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are selected to assess the performance of the proposed model. Results show that RMSE and MAE of the improved NeuMF model are 1.251 and 0.625, respectively, which are better than collaborative filtering and traditional neural network factorization models. Moreover, the proposed model is used to recommend the activities of physical education (PE) for developing the intelligence of autistic children. This proves that the optimized model has better performance and can be used to recommend online courses for autistic users. This dynamic personalized curriculum recommendations model can help autistic children recover in a short time.

TI  - Types and effectiveness of mental health promotion programmes for young people in sub-Saharan Africa: A systematic review
T2  - CAMBRIDGE PRISMS-GLOBAL MENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Studies show that mental health promotion is an effective strategy that can reduce the burden of mental health disorders and improve overall well-being in both children and adults. In addition to promoting high levels of mental well-being and preventing the onset of mental illness, these mental health promotion programmes, including mental illness prevention interventions, help increase levels of mental health literacy in community members. While there is evidence showing the effectiveness of mental health promotion, much of what is known about this field is informed by studies conducted in high-income countries. There is a need to gather evidence about the effectiveness of such interventions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where mental health services are often inadequate. In this systematic review, we synthesised the available published primary evidence from sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) on the types and effectiveness of mental health promotion programmes for young people. We performed a search of selected global databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, ScienceDirect and Google Scholar) and regional databases (Sabinet African Journals). We included observational, mixed methods, trials, pilots and quantitative original papers published from 2013 to 2023. We used the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) to evaluate the quality of methods in selected studies, and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement (PRISMA-2020) for reporting the evidence gathered. We identified 15 types of youth mental health promotion and illness prevention interventions. Among those identified, we found that school-based interventions enhanced mental health literacy, mental health-seeking behaviours and self-assurance and confidence among young people. Family-based interventions also showed a potential to improve relationships between young people and their caregivers. Future studies should explore how to further strengthen school- and family-based interventions that promote mental health among young people.

AB  - The emotional problem is one of many causes of a decrease in self-esteem in adolescents. This study aimed to determine the relationship between emotional problems with self-esteem in adolescents. The study used a descriptive correlative design with two sampling techniques; purposive sampling and stratified-cluster sampling. The research consisted of 268 high school adolescents in South Jakarta. Data were obtain using two questionnaires; Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire and the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory. The majority of high school adolescents in South Jakarta have a moderate level of self-esteem of 54.9%. The emotional problems that adolescents have been within the normal range at 69%. Emotional problems have a significant relationship with self-esteem in adolescents. This research is expected to be the foundation for various promotion and prevention programs, such as leadership training, extracurricular activities, cognitive behavioral therapy, emotional intelligence training, group counseling, and mental health education.

TI  - The effect of a low intensity intervention on the wellbeing of children in the juvenile justice system in India: Results from a pilot study
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Children in the Juvenile Justice System (JJS) face multiple adversities that may predispose them to developing mental health (MH) problems. Interventions that enhance the MH and well-being of these children while providing access to appropriate MH care are needed. This study examines the effect of a multipronged, low-intensity intervention on adolescents' well-being, stress levels, MH knowledge, and stigma perceptions in Childcare Institutions (CCIs) across Odisha and Tamil Nadu, India. Methods Implemented in 7 CCIs, the intervention aimed to enhance the MH Literacy (MHL) and well-being of children in the CCIs through the Youth-Friendly Spaces (YFS) using experiential methods. It also sought to improve the MHL of the staff and administration within the JJS and provide access to MH care by linking CCIs to available local resources. Information using validated scales was obtained at baseline and six months. Results Only 180 of the 310 children for whom baseline data was available remained in the CCI at six months. A statistically significant improvement in well-being (34.5 +13.7-55.9 +12.2, p < 0.001), stress (18.5 +6.8-17 +6.1, p = 0.044) and stigma (32 +11.9-29.4 +11.4, p = 0.023) scores were observed. Adjusted linear regression analysis showed significant differences across genders, sites, and child types. Discussion This intervention, comprising YFS creation, MHL enhancement, and referral system development, is significantly associated with improved well-being of children in CCIs. The results underscore the need for tailored interventions based on gender, location, and child type. The study highlights the potential scalability of such programs in resource-constrained settings for vulnerable children.

T2  - MIDWIFERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim/Objective: This study aims to explore and evaluate postgraduate student experiences of a perinatal mental health education programme and to explore the value of collaborative learning within an interprofessional group. Background: Evidence highlights the need for accessible mental health care during the perinatal period from educated and skilled healthcare professionals. Until recently, there has been a lack of emphasis on perinatal mental health care provision and a subsequent lack of education and training in the area for healthcare professionals. Design: A qualitative descriptive research study was conducted to evaluate an interprofessional approach to perinatal mental health education. Participants: A purposive sample of postgraduate healthcare professionals (n = 10) who completed the first year of the Master of Science in Perinatal Mental Health programme or who had completed relevant standalone modules, at a Higher Education Institute in Ireland, participated in the study. Methods: Data collection were conducted via four online small-group discussions and thematic analysis was utilised to analyse the narrative data. Results: Three themes illustrate participants' experiences of the perinatal mental health programme: Learning with other professionals, Enhanced confidence for clinical practice and Challenges of the programme. Conclusion: By undertaking the perinatal mental health programme/modules participants were provided with opportunities to engage in interprofessional education. The programme offered opportunities for developing networking relationships which continued into clinical practice. Participants acknowledged the benefits of the programme in acquiring specialist knowledge and skills regarding the spectrum of perinatal mental health enhancing clinical assessment, communication, and confidence in care provision.

TI  - A cluster randomised controlled trial of a web-based youth mental health service in Australian schools
T2  - LANCET REGIONAL HEALTH-WESTERN PACIFIC
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Secondary schools have attempted to address gaps in help-seeking for mental health problems with little success. This trial evaluated the effectiveness of a universal web-based service (Smooth Sailing) for improving help-seeking intentions for mental health problems and other related outcomes among students.Methods: A cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the 12-week outcomes of the Smooth Sailing service among 1841 students from 22 secondary schools in New South Wales, Australia. Assignment was conducted at the school level. The control condition received school-as-usual. The primary outcome was help-seeking intentions for general mental health problems at 12-weeks post-baseline. Secondary outcomes included help-seeking behaviour, anxiety and depressive symptoms, psychological distress, psychological barriers to help-seeking, and mental health literacy. Data were analysed using mixed linear models. This trial was registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12618001539224).Findings: At 12-weeks post-baseline, there was a marginal statistical difference in the relative means of help-seeking intentions (effect size=0.10, 95%CI: -0.02-0.21) that favoured the intervention condition. Help-seeking from adults declined in both conditions. There was a greater reduction in the number of students who "needed support for their mental health but were not seeking help" in the intervention condition (OR: 2.08, 95%CI: 1.72-2.27, P<.0001). No other universal effects were found. Participants found the service easy to use and understand; However, low motivation, time, forgetfulness, and lack of perceived need were barriers to use.Interpretation: Smooth Sailing led to small improvements in help-seeking intentions. Refinements are needed to improve its effectiveness on other mental health outcomes and to increase student uptake and engagement. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Reconnecting Homeless Adolescents and Their Families: Correlates of Participation in a Family Intervention
T2  - PREVENTION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Behavioral family interventions are an effective way to intervene to prevent negative developmental outcomes for adolescents. Participation in family interventions encompasses behavioral and cognitive/attitudinal dimensions, among others, indicated by retention and engagement, respectively. Two dimensions of participation, retention and engagement, in a family intervention were examined in a sample of newly homeless adolescents and their parents or guardians. Correlates of participation included parents with more income and less perceived family conflict and adolescents with higher endorsement of depression, anxiety, somatization, obsessive-compulsive, phobic, and psychotic symptoms on the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). Stronger therapeutic alliance was correlated with being more distressed (i.e., lower income, more hostility), being a female adolescent participant, and having greater comfort discussing sex with parents. Furthermore, parents and adolescents with greater distress and thus greater need were more apt to finish the intervention. The finding that families who were experiencing more distress had higher alliance scores suggests that there is an additional need for development of interventions for families in crisis. Both participant and provider perceptions are also important in development of a strong therapeutic alliance. This study's findings have implications for further exploration of the development of cultural humility and improving mental health literacy among facilitators of behavioral interventions.

AB  - Financial, environmental, and socio-cultural challenges affect the mental health and wellbeing of those working and living on-farm. Education programs can help in improving mental health and overall wellbeing, but most of these programs are offered to established farmers in a face-to-face format, leading to a gap in offerings to many subgroups, including young agricultural entrants. To address these gaps, this paper assesses the value of an online mental health and resilience education program for young agricultural entrants. An explanatory sequential mixed methods approach was applied. Firstly, a quantitative survey was conducted with 172 first year agricultural tertiary students, aged 18-20, to assess the knowledge and skills gained due to program participation. Regressions and propensity score matching were used to determine the effect of program participation. Subsequently, seven interviews were conducted with program participants to provide insights into their experiences of the program. Thematic coding was applied to analyze the qualitative data. Findings from the quantitative survey show a significant increase in mental health knowledge and skills amongst program participants compared to participants in the control group. The qualitative interviews show the ability to work through the material in their own time and space, creates a safe environment for online students. Other mechanisms contributing to learning are using "normal language", a peer voice in communicating wellbeing, and building on learnings in previous education. This paper addresses a gap in literature by being the first study to evaluate online mental health education for agricultural tertiary students. It provides educators and other program designers with valuable information for future program design to support the wellbeing of young agricultural workers.

TI  - Data_Sheet_1_Health Literacy Needs Among Unemployed Persons: Collating Evidence Through Triangulation of Interview and Scoping Review Data.ZIP
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data set
AB  - BackgroundUnemployed persons are at high risk for low health literacy. Most studies addressing health literacy of unemployed persons focus on risk factors for low health literacy or correlates of health literacy, but studies on needs of unemployed persons regarding health literacy are scarce. We aimed to obtain better understanding of health literacy needs of unemployed adults by triangulating the results from a scoping review on health literacy needs in unemployed adults and additional in-depth qualitative interviews.MethodsScoping review: We searched six databases up to January 2021 as well as gray literature for relevant studies following PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Titles, abstracts, and full texts were screened independently by two researchers. Qualitative study: Ten participants of a job-reintegration program in Germany were interviewed following a guideline covering topics including health issues of interest to the participants, their sources of health-related information and the barriers/facilitators they experience when accessing health services.ResultsScoping review: After screening 2,966 titles and abstracts, 36 full texts were considered, and five articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Four focused on mental health literacy and outcomes, while the fifth assessed information-seeking practices. One additional report on health literacy was identified via the gray literature search. Awareness of one's condition was identified as a facilitator for mental health help-seeking, while fear of harmful effects of medication prevented help-seeking. Qualitative study: Participants were interested in and were generally well-informed about health topics such as nutrition and physical activity. The main challenge perceived was translating the knowledge into practice in daily life. GPs and the social services providers played an important role as a source of health information and advice. Regarding mental health, similar barriers, facilitators and needs were identified through triangulation of findings of the scoping review with those of the interviews.ConclusionsThere is need to address health literacy needs of long-term unemployed persons that go beyond mental health literacy. Public health interventions should not only aim at improving health literacy scores, but also focus on how to help participants translate health literacy into practice. Population groups of interest should also be involved in all processes of designing interventions. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) is designed to help the general public acquire the knowledge and skills needed to respond to a person in a mental health emergency and offer support to someone in emotional distress. Through the PA Foundation's Mental Health Outreach Fellowship, 16 physician assistants (PAs) were selected to become MHFA instructors and teach the course to members of their local communities over 1 year.Methods: MHFA course evaluations, completed by course participants, were reviewed to determine the effectiveness of the PA fellows as instructors.Results: The fellows' mean evaluation instructor presentation score was 4.82 and the mean course content score was 4.75. The national mean for instructor presentation was 4.72 for presentation and 4.66 for course content. The maximum possible score in each category was a 5.Conclusions: The PAs selected for the Mental Health Outreach Fellowship were effective MHFA instructors. Benefits to having a PA serve as the instructor include positively affecting communities by increasing the public's mental health literacy, reducing the stigma associated with mental illness, increasing visibility and promotion of the PA profession, and enhancement of a PA's individual career through education and service.

TI  - Design of an Integrated System of Psychological Health Education Resources for Vocational Students Using Fuzzy Clustering Algorithm Analysis (Retracted Article)
T2  - SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
M3  - Article
M3  - Retracted Publication
AB  - Mental health is an important part of the growth of students. Many mental health monitoring systems have many problems. When the resource capacity is large, traditional systems have problems such as poor stability, more resource fragments, and untimely system response. For this reason, this paper designs a system of mental health education resource integration for higher vocational students based on a fuzzy clustering algorithm. It builds the overall system architecture based on the SOA service architecture and designs each functional module of the system so that the system has the functions of teaching resource submission, resource audit management, user service, and resource storage. The density function method is used to initialize the initial resource clustering center to obtain the data clustering objective function, and the fuzzy clustering algorithm is used to establish the task model to realize the integration of the mental health education resources of the vocational students. System verification results show that the system has strong stability, fewer node resource fragments, and higher resource integration efficiency.

TI  - Common mental health conditions and considerations in pediatric chronic kidney disease
T2  - PEDIATRIC NEPHROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The mental health of youth with chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been increasingly recognized as an area of clinical need. The development of mental health concerns is influenced by a range of physiological, psychological, and environmental factors. Some of these factors are common across child development, but some are more unique to youth with CKD. Mental health concerns are associated with increased risk for a range of poor medical outcomes (e.g., adherence, risk of transplant rejection) and quality of life concerns. In this educational review, we discuss the current evidence base regarding the development of mental health concerns in youth with CKD. The review covers multiple domains including mood and anxiety disorders, traumatic stress, and neurodevelopmental disorders. Estimated prevalence and hypothesized risk factors are outlined, and the potential impact of mental health on medical care and functional outcomes are reviewed. Finally, we introduce options for intervention to support positive mental health and offer recommendations for building access to mental health care and improving the mental health education/training of medical professionals.Graphical abstract"A higher resolution version of the Graphical abstract is available as Supplementary information"

TI  - The role of professional football clubs in enhancing young people's mental health: a mixed-method survey of interventions delivered by English Football League Trusts
T2  - PERSPECTIVES IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Aims: Football Club Community Trusts (FCCTs) that are attached to professional football clubs in the UK use the sport brand to engage marginalised populations in various initiatives designed to address public health agendas. Studies highlight the impact that FCCTs can have on adults' mental health, yet less is known about programmes for young people under 18 years. This study is the first to identify the mental health-focussed interventions for young people that are delivered by the FCCTs in the English Football League (EFL), including the key programme features and challenges to implementation.Methods: A 60-item mixed-method survey was sent to all 70 FCCTs in the EFL during the 2018-2019 season in September 2018. In total, 54 (77.1%) FCCTs responded.Results: In total, 21 FCCTs were delivering mental health-focused interventions to young people and 23 different initiatives were identified. Reported aims included promoting resilience (n = 19/21, 90.5%) and self-esteem (n = 19/21, 90.5%), as well as identifying young people at risk of developing a mental health problem (n = 9/21, 42.9%). However, features of individual programmes varied. Some used football to increase social inclusion and overall wellbeing, whereas others included education sessions to improve mental health literacy (e.g. anti-stigma, strategies to promote mental health). FCCTs also reported challenges with evaluating their own interventions, sustaining funding, and keeping up to date with mental health training.Conclusions: This study contributes to the limited literature on professional sport club community trust interventions, highlighting the value of programmes targeting children and young people's mental health. FCCT programmes align with mental health promotion and prevention policy, by providing opportunities to participate in physical activity (PA), develop mental health literacy, and identify young people at risk of developing mental health problems. Collaboration with organisations with expertise in service evaluation, audit, and research is essential to support FCCTs in evaluating their impact and demonstrating the significance of their work.

TI  - Embedding lived experience expertise across the mental health tertiary education sector: An integrative review in the context of Aotearoa New Zealand
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC AND MENTAL HEALTH NURSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Accessible SummaryWhat is known on the subject?An important step towards improving mental health outcomes is the realignment of tertiary mental health education and research in a way which places strategic value on experience-driven involvement in mental health and addiction-related care.One of the most widely recognized ways of achieving this is by increasing representation of individuals with first-hand experience of mental health and addiction distress (also known or referred to as Experts by Experience or EBE) within the tertiary sector.What this paper adds to existing knowledge?Benefits of tertiary EBE representation such as improving student's preparedness for practice and the empowerment of mental health consumers are consistently reported throughout the literature. In striving towards these outcomes, it is crucial we remain mindful of relevant and often-reported hurdles such as stigma and improper implementation.By using Aotearoa New Zealand as a case study, the need for approaches to increasing EBE representation which is conscious of diverse cultural contexts, perspectives and identities is highlighted.What are the implications for practice?This review draws together a broad range of factors associated with improving clinical practice. These include the potential for EBE representation to improve outcomes for trainee clinicians, and the incorporation of consumer-driven perspectives into evidence-based practice.This review further highlights the need for EBE representation to be implemented in a way which is responsive to the cultural needs and nuances of mental health education and practice in Aotearoa New Zealand, and, similarly in other countries.IntroductionThere is potential value in increasing representation of expert by experience (EBE) involvement in mental health education sectors. This approach to improving mental health outcomes is here explored in the context of Aotearoa New Zealand's tertiary education sector.Aim/QuestionThis review sought to identify potential outcomes, benefits and barriers associated with EBE representation in tertiary institutions, whilst critically analysing these strategies in the context of Aotearoa New Zealand's mental health education sector.MethodData retrieved from electronic databases were subjected to critical appraisal and thematic analysis. The integrative review drew from a final data set of 113 articles.ResultsAn integrative review of our search results indicated that moving towards a tertiary mental health model in which lived experience plays a central role has the potential to benefit both teaching and research in the tertiary sector.DiscussionThe interplay between contemporary perspectives on tertiary EBE representation and the cultural needs and nuances of Aotearoa New Zealand's tertiary sector highlights the need for critical and careful approaches to EBE representation.Implications for clinical practiceFindings surrounding tertiary EBE representation have direct implications for the training of mental health practitioners and the evaluation and development of clinical practice outcomes and procedures.

TI  - Knowledge and attitudes of Dutch psychiatry residents towards anorexia nervosa
T2  - JOURNAL OF EATING DISORDERS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundStigma significantly hinders treatment seeking, adherence to treatment, referrals, and can prolong recovery, while increasing the risk of relapse due to social exclusion and stress. Stigmatizing attitudes towards anorexia nervosa are widespread, and not only held by the general public, but also by professionals.ObjectiveAs stigmatizing attitudes towards mental disorders often develop early during education and training, the study's objective was to investigate stigmatizing attitudes towards anorexia nervosa among Dutch psychiatry residents, as well as their mental health literacy.MethodsIn this pilot study, Dutch psychiatry residents (N = 61) were surveyed, with a 49% response rate, using a comprehensive questionnaire that included nine parts, covering multiple stigma domains, disease prestige, knowledge, and professional training.ResultsAnorexia nervosa was ranked 18th in disease prestige with a mean score of 6.23. Although most stigmatizing attitudes were not widely endorsed by psychiatry residents, there were a few notable exceptions, especially attitudes related to blame, fragility and social distance. They characterized patients as insecure, controlling, sad, and defensive, and reported feeling worried, incompetent, pessimistic and anxious when dealing with patients with anorexia nervosa. Only 37% felt confident in diagnosing anorexia nervosa.ConclusionThere is a critical need for further research on the social value ranking of psychiatric disorders and the development of a comprehensive stigma scale, as well as targeted educational interventions. Addressing stigma through focused training programs could lead to better patient outcomes, improved treatment satisfaction, and reduced barriers to care for individuals with anorexia nervosa.

TI  - Exploring the perspectives of young adults on mental healthcare and systemic health, education, and social challenges in Australia: a qualitative study
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Young people often face significant challenges accessing effective mental health support as they navigate through complex healthcare systems, education pathways, and social pressures. Understanding the service-level barriers they encounter is critical to improving mental health system design and delivery. While previous studies have examined individual barriers to mental healthcare access, few have adopted a cross-sectorial, youth-informed approach which captures the interrelated structural, institutional, and socio-cultural factors influencing young people's mental health experiences. Methods Seventeen participants aged 18-24 years with lived experience of depression and/or anxiety participated in nine in-person focus groups and interviews in Perth. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to identify systemic barriers and facilitators to mental healthcare, with a particular focus on access, care coordination, therapeutic engagement, and service responsiveness. Results Key themes included fragmented care pathways, inadequate provider follow-up, prolonged wait times, financial constraints, lack of youth-specific mental health training among clinicians, and limited therapeutic rapport. Participants also described inadequate mental health literacy within schools and persistent stigma in social and familial settings. These intersecting barriers hindered access, disrupted continuity of care, and undermined trust in the mental health system. Conclusions Findings highlight critical inefficiencies in mental health service delivery for young Australians. Policy responses should prioritise integrated care models, investment in multidisciplinary youth mental health hubs, improved school-based mental health literacy, and culturally inclusive anti-stigma initiatives to promote access, trust, and continuity of care.

T2  - ADVANCES IN MENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - ObjectiveThis study aimed to assess the effectiveness of two intervention strategies, Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (ICBT) and Cognitive Bias Modification for Help-Seeking (CBM-HS), in modifying young, rural Australians' mental health help-seeking stigma to increase intentions to access mental health care within Australia.MethodA total of 42 young people (aged between 15 and 24 years) participated in a three-armed randomised trial, with participants randomly allocated into one of the two interventions or the control condition. Data were collected pre-, post-, and at six weeks follow-up via self-report questionnaires. Main outcome measures: mental health help-seeking self-stigma, perceived public stigma, attitudes, and intentions to seek mental health help.ResultsThe results provided some support for the CBM-HS intervention as effective in decreasing self-stigma across the three time points compared to the other conditions. No significant effects were observed in the ICBT intervention. A significant increase in mean mental health literacy scores was also found between time points across all conditions.ConclusionsThese findings suggest that online anti-stigma interventions could feasibly be used to reduce help-seeking stigma among young rural Australians, which may help to increase the proportions of individuals seeking help for their mental health concerns.

TI  - Drafting the Aboriginal and Islander Mental Health Initiative for Youth (AIMhi-Y) App: Results of a formative mixed methods study
T2  - INTERNET INTERVENTIONS-THE APPLICATION OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN MENTAL AND BEHAVIOURAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Culturally responsive, strengths-based early-intervention mental health treatment programs are considered most appropriate to influence the high rates of psychological distress and suicide experienced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth. Few early intervention services effectively bridge the socio-cultural and geographic challenges of providing sufficient and culturally relevant services in rural and remote Australia. Mental Health apps provide an opportunity to bridge current gaps in service access if co-designed with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth to meet their needs.Aims: This paper reports the results of the formative stage of the AIMhi-Y App development process which engaged Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth in the co-design of the new culturally informed AIMhi-Y App.Methods: Using a participatory design research approach, a series of co-design workshops were held across three sites with five groups of young people. Workshops explored concepts, understanding, language, acceptability of electronic mental health tools (e-mental health) and identified important characteristics of the presented applications and websites, chosen for relevance to this group. An additional peer supported online survey explored use of technology, help seeking and e-mental health design elements which contribute to acceptability.Results: Forty-five, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth, aged 10-18 years, from three sites in the Northern Territory (NT) were involved in the workshops (n = 29). Although experiencing psychological distress, participants faced barriers to help seeking. Apps were perceived as a potential solution to overcome barriers by increasing mental health literacy, providing anonymity if desired, and linking young people with further help. Preferred app characteristics included a strength-based approach, mental health information, relatable content and a fun, appealing, easy to use interface which encouraged app progression. Findings informed the new AIMhi-Y App draft, which is a strengths-based early intervention wellbeing app for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth.Conclusions: Research findings highlight the need, feasibility and potential of these types of tools, from the perspective of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth.

TI  - Examining the Efficacy of Large Language Models for Mitigating Depression and Anxiety Among Chinese Students
T2  - CIN-COMPUTERS INFORMATICS NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Secondary school students undergo significant psychological and physiological changes during adolescence, increasing their vulnerability to mental health issues. However, existing mental health services are inadequate to address the growing demand. To bridge this gap, we developed WarmGPT, a conversational mental health service robot utilizing a large language model integrated with cognitive- behavioral therapy, aimed at supporting secondary school students. In this study, 40 students from a Chinese secondary school were randomly assigned to an experimental group or a control group. The experimental group received 2 weeks of counseling through WarmGPT, whereas the control group viewed mental health education videos. Emotional states were evaluated before and after the intervention using scales measuring depression, anxiety, and positive and negative affect. Results indicated that the large language model-based WarmGPT significantly reduced depression, anxiety, and negative emotions and increased positive emotions among the students, outperforming the control group. These findings suggest that large language model-based conversational agents such as WarmGPT are effective in alleviating negative emotions and enhancing overall mental health in secondary school students, offering a promising new approach for mental health interventions.

TI  - Effects of a Group Counseling Intervention Model Grounded on Character Strengths Theory on Inferiority Complex in Adolescents
T2  - IRANIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Inferiority complex is a common psychological disorder occurring in adolescents during their psychological development and the root cause of most psychological problems. However, inferiority complex in adolescents has rarely been examined in previous intervention studies. This practice-oriented study combined character strengths theory with group psychological counseling to examine adolescents with high inferiority complex scores. Methods: A survey was conducted on 512 adolescents selected using convenience sampling from three middle schools in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, to collect information regarding the degree and characteristics of their inferiority complex. Those with a high inferiority complex score were recruited for a grouped experiment, where the experiment group received group counseling grounded on character strengths theory. Results: The participants had a moderately high degree of inferiority complex (mean = 2.92). Significant differences were observed in the total inferiority complex score across gender, left-behind experience, and academic performance (P < 0.05). After the intervention, the inferiority complex score of the experiment group was significantly lower than that of the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (P< 0.05). Conclusion: The intervention model constructed in this study effectively reduces inferiority complex in adolescents, providing a reference for exploring an effective approach to adolescent-targeted mental health education.

TI  - Development and Evaluation of Online Suicide Preventive Tool iAlive to Increase Competences in Engaging With a Suicidal Person Nonrandomized Controlled Trial
T2  - CRISIS-THE JOURNAL OF CRISIS INTERVENTION AND SUICIDE PREVENTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Online implementation of suicide prevention interventions offers many advantages, facilitating the dissemination of large-scale suicide prevention interventions. An online tool iAlive aimed at raising awareness and increasing suicide prevention competences in lay people was developed and implemented in Slovenia. Aims: To develop, implement, and evaluate the iAlive tool. Method: Following the development and implementation of the tool, a nonrandomized controlled study with 310 participants was conducted. One hundred fifty-six of them fully completed the study [intervention group (used the iAlive tool): N = 85, control group (did not use the tool): N = 71]. Perceived competences in engaging with a suicidal person were assessed in both groups at baseline and at follow-up (3-4 weeks apart), which also represents the time of the intervention. Results: A significant effect of time and condition [F(1,149) = 6.62, p = .011, eta(2)(p) = .043] showed that the intervention group assessed their perceived competences on intervention exposure more positively compared to the control group. Limitations: Additional data on different populations and people's engagement with the tool in relation to perceived competences are needed. Conclusion: The study suggests that the interactive online tool iAlive effectively increases perceived competences in engaging with a suicidal person. These results provide a background for further dissemination of the tool.

TI  - Digital Mental Health Interventions for Young People in Rural South Africa: Prospects and Challenges for Implementation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, most young people living with mental health conditions lack access to mental health care but have access to a mobile device. The growing access to mobile devices in South Africa has the potential to increase access to mental health care services through digital platforms. However, uptake of digital mental health interventions may be hampered by several factors, such as privacy, confidentiality, informed consent, and affordability. This study identified the prospects and challenges of implementing a mobile phone-based mental health intervention for young people in Ingwavuma area. Data were collected from 93 young people in three villages purposefully selected in Ingwavuma area. Participants included in the study were aged 16-24. Data were collected through a questionnaire. Thematic and descriptive analysis was performed on the qualitative and quantitative data, respectively. Mental health education was low, with only 22% of participants having received prior education on mental health. About 50% of the participants had come across a mental health app, but none of them had used any of these apps; 87% of participants had Internet access; 60% preferred to use social media to contact a health worker; and 92% suggested that use of digital apps would improve mental health literacy among young people. Barriers to access of digital mental health interventions were identified as the high cost of data, restrictive religious beliefs, limited privacy, lack of native languages on most digital platforms, low digital literacy, and complicated user interface. In uMkhanyakude, uptake of digital mental health apps among the young people was low. We recommend that, developers create context-specific digital applications catered for young people from different cultural backgrounds. Socio-economic issues such as affordability also need to be addressed in developing these tools.

TI  - Clinical Update: Collaborative Mental Health Care for Children and Adolescents in Pediatric Primary Care
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The objective of this Clinical Update is to review the principles, structures, processes, and outcomes of collaborative mental health care in the pediatric primary care setting.Method: A search of the literature on this topic from 2001was conducted initially in 2016, yielding 2,279 English-language citations. These citations were supplemented by references suggested by topic experts and identified through Web searches, increasing the yield to 2,467 total citations, of which 1,962 were unduplicated. After sequential review by Update authors at title/abstract and then full-text levels, the citations were winnowed to 219 based on topic relevance. A follow-up search from 2016 was conducted in 2021, yielding 2 additional citations based on nonduplication from initial search and topic relevance.Results: The collaborative care approach, arising in the 1990s and gaining momentum in the 2000s, aims to extend behavioral health care to the primary care setting. The goal of collaborative care is to conserve the sparse specialty care workforce for severe and complex psychiatric disorders through shifting certain specialty mental health tasks (eg, assessment; patient self-management; brief psychosocial intervention; basic psychopharmacology; care coordination) to primary care. Collaborative care can be delivered on a spectrum ranging from coordinated to co-located to integrated care. Although each of these models has some empirical support, integrated care-a multidisciplinary team-based approach-has the strongest evidence base in improving clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction while constraining costs. Challenges to integrated care implementation include insufficient mental health education and insufficient specialist consultative and care coordination support for primary care practitioners; space, time, and reimbursement constraints in the primary care setting; discomfort among primary care practitioners in assuming mental health tasks previously undertaken by spe-cialists; and continuing need for and unavailability of ongoing specialty mental health care for severe and complex cases. Essential supporting activities for effective collaborative care include patient and family engagement, professional education and training, evaluation/demonstration of impact, fiscal sustainability, and advocacy for model dissemination. Conclusion: Health professionals who are educated in the collaborative care approach can improve access to and quality of behavioral health care for children and adolescents with behavioral health needs.

TI  - PIONEERING AN INNOVATIVE INTERVENTION TO REDUCE MENTAL HEALTH RELATED STIGMA IN MUSLIM COMMUNITIES: A PROTOCOL
T2  - PSYCHIATRIA DANUBINA
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the prevalence of mental health related stigma in Muslim communities, there are only a limited number of intervention studies reported in the literature. Digital interventions (i.e., YouTube clips, videos) are relatively cheap, highly accessible and easily disseminated and are increasingly being used to improve mental health literacy and reduce mental health related stigma. However, as far as the authors are aware, there are no stigma reduction programmes targeting Muslim communities that leverage digital interventions reported in the literature. This paper outlines a protocol for a digital intervention to challenge mental health related stigma in Muslim communities. The proposed intervention will be a 5 to 10-minute YouTube clip/video the active ingredients of which will be: [1] an interview with a Muslim expert by lived/living experience, [2] an Imam (Muslim faith leader) and [3] a psychiatrist. We will recruit members of Muslim communities living in Muslim minority countries in the Global North (United Kingdom, Unites States of America, Canada, Australia and New Zealand) to participate in the study (inclusion criteria: adults aged 18 years and over, Muslim background). The study will be comprised of two groups: an active group that will be exposed to the Muslim faith appropriate digital intervention and a control group that will be exposed to a digital intervention that is not Muslim faith appropriate. We will administer validated psychometric stigma scales on participants in both groups before and after exposure to the interventions. We hypothesize that viewing an anti-stigma clip/video that is Islamic faith appropriate will be associated with greater reductions in mental health related stigma in members of Muslim communities compared to viewing an anti-stigma clip/video that is not Islamic faith appropriate.

TI  - 'No health without mental health': where are we now?
T2  - British journal of community nursing
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Mental health services are under unprecedented pressure with overwhelming referrals and a current waiting list of 1.2 million people of all ages. The cross-government White Paper 'No health without mental health' was launched 12 years ago detailing the importance of wellbeing services in the creation of mentally healthy communities through health promotion and illness prevention. While primary care, community services and psychiatry are pivotal in the treatment of mental Illness/disorder, mental health care per se is on a continuum, and a great deal of work can be undertaken in communities by wellbeing services to prevent avoidable referrals. This paper proposes a broad framework of education and training for wellbeing/positive mental health services, primary and community care, and nurses working in Community Mental Health Treatment Teams and Home Treatment Teams to ensure all those working with potentially vulnerable adults and children are regulated and meet national standards for mandatory mental health education and training.

TI  - The Interactive Effects of eHealth Literacy and Mental Health Literacy on Social Media Addiction and Depression-Anxiety-Stress in Adolescents: Cross-Sectional Study.
T2  - Journal of medical Internet research
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chinese adolescents are navigating a complex digital environment amidst a growing mental health crisis. While health literacy is recognized as protective, previous research has primarily examined eHealth literacy (eHL) and mental health literacy (MHL) in isolation, leaving their synergistic effects and the integrative mechanism of mental eHealth literacy (MeHL) on social media addiction (SMA) and depression-anxiety-stress (DASS) largely unexplored.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate how eHL and MHL work through MeHL to reduce SMA and DASS in adolescents. We specifically tested whether having stronger MHL makes an adolescent's eHL more effective at building their overall MeHL.METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 855 high school students (mean age 16.38, SD 0.86 years; 52.5%, 449/855 male) from 5 Chinese provinces, selected via stratified cluster random sampling. Participants completed validated scales for eHL, MHL, MeHL, SMA, and DASS. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) and Hayes' PROCESS macro (model 7) with cluster-robust SEs, controlling for age and gender. The significance of indirect and conditional effects was assessed using bias-corrected bootstrap CIs based on 5000 resamples.RESULTS: The results revealed distinct pathways. SEM path analysis indicated that both eHL (beta=-0.152, 95% CI -0.270 to -0.034; P=.01) and MHL (beta=-0.261, 95% CI -0.360 to -0.162; P<.001) were negatively associated with SMA. In contrast, only MHL demonstrated a significant negative association with DASS (beta=-0.590, 95% CI -0.647 to -0.533; P<.001), whereas the link from eHL was nonsignificant (beta=-0.011, 95% CI -0.102 to 0.080; P=.81). Bootstrapping tests confirmed that MeHL served as a significant mediator, with significant indirect paths from both eHL (SMA: beta=-0.062, 95% CI -0.125 to -0.010, P=.01; DASS: beta=-0.037, 95% CI -0.072 to -0.009, P=.008) and MHL (SMA: beta=-0.045, 95% CI -0.090 to -0.008, P=.01; DASS: beta=-0.027, 95% CI -0.053 to -0.007, P=.007). A key finding was the significant interactive association of eHL and MHL with MeHL (beta=0.067, 95% CI 0.010-0.124; P<.05). This moderated mediation was supported, as the protective indirect paths from eHL (via MeHL) to both SMA and DASS were significantly stronger at higher levels of MHL.CONCLUSIONS: Unlike previous research that examined them separately, this study shows that eHL and MHL work best when combined. We found that MHL acts like a catalyst; it enhances the value of digital skills, helping teenagers become more competent at finding, understanding, and using online MeHL support effectively. In practice, this means integrated intervention programs that teach digital skills and mental health knowledge together are likely to be much more effective in fighting SMA and reducing distress than teaching either one alone.

TI  - Influences on adolescent help-seeking for mental health problems
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGISTS AND COUNSELLORS IN SCHOOLS
M3  - Article
AB  - Seeking help for mental health concerns is critical for improving wellbeing and preventing the development of mental health disorders, yet many adolescents with mental health problems fail to seek professional help. It is well established that young people with mental health problems face a variety of barriers to help-seeking; however, little is known about the ways in which these barriers interact to impact upon the help-seeking process. Guided by the reasoned action approach, this study investigated the predictive relationship between factors that influence help-seeking. Results revealed that mental health knowledge significantly predicted help-seeking intentions, while attitudes did not. Gender differences were identified for help source preferences. The current study contributes to knowledge on the relationship between key variables that influence the adolescent help-seeking process. Findings highlight the importance of mental health knowledge in predicting help-seeking intentions and provide support for interventions that focus on improving mental health literacy in adolescents.

TI  - The development of a caregiver intervention to address child mental health in settings of complex humanitarian emergency: a multi-phase, multi-method approach
T2  - CONFLICT AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundEffective parenting can mediate the negative impact of complex humanitarian emergencies (CHEs) on child mental health, however many caregivers struggle to parent effectively in these settings. Parenting interventions have robust evidence in many settings, however research supporting their use in CHEs is limited. We describe the development of a caregiver group intervention delivered by non-specialist staff to support child mental health in CHEs.MethodsA multi-phase, multi-method approach was employed: Phase 1: semi-structured interviews, analysed inductively, with specialist mental health staff in CHEs on needs and challenges in providing mental healthcare to children and caregivers. Phase 2: initial intervention development informed by Phase 1 and evidence-based theoretical approaches and psychological therapies. Phase 3: expert review of draft intervention. Phase 4: semi-structured interviews, analysed inductively, with non-specialist staff in Papua New Guinea (PNG) to evaluate relevance, comprehensibility, and applicability of the intervention. Phase 5: cultural adaptation of the intervention prior to implementation in Northern Iraq. Different operational partners and research sites were employed at different phases of development to increase diversity of inputs and support the overall vision of an intervention that addressed common mental health difficulties and underlying factors to support children and caregivers across CHEs.ResultsMental health staff in CHEs identified a significant need for interventions to support parenting and address child mental health needs. A caregiver group intervention was developed consisting of six two-hour sessions, delivered weekly by non-specialist staff, and targeting parent knowledge and skills and parent stress. Expert consultation identified aspects of the intervention to emphasise or simplify, resulting in a refined intervention with ensured clinical quality. Non-specialist staff in PNG confirmed the intervention relevance to a vulnerable population in a humanitarian setting, and the manual was determined suitable for non-specialist facilitators. Mental health literacy, stigma and cultural views (masculinity, family privacy) were identified as challenges to address. A multi-stage method of cultural adaptation in Iraq ensured the clinical and cultural accuracy, relevance, and acceptability of the intervention. Initial adaptations to the language and metaphors used in the intervention resulted in high cultural appropriateness during pilot testing. Prioritising the recruitment and engagement of male caregivers is critical.ConclusionsA caregiver intervention to support child mental health in CHEs is available. It's development using multi-method, co-design processes will ensure its relevance and acceptability to target populations. Further research to evaluate the effectiveness and long-term effectiveness of the intervention is warranted.

TI  - Mental health stigma in adolescents: a scoping review
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY SOCIETY & EDUCATION
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction. Mental health disorders are increasingly common in adolescence, and peer stigma represents a significant barrier. Defining this construct is essential for its evaluation, prevention, and intervention. The aim of this study was to conceptualize mental disorder stigma in adolescents. Method. A scoping review was conducted in the Web of Science, Scopus, Eric, PubMed, and PsycInfo databases (2011-2021), using descriptors in both English and Spanish. A total of 11,144 articles were retrieved; 51 were selected after screening, and six additional articles were included through other methods. Results. Social stigma in adolescents is described as negative beliefs that may lead to rejection and discriminatory behavior. Different types were identified (public stigma, selfstigma, structural stigma, and associative stigma). Stigma is considered a multidimensional construct (cognitive, emotional, and behavioral dimensions) and is influenced by variables such as sex, nationality, educational level, age, socioeconomic status, personal experience, mental health literacy, and help-seeking behavior. Discussion. Most studies are grounded in the theoretical contributions of Goffman and Corrigan. Recent literature highlights the urgent need to develop effective, sustainable, and culturally adapted prevention programs. The lack of consensus on conceptual and methodological frameworks hinders comparison across studies, reinforcing the importance of valid instruments tailored to adolescents. Identifying factors that influence stigma is essential to guide more inclusive educational interventions.

TI  - Self-Reported Stressors in Early Adolescence: The Role of Educational Track and Ethnic Background
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARLY ADOLESCENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aimed to identify overall stress and salient stressors experienced by adolescents from different education tracks and self-perceived ethnic backgrounds. A total of 1489 adolescents (M = 13.40 years; SD = 0.89 years) from nine Dutch secondary schools participated. Self-reported stressors were measured with the adapted version of the Adolescent Stress Questionnaire - Short. After controlling for age, gender, country of birth, and school classes, results showed that overall stress did not differ for educational track nor for ethnic background subgroups. Adolescents in academic education reported more stress from school-related stressors than adolescents attending vocational education. Adolescents with a mixed ethnic background (i.e., Dutch and another ethnicity) reported more stress regarding school-related stressors than adolescents with a Dutch ethnic background. These differences between adolescents of different educational tracks and ethnic backgrounds have implications for intervention programs targeting specific stressors.

TI  - Suicide and Suicidal Ideation in Medical Students: A Systematic Review
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - The incidence of suicide and its ideation among medical students is increasingly recognized as a significant issue, influenced by the demanding nature of medical education and the various associated psychological stressors. This systematic review aims to elucidate the risk factors and prevalence of suicide and suicidal ideation within this group, with a focus on the implications for mental health interventions. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, this review analyzed 11 studies selected from major databases such as Scopus-Elsevier, Google Scholar, PubMed, and others, focusing on publications between 2015 and 2023. Studies were predominantly observational and cross-sectional, examining suicide rates and suicidal ideation among medical students. The review found that medical students experience higher rates of suicide and suicidal ideation compared to the general population, with significant stressors including academic pressure, personal relationship challenges, and professional expectations. Notably, female respondents displayed a higher prevalence of suicidal ideation than males. Key warning signs identified include changes in mood or behavior and previous attempts of suicide. Despite varying findings regarding the role of medical training duration on suicidal ideation, all studies highlight the critical need for targeted mental health support. The findings underscore the urgent need for integrated mental health services and the incorporation of mental health education within the medical curriculum. A multidimensional approach involving enhancements to both curricular and support structures is crucial for mitigating the risk of suicide among medical students. Future research should focus on developing and evaluating interventions to reduce educational stress and promote psychological wellbeing in medical educational settings.

TI  - Exploring the Needs of Stakeholders For Successful Patient Involvement in Mental Health Education
T2  - PUBLIC HEALTH REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective This scoping review aims to comprehensively map the existing literature on Patient Involvement (PI) in mental health education (MHE), identify the needs of mental health (MH) educators, students, and patients with lived experiences of MH challenges and develop a checklist for successful implementation of PI in MHE.Methods Conducted between November 2023-January 2024, this review followed PRISMA-ScR guidelines in databases PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, and WHO. Eligibility criteria adhered to PICOS guidelines, and screening was done via Covidence. Content analysis was carried out to develop a checklist.Results Eleven qualitative articles were found, revealing two superordinate stakeholder needs categories: Interpersonal and Course Needs. Interpersonal Needs included Self-determination, Communication and Collaboration, Recognition and Support, and Holistic approach. Course Needs comprised Content, Organisational, and Teaching. A checklist was developed to support PI in MHE.Conclusion Guidelines for successful PI in MHE should prioritize patient autonomy, foster collaboration, provide support, ensure inclusive course content, and promote patient involvement in educational processes. Study limitations, such as potential bias, underscore the need for future research to enhance evidence-based practices in MHE.

TI  - Bridging the Gap: A Pilot Study of a Lay Health Worker Model to Decrease Child Mental Health Stigma and Promote Parents' Professional Help-Seeking for Black/African American Children
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES
M3  - Article
AB  - Unmet mental health needs among children in the United States (U.S.) are at a critical status (Kimball & Miller, 2015; Perou et at., 2013), with less than half of children receiving needed care (Whitney & Peterson, 2019). Unmet mental health needs are especially pronounced for racial/ethnic minority children, including Black/African American children (Alegria et al.. 2010; Cokley et al., 2014), whose rates of suicide among those aged 5-11 years has increased in the past two decades (Bridge et al., 2015). Culturally responsive strategies that build on common mental health help-seeking pathways for Black/African American families are needed to improve access to care. The Bridging the Gap pilot project described in this paper used an innovative lay health worker model embedded in faith-based networks to target child mental health stigma and promote professional help-seeking among 65 Black/African American parents of children 5-12 years old. A single-group, pretest, posttest, follow-up (PPF) design (with double pretest and double follow-up) was used to structure the delivery of the pilot program and data collection. Child mental health stigma significantly decreased after the intervention portion of the program but help-seeking attitudes stayed constant. Thirteen parents had children with clinically significant mental health needs. Of the eight parents reached for follow-up, five sought child mental health services based on individualized recommendations and the rest endorsed intentions to follow through on service recommendations. Parents endorsed satisfaction with the program and several program evaluation themes were identified through qualitative data. Recommendations and future directions are discussed.

TI  - 'A mouthpiece to make a positive impact': Australian journalists' attitudes, knowledge, and experiences reporting on mental ill-health and suicide in sportspeople
T2  - MEDIA INTERNATIONAL AUSTRALIA
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The media is a significant source of information about mental health and can considerably influence public attitudes. Elite sportspeople are role models for young people and prominent figures in Australian culture. However, little is known about journalists' attitudes, experiences, and training needs for reporting on mental ill-health and suicide in high-profile athletes and coaches. An invitation email for a cross-sectional online survey was sent directly to journalists. The survey included demographic characteristics, and measures assessing their knowledge and attitudes towards mental health and suicide, and views, experiences and training needs for reporting on mental ill-health and suicide in sportspeople. Inductive qualitative content analysis of the written responses was conducted, and mean scores and percentages were calculated for the quantitative measures. A total of 81 Australian journalists (43 identified as women; 38 identified as men) aged 22-76 years (M = 22.0, SD = 13.8) participated in the study. Participants had diverse opinions on the media's responsibility when reporting mental health and suicide in elite sportspeople, with some believing they had an important role in reducing stigma. Notably, almost half of the participants had never received training on how to report on mental ill-health and suicide. Given that there are no current guidelines for reporting on these issues for sportspeople, further training resources are likely to be beneficial. However, training format, content and delivery may need to be shaped around journalists' preferences and information needs, including delivery by experts such as those with lived experience, researchers, and practitioners.

TI  - Adolescent mental health in sub-Saharan Africa: crisis? What crisis? Solution? What solution?
T2  - GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Addressing adolescent mental health care across sub-Saharan Africa faces numerous challenges, including underfunded public health systems, a shortage of mental health professionals, barriers to access, and pervasive stigma. Untreated adolescents often experience worsening symptoms, academic and social difficulties, physical health risks, and engage in risky behaviours. Early detection and appropriate treatment of common mental health conditions can support adolescents in developing robust social and emotional foundations and enhancing their mental well-being. Ensuring adolescents receive the mental health care required for healthy development depends on collaborative, evidence-based solutions that consider the contextual challenges of sub-Saharan Africa. Innovative community-based solutions to mental health services may significantly improve accessibility and support adolescents close to their homes and schools. For example, co-creation and peer-delivered interventions with professional supervision may enhance uptake and reduce stigma. This short article adds to the current debate arguing for working with communities and implementing community mental health services for common mental health conditions. Sensitivity to community-specific challenges and building referral networks are crucial for effective care. Investing in these strategies, alongside increasing mental health literacy, could lead to affordable and significant interventions to address adolescent mental health.

TI  - The Impact of a Messenger-Based Psychosocial Chat Counseling Service on Further Help-Seeking Among Children and Young Adults: Longitudinal Study
T2  - JMIR MENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Mental crises have high prevalences in adolescence. Early interventions appear to be highly important to diminish the risk of the deterioration, recurrence, or chronification of symptoms. In recent years, various providers have started offering live chat support in psychological crises. The messenger-based psychological counseling service krisenchat aims to support young people in crises and, if necessary, provide a recommendation for a referral to the health care system or to seek further help from a trusted adult person.Objective: This study aimed to investigate the impact of using the counseling service of krisenchat on the further help-seeking behavior of young people, and to identify associated factors of further help-seeking.Methods: This longitudinal study analyzed anonymous data from 247 individuals who used krisenchat between October 2021 and March 2022, and received a recommendation for further help-seeking. An online survey directly after the chat assessed the perceived helpfulness of the chat and well-being after the chat. After 4 weeks, further help-seeking, facilitators and barriers to help-seeking, and self-efficacy were assessed in an online follow-up survey.Results: The most frequently recommended services or persons to seek further help from included a psychotherapist or social psychiatric service (75/225, 33.3%), a school psychologist or school social worker (52/225, 23.1%), and the user's parents (45/225, 20.0%). Of the 247 users, 120 (48.6%) indicated that they contacted the recommended service or person, and of these, 87 (72.5%) stated that they already had an appointment (or talk) with the respective service or person or that an appointment (or talk) was scheduled. The most frequently reported facilitators for further help-seeking were mental health literacy (54/120, 45.0%), improvement of self-efficacy (55/120, 45.8%), and symptom recognition (40/120, 33.3%). In users not displaying further help-seeking behavior, the most frequent barriers included stigmatization (60/127, 47.2%), lack of mental health literacy (59/127, 46.5%), need for self-reliance and autonomy (53/127, 41.7%), and negative family beliefs regarding help services (53/127, 41.7%). Subgroup comparisons indicated significantly higher levels of self-efficacy in users displaying further help-seeking behavior than in those not displaying further help-seeking behavior. Both subgroups did not differ in gender, age, recommended service or person, chat topics, perceived helpfulness, and well-being.Conclusions: The findings of this study indicate that children and young adults receiving counseling on krisenchat benefit in terms of seeking further help. Further help-seeking seems to be associated with higher levels of self-efficacy.Trial Registration: Deutsches Register Klinischer Studien DRKS00026671; https://tinyurl.com/4fm5xe68(JMIR Ment Health 2023;10:e43780) doi: 10.2196/43780

TI  - The Use of Nautical Activities in Formal Education: A Systematic Review
T2  - BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: The implementation of nautical sports, particularly in coastal areas, during the school stage is a growing phenomenon. It offers unique opportunities for students to develop the necessary competencies outlined in their physical education curriculum in an immersive manner, within a natural and inherently motivating environment. Material and methods: This study aims to delve deeper into this subject by conducting a systematic review of the utilization of water sports in formal education. To carry out this bibliographic search, the following keywords were employed: "Nautical Activities", "Nautical Sports", "Nautical Camps", "Formal Education", "Children Education", "Primary School", and "Secondary School". The Boolean operator "and" was used to combine these keywords during the search conducted in databases such as Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and SPORTDiscus. The PRISMA Protocol was utilized for the search process, resulting in the selection and categorization of eight papers into the following thematic areas: Wellbeing, Physical and Mental Health, Education, and Management. Results: The primary findings of this review indicate that the inclusion of these programs within physical education classes enhances overall physical health, mental well-being, and personal development. Conclusions: The results demonstrate a positive impact on peer interaction and short-term improvement in self-confidence.

TI  - Associations between teacher-student relationship and externalizing problem behaviors among Chinese rural adolescent
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The primary objective of this study is to present a fresh perspective on the correlation between teacher-student relationships and externalizing problem behaviors among adolescents. While previous research has examined this connection, there is still an insufficient understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Moreover, the crucial role of peer relationships, mental health, and parental knowledge has been overlooked. In this study, a total of 6,919 Chinese rural adolescents aged 13-19 years participated by completing an anonymous self-report questionnaire. The results show that: (1) teacher-student relationship has a protective effect against the development of externalizing problem behaviors; (2) peer relationship and mental health both have a mediating role in the relationship between teacher-student relationship and externalizing problem behaviors; (3) teacher-student relationship can indirectly affect externalizing problem behaviors through the chain mediation of peer relationship and mental health; (4) parental knowledge plays a moderating role between the teacher-student relationship and externalizing problem behaviors. As the level of parental knowledge increases among rural adolescents, the impact of the teacher-student relationship on externalizing problem behaviors becomes more pronounced; and (5) the impact of teacher-student relationship on externalizing problem behaviors has no significant gender differences. Given the study's empirical outcomes, we discuss potential explanations and advocate for a comprehensive pedagogical approach to mitigate rural adolescent externalizing behaviors. This entails nurturing teacher-student relations, fostering inclusive peer environments, emphasizing mental health literacy, and synergizing with caregivers for a holistic home-school intervention.

TI  - Evaluation of an online suicide prevention program to improve suicide literacy and to reduce suicide stigma: A mixed methods study
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Low-threshold e-health approaches in prevention to reduce suicide stigma are scarce. We developed an online program containing video reports on lived experience of suicide and evidence-based information on suicidality. We evaluated the program by a mixed methods design. We examined pre-post-changes of program completers (n = 268) in suicide literacy, suicide stigma (self and perceived), and self-efficacy expectation of being able to seek support in psychologically difficult situations using linear mixed models. To examine reported changes and helpful program elements 12-26 weeks after program completion, we content analyzed transcripts of telephone interviews (n = 16). Program completers showed more suicide literacy (Cohen's d = .74; p < .001), higher self-efficacy expectations to seek support (d = .09; p < .01), lower self-stigma (subscales glorification/normalization: d = -.13, p = .04; isolation/depression: d = -.14; p = .04; stigma: d = -.10; p = .07; n = 168) compared to baseline. We found no significant differences in perceived suicide stigma. We identified lived experience reports, the possibility of sharing own narrative on stigma and suicidality, and information on support as helpful elements. The current online program can increase suicide literacy and self-efficacy expectations to seek support and reduce self-stigma. We recommend a larger randomized controlled trial with longer follow-up to confirm these findings.

AB  - This study examined the impact of cross-level simulated learning experiences (SLEs) on graduate Clinical Mental Health Counseling and undergraduate psychology students. The cases used in the SLE were with identified clients and family members. Using a pre-post design, researchers measured changes in self-efficacy, perceptions of simulation, and interprofessional attitudes. Results showed significant improvements in self-efficacy, including problem-solving and emotional regulation. Students reported increased perceptions of simulation realism and value. Small to medium effect sizes indicated meaningful improvements, suggesting SLEs can effectively bridge theoretical knowledge and practical application in mental health education.

TI  - Category characteristics of high school students' sense of hope and its relationship with mental health
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeThis study used the latent profile analysis technique to investigate the latent categories of high school students' sense of hope and their relationship with mental health. MethodsA total of 1,513 high school students from six middle schools in China was tested using the Adult Dispositional Hope Scale and the Symptom Checklist 90. Analysis of variance was used to explore the relationship between latent categories of sense of hope and mental health. ResultsHigh school students' sense of hope scores are negatively associated with mental health scores. The high school students' sense of hope could be divided into three latent categories: negative sense of hope group, moderate sense of hope group and positive sense of hope group. The differences in scores on each dimension of mental health among high school students with different latent categories of sense of hope were statistically significant. The positive sense of hope group had lower scores on the dimensions of somatization, compulsive symptoms, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, terror, paranoia, and psychosis than the negative sense of hope group and the moderate sense of hope group. ConclusionThere are three latent categories of high school students' sense of hope, and the sense of hope category is closely related to mental health. Based on the different categories of high school students' sense of hope, the program of mental health education can be reasonably selected to create a positive general environment for mental health education and ultimately enhance the mental health of high school students.

TI  - Supported Education in a Swedish Context - Opportunities and Challenges for Developing Career-Oriented Support for Young Adults with Mental Health Problems
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF DISABILITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Young adults experiencing mental health problems often need both individual support and educational accommodations to successfully complete their studies. Recent research also points to the need for career-related, educational services in a labor market that increasingly demands formal education or training.The aim of this study was to investigate the development of supported education services in Sweden, in relation to pursuing educational and vocational goals. Interviews were conducted with a broad sample of stakeholders who are currently developing supported education services, as well as young adults utilizing educational support.The results suggest a number of key factors for accommodating the needs of these students which include, in addition to basic academic, mental health and individual supports, attention to economic challenges, social contexts and improved mental health literacy for educational actors. The results additionally substantiate the relevance of educational supports to long-term vocational goals when providing employment support services.

TI  - Effectiveness of Neurofeedback-Assisted and Conventional 6-Week Web-Based Mindfulness Interventions on Mental Health of Chinese Nursing Students: Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Nursing students experience disproportionately high rates of mental health challenges, underscoring the urgent need for innovative, scalable interventions. Web-based mindfulness programs, and more recently, neurofeedback-enhanced approaches, present potentially promising avenues for addressing this critical issue. Objective: This study aimed to explore the effectiveness of the neurofeedback-assisted online mindfulness intervention (NAOM) and the conventional online mindfulness intervention (COM) in reducing mental health symptoms among Chinese nursing students. Methods: A 3-armed randomized controlled trial was conducted among 147 nursing students in Beijing, China, using a 6-week web-based mindfulness program. Participants received NAOM, COM, or general mental health education across 6 weeks. Electroencephalogram and validated tools such as the Patient Health Questionnaire and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire were used to primarily assess symptoms of depression and anxiety at baseline, immediately after the intervention, and at 1 and 3 months after the intervention. Generalized estimating equations were used to evaluate the effects of intervention and time. Results: A total of 155 participants enrolled in the study, and 147 finished all assessments. Significant reductions in the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and fatigue were observed in the NAOM (mean difference [MD]=-3.330, Cohen d=0.926, P<.001; MD=-3.468, Cohen d=1.091, P<.001; MD=-2.620, Cohen d=0.743, P<.001, respectively) and the COM (MD=-1.875, Cohen d=0.490, P=.03; MD=-1.750, Cohen d=0.486, P=.02; MD=-2.229, Cohen d=0.629, P=.01, respectively) groups compared with the control group at postintervention assessment. Moreover, the NAOM group showed significantly better effects than the COM group in alleviating depressive symptoms (MD=-1.455; Cohen d=0.492; P=.04) and anxiety symptoms (MD=-1.718; Cohen d=0.670; P=.04) and improving the level of mindfulness (MD=-3.765; Cohen d=1.245; P<.001) at the postintervention assessment. However, no significant difference except for the anxiety symptoms was observed across the 3 groups at the 1-and 3-month follow-ups. Conclusions: This 6-week web-based mindfulness intervention, both conventional and neurofeedback-assisted, effectively alleviated mental health problems in the short term among nursing students. The addition of neurofeedback demonstrated greater short-term benefits; however, but these effects were not sustained over the long term. Future research should focus on long-term interventions using a more robust methodological approach.

TI  - The influence of sports regulation in English teaching on students' psychological state
T2  - REVISTA DE PSICOLOGIA DEL DEPORTE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to investigate the effect of sports regulation on the psychological state of English students. The author administered the experimental method and SCL-90 symptom assessment to 461 students in a regional normal school. By gathering data from students at various stages of the experiment, psychological trends and emotional shifts were identified promptly to improve experimental outcomes. The questionnaire data and test results were processed and analyzed using SPSS and other statistical software. The study results indicate that the sports intervention is viable and effective in boosting pupils' mental health. To effectively protect students' physical and mental health development, colleges and universities should strengthen the publicity and construction work in this area, let students realize the true significance of sports, and encourage students to engage in sports and form healthy sports habits actively. In addition, it provides techniques and recommendations for enhancing mental health education to enhance the mental health of students at this school effectively.

TI  - Harmonizing early intervention strategies: scoping review of clinical high risk for psychosis and borderline personality disorder
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Aims: To map studies assessing both clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR-P) and borderline personality disorder (BPD) in clinical samples, focusing on clinical/research/preventive paradigms and proposing informed research recommendations. Methods: We conducted a PRISMA-ScR/JBI-compliant scoping review (protocol: https://osf.io/8mz7a) of primary research studies (cross-sectional/longitudinal designs) using valid measures/criteria to assess CHR-P and BPD (threshold/subthreshold) in clinical samples, reporting on CHR-P/psychotic symptoms and personality disorder(s) in the title/abstract/keywords, identified in Web of Science/PubMed/(EBSCO)PsycINFO until 23/08/2023. Results: 33 studies were included and categorized into four themes reflecting their respective clinical/research/preventive paradigm: (i) BPD as a comorbidity in CHR-P youth (k = 20), emphasizing early detection and intervention in psychosis; (ii) attenuated psychosis syndrome (APS) as a comorbidity among BPD inpatients (k = 2), with a focus on hospitalized adolescents/young adults admitted for non-psychotic mental disorders; (iii) mixed samples (k = 7), including descriptions of early intervention services and referral pathways; (iv) transdiagnostic approaches (k = 4) highlighting "clinical high at risk mental state" (CHARMS) criteria to identify a pluripotent risk state for severe mental disorders. Conclusion: The scoping review reveals diverse approaches to clinical care for CHR-P and BPD, with no unified treatment strategies. Recommendations for future research should focus on: (i) exploring referral pathways across early intervention clinics to promote timely intervention; (ii) enhancing early detection strategies in innovative settings such as emergency departments; (iii) improving mental health literacy to facilitate help-seeking behaviors; (iv) analysing comorbid disorders as complex systems to better understand and target early psychopathology; (v) investigating prospective risk for BPD; (vi) developing transdiagnostic interventions; (vii) engaging youth with lived experience of comorbidity to gain insight on their subjective experience; (viii) understanding caregiver burden to craft family-focused interventions; (ix) expanding research in underrepresented regions such as Africa and Asia, and; (x) evaluating the cost-effectiveness of early interventions to determine scalability across different countries.

TI  - Is Digital Treatment the Holy Grail? Literature Review on Computerized and Blended Treatment for Depressive Disorders in Youth
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Computerized and blended treatments seem to be an attractive treatment for adolescents as an alternative to face-to-face treatment, but mental health professionals seem hesitant to use these treatment modalities. This review provides an overview of factors contributing to and withholding from using computerized or blended treatment in routine care. Three databases were searched with terms related to (1) adolescents, (2) depression, (3) computerized or blended, and (4) treatment. Of the 33 articles identified, 10 focused on unguided computerized treatments, six on guided, two on blended, two compared unguided, blended- and face-to-face treatment to no treatment, and eight studies on games. Further, two articles that were focused on an online monitoring tool and three on intervention characteristics or preferred modes of help-seeking. Evidence for effectiveness, adherence, drop-out, and forming therapeutic relations were suspected to be barriers, but are no reason to reject computerized or blended treatment. Improvement in mental health literacy and the possibility to tailor the intervention are facilitators. However, adolescents' intention to seek help, acceptability of computerized treatment, symptom severity, time spent by therapist, and other facilities are identified as barriers and they need to be taken into account when using computerized or blended interventions. Nevertheless, computerized and blended are promising treatments for depressed youth.

TI  - Dos and Don'ts in Designing School-Based Awareness Programs for Suicide Prevention: Results of a Three-Stage Delphi Survey
T2  - CRISIS-THE JOURNAL OF CRISIS INTERVENTION AND SUICIDE PREVENTION
M3  - Article
AB  - .Background: Despite the promising evidence for the effectiveness of school-based awareness programs in decreasing the rates of suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts in young people, no guidelines on the targets and methods of safe and effective awareness programs exist. Aims: This study intends to distill recommendations for school-based suicide awareness and prevention programs from experts. Method: A three-stage Delphi survey was administered to an expert panel between November 2018 and March 2019. A total of 214 items obtained from open-ended questions and the literature were rated in two rounds. Consensus and stability were used as assessment criteria. Results: The panel consisted of 19 participants in the first and 13 in the third stage. Recommended targets included the reduction of suicide attempts, the enhancement of help-seeking and peer support, as well as the promotion of mental health literacy and life skills. Program evaluation, facilitating access to healthcare, and long-term action plans across multiple levels were among the best strategies for the prevention of adverse effects. Limitations: The study is based on opinions of a rather small number of experts. Conclusion: The promotion of help-seeking and peer support as well as facilitating access to mental health-care utilities appear pivotal for the success of school-based awareness programs.

TI  - Shortening duration of untreated illness in young people with first episode eating disorders: protocol of a randomised controlled feasibility trial of a smartphone friendly multi-modal decision-making tool (FREED-M) to improve help-seeking
T2  - PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundEarly intervention gives young people the best chance to recover from eating disorders (EDs). An important focus of early intervention is shortening the time between a person first developing symptoms and starting treatment (duration of untreated eating disorder; DUED). Patient-related factors (e.g. poor mental health literacy and help-seeking difficulties) are strongly associated with DUED. The aims of our study are to co-design and test the feasibility of FREED-Mobile (FREED-M), an online intervention tool for young people with early-stage EDs. This tool aims to improve knowledge about EDs, increase motivation to seek treatment and teach early steps towards change or recovery, thus reducing DUED.MethodsWe will carry out a randomised controlled feasibility trial comparing the FREED-M tool with a control intervention where individuals are sign-posted to an ED charity website. The objectives of the proposed trial are to establish/estimate: (a) attrition rates at follow-up (primary feasibility outcome); (b) participant recruitment; (c) intervention uptake, completion rates and acceptability; (d) intervention effect sizes and standard deviations for outcomes to inform the sample size calculation for a large-scale randomised controlled trial (RCT); (e) stakeholder views on the intervention.We aim to recruit 116 participants (young people, aged 16-25, with first episode ED) from primary care, schools and universities, ED services and social media. Online assessments will be carried out at baseline, end of intervention and follow-up (weeks 0, 4 and 12 post-randomisation, respectively). Outcomes will include motivation and readiness to change, attitudes and intentions towards help-seeking, ED symptoms, mood and social functioning, and health-related quality of life. Additionally, we will carry out a qualitative evaluation of participants' views of the intervention and study design.MethodsWe will carry out a randomised controlled feasibility trial comparing the FREED-M tool with a control intervention where individuals are sign-posted to an ED charity website.

If effective, this novel, online intervention has the potential for wide dissemination and for substantially reducing DUED to improve long-term patient outcomes.Trial registrationISRCTN, ISRCTN15662055.Registered 27 July 2022, https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN15662055.

TI  - Suicide in China: Community Attitudes and Stigma
T2  - OMEGA-JOURNAL OF DEATH AND DYING
M3  - Article
AB  - China accounts for an estimated third of the world's suicides, yet individuals experiencing suicidality typically do not seek out or receive treatment. This study examines community perceptions and public stigma toward suicide. In Shanghai, China 186 adults were recruited to participate in a survey with an experimental vignette describing a suicidal individual, manipulated on gender and age, followed by questions eliciting attitudes toward suicide. Most participants agreed that the suicidal subject had a serious problem, with seriousness of the problem decreasing with participant's age. Participants reported moderate levels of public stigma. More stigma was found toward adolescent subjects rather than adult. Male subjects were perceived as being more likely to change than females. The public's accurate view of suicide without biases could help prevent suicide from getting worse. Public perceptions regarding a suicidal individual's likelihood to change could lead to stigma reduction, which can subsequently help with effective crisis intervention.

TI  - Pediatric cardiac surgery preparation: Enhancing psychological resilience and coping skills in congenital heart defect patients and families
T2  - PROGRESS IN PEDIATRIC CARDIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Preparation support-defined as structured, age-appropriate educational and psychological interventions to familiarize patients with upcoming procedures-is important for emotionally vulnerable children undergoing heart surgery. Objectives: This pilot study evaluated a preparation program for pediatric cardiac surgery patients and identified effective components for psychological support. Methods: Six patients (aged 5-16 years) undergoing cardiac surgery and their parents participated in our preparation program, which included role-play with medical equipment, age-appropriate videos demonstrating perioperative flow and sensory information, and coping strategy instruction. Data were collected through perioperative observations, post-discharge interviews with children, and parental questionnaires, then analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Results: Preparatory counseling improved illness acceptance, treatment motivation, and self-coping skills during the perioperative period. Children demonstrated positive emotional and cooperative responses during hospitalization, with qualitative analysis revealing two main categories of children's experiences: 1) understanding of treatment and sense of accomplishment, and 2) fluctuating anxiety and stress. Parental responses similarly formed two categories: concerns about communication and expectations for healthcare collaboration. Some children initially experienced increased fear that typically resolved over time. Conclusion: Preparation counseling effectively supports pediatric cardiac surgery patients psychologically while helping parents provide appropriate emotional support. The mixed emotional responses observed highlight the need for ongoing program refinement. Enhanced preparation programs specifically designed for children with congenital heart disease can reduce psychological distress during extended hospitalizations and improve overall well-being in this vulnerable population.

TI  - Impact on staff of the Mentally Healthy Schools Framework
T2  - HEALTH EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The Mentally Healthy Schools Framework (MHSF), based on the population-wide Act-Belong-Commit mental health promotion campaign, is a whole-school approach primarily targeting student mental health, but it is also intended for staff. This paper presents the results of an impact survey on staff after the implementation of the Framework in a number of schools in Western Australia. Design/methodology/approach A baseline questionnaire was completed by n = 87 staff at schools that had just signed up to the programme, and a participant questionnaire was completed by n = 146 staff at schools that had been participating for at least 17 months. Findings The results show that the Framework has had a substantial impact on many staff in terms of increased mental health literacy and taking action to improve their mental health. Originality/value Mental health interventions in schools generally focus on students' well-being and how to deal with student mental health problems. There are few comprehensive interventions that also include staff well-being.

TI  - Learning About Mental Health Lived Experience in Social Work Education
T2  - AUSTRALIAN SOCIAL WORK
M3  - Article
AB  - Lived experience education occupies an increasingly important space in mental health education for social workers. Despite being plagued by practices that continue to be discriminating and exclusionary, the mental health policy and practice context demand robust attention to the meaningful inclusion of service users and their families to achieve genuine partnership, reciprocity, and equality in mental health service provision. For social work educators, lived experience education is now an indispensable component of a critically informed mental health curriculum and pedagogy. Framed within an appeal for epistemic justice, this article reports on qualitative survey data from social work students who experienced teaching from people with lived experience. Findings show that students greatly valued lived experience education, as it created opportunities for authentic and more diverse understandings of mental health that fostered critical reflection. A curriculum that supports epistemic equality and a social justice agenda would help scaffold lived experience expertise for student learning.IMPLICATIONS Mental health lived experience education positively impacts social work students' values and attitudes towards mental health service users.Lived experience education supports social work students to expand their understandings of mental health and recovery beyond dominant biomedical perspectives.Genuine valuing of lived experience knowledge and expertise in social work education helps address epistemic injustice.

AB  - The mobile Internet gender psychological education curriculum for primary school students takes positive development as the core idea, which has high value for improving the quality of primary school students' mental health education. The teaching evaluation of this course can improve the efficiency and effect of teaching, and provide reference and help for future teaching. However, the current effect evaluation methods have the problem of single evaluation. Therefore, this paper studies the evaluation method of mobile online course effect of gender psychological education for primary school students. This paper analyzes the content of gender psychology education for primary school students, and establishes a teaching model of gender psychology education on mobile networks by using the interactive relationship between learners and learning resources. Establish an evaluation index system according to the course content and teaching interaction mode. Based on the theory of fuzzy mathematics, the evaluation model of the effect of gender psychology education curriculum for primary school students is established. The corresponding weight values are obtained by using the fuzzy consistent judgment matrix, and the numerical results of comprehensive evaluation are obtained. The experimental results show that the designed course effect evaluation method can improve the accuracy of evaluation and the evaluation results are more convincing.

TI  - Adolescents as Co-Designers: How Youth Perspectives Can Shape the Foundation for Mental Health Interventions in Northern Ghana.
T2  - Research square
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Preprint
AB  - Background: Adolescents in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) face significant mental health challenges, yet their voices are often underrepresented in intervention design. Co-design approaches, such as human-centered design, offer a promising approach to tailor interventions to specific needs and context; however, this requires careful adaption in LMICs where resources, design experience, and cultural factors impact engagement and efficacy. This study documents how human-centered design was adapted to engage adolescents in co-designing a school-based mental health intervention, highlighting the contextualization of co-design methods to the Ghanaian sociocultural context and the unique participation of youth.Methods: Guided by the first two phases of human-centered design, we conducted two workshops with 24 students from 12 public senior high schools in Tamale, Ghana. Workshop 1 (Inspiration) explored adolescent perspectives on mental health using structured case-based discussions guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Workshop 2 (Ideation) focused on identifying preferred mental health prevention strategies using interactive, choice-based activities. To accommodate cognitive and sociocultural factors, workshops incorporated structured facilitation, visual analogies, peer-driven engagement, and scaffolded decision-making. Qualitative data from discussions, facilitator notes, and artifacts were analyzed thematically.Results: Workshop 1 (Inspiration) identified key adolescent mental health concerns, including stigma, confidentiality fears, and peer and family influences. Gender-segregated discussions provided insights into culturally-specific challenges, such as substance use norms among boys and gendered expectations limiting girls' access to support. Workshop 2 (Ideation) led to the prioritization of five school-based prevention strategies: teacher training, mental health curricular integration, mentorship programs, teaching positive thinking and mindfulness, and using entertainment-based methods for mental health education. Adolescents shifted from viewing mental health challenges as individual struggles to recognizing the role of schools and communities in prevention. An adolescent advisory board was formed to sustain youth engagement in intervention refinement.Conclusions: Contextualized co-design methods can meaningfully engage adolescents in LMICs, leading to culturally grounded and actionable mental health interventions. Structured facilitation enhances the feasibility and authenticity of youth-driven co-design, contributing methodological insights for implementation science in resource-limited settings. This study provides a replicable framework to apply to diverse LMIC contexts and health topics and elevates youth voices in shaping effective, sustainable interventions.

TI  - Adaptation, Innovation and Co-Production: Meeting the Mental Wellbeing Needs of a Digital Generation
T2  - YOUTH
M3  - Article
AB  - In the aftermath of a global health pandemic, youth mental health is a public-health emergency. The acceleration of digital technologies, catalysed by COVID-19, has seen the growing significance of online support and social media for promoting health behaviours. This exploratory study utilised a participatory-action research (PAR) design to investigate adolescents' (N = 10; aged 16-18) perceptions and experiences of social media with respect to mental-wellbeing content. Data were collected using a focus-group method. Young people (YP) also evaluated digital resources adapted from the Super Skills for Life (SSL-A) intervention. Thematic analysis elicited three thematic categories: young people's relationship with social media, perceptions and experiences of support pathways, and cultivating mental-health and wellbeing provision for a digital generation. Findings revealed that YP were discerning digital citizens and willing to use technologies for support. Although exposure to social-media images and videos can convey social norms and shape normative perceptions of healthy wellbeing, mental-health literacy was a critical factor prompting change. Future co-production research is needed to design, develop, and evaluate digital resources adapted from evidence-based programmes to contribute to hybrid models of mental-wellbeing provision that can offer YP timely and appropriate support and a choice of delivery modalities.

TI  - Effects of mindfulness, music therapy, and social support on adolescents test anxiety
T2  - BMC PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Test anxiety is a common form of situational anxiety among adolescents, which can seriously affect their academic performance and mental health. Guided by Emotion Regulation Theory and Social Support Theory, this study explores the mechanism by which mindfulness influences adolescent test anxiety, introducing music therapy and social support as chained mediators. Method A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted among 372 adolescents from a secondary school in China. Measurement tools included the Mindfulness Scale, Music Therapy Perception Scale, Social Support Scale, and Test Anxiety Scale. Correlation analysis was performed using SPSS 26.0, and chained mediation analysis was conducted using the PROCESS macro (Model 6). Results The results showed that mindfulness had a significant negative effect on adolescent test anxiety (beta = -0.349, p < 0.001). Music therapy mediated the relationship between mindfulness and test anxiety, with an indirect effect of -0.074 (95% CI [-0.109, -0.042]), accounting for 12.1% of the total effect. Social support also served as an independent mediator (beta = -0.161, 95% CI [-0.216, -0.112]), explaining 26.2% of the total effect. In addition, music therapy and social support jointly played a chained mediating role (beta = -0.029, 95% CI [-0.049, -0.014]), accounting for 4.8% of the total effect. Conclusion Mindfulness can alleviate adolescent test anxiety both directly and indirectly through music therapy and social support. This study reveals the potential mechanisms of mindfulness-based interventions and provides theoretical and practical implications for school-based mental health education. Especially in resource-limited settings, promoting mindfulness training and music therapy appears to be a feasible and valuable intervention strategy.

TI  - Feasibility and Acceptability of a Family-Based Telehealth Intervention for Families Impacted by the Child Welfare System: Formative Mixed Methods Evaluation
T2  - JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Despite elevated rates of trauma exposure, substance misuse, mental health problems, and suicide, systems-impacted teens and their caregivers have limited access to empirically supported behavioral health services. Family-based interventions are the most effective for improving mental health, education, substance use, and delinquency outcomes, yet the familial and placement disruption that occurs during child welfare involvement can interfere with the delivery of family-based interventions.Objective: To address this gap in access to services, we adapted an in-person, empirically supported, family-based affect management intervention using a trauma-informed lens to be delivered via telehealth to families impacted by the child welfare system (Family Telehealth Project). We describe the intervention adaptation process and an open trial to evaluate its feasibility, acceptability, and impact.Methods: Adaptations to the in-person, family-based affect management intervention were conducted iteratively with input from youth, caregivers, and systems partners. Through focus groups and collaborative meetings with systems partners, a caregiver-only version of the intervention was also developed. An open trial of the intervention was conducted to assess family perspectives of its acceptability and feasibility and inform further refinements prior to a larger-scale evaluation. Participants included English-speaking families involved in the child welfare system in the past 12 months with teens (aged 12-18 years). Caregivers were eligible to participate either individually (caregivers of origin, kinship caregivers, or foster parents; n=7) or with their teen (caregiver of origin only; n=6 dyads). Participants completed session feedback forms and surveys at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 3-month posttreatment time points. Qualitative exit interviews were conducted with a subset of participants (12/19, 63%) to further understand their experiences with the intervention.Results: Session attendance was high, and both caregivers and teens reported high acceptability of clinicians and sessions on feedback forms. Families were comfortable with video technology, with very few (<5%) sessions having reported technology problems. Thematic analysis of exit interview transcripts indicated that families used effective communication and affect management skills taught during the intervention. Regarding challenges and barriers, some caregiver-only participants expressed a desire to have their teen also participate in the intervention. All interview participants reported that they would recommend the intervention to others and perceptions of the intervention were overwhelmingly positive. Quantitative surveys revealed differential responses to the intervention regarding affect management and communication.Conclusions: An open trial of the Family Telehealth Project, a skills-based telehealth intervention for families impacted by the child welfare system, suggests high levels of intervention feasibility and acceptability. Participants noted improvements in areas often hindered by the impacts of trauma and family separation: communication and affect management. Perceptions of the intervention were positive overall for both teens and caregivers. The Family Telehealth Project shows promise in addressing the gaps in behavioral health access for systems-impacted families.

TI  - Mental health literacy: A systematic review of knowledge and beliefs about mental disorders in Malaysia
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Mental health problems in Malaysia are on a rise. This study aimed at performing a systematic review of mental health literacy (MHL) in Malaysia.Methods Medline, Embase, ERIC/Proquest, ScienceDirect, Pubmed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Scopus, EBM Reviews - Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Emcare and reference lists of included studies were searched in February 2020. Studies that evaluated at least one of the main components of MHL, including (1) knowledge related to mental health issues, and (2) stigma, were included irrespective of study design. As secondary findings, the review also synthesized results related to facilitators and barriers to seeking mental health services. Depending on the research design, the quality of each study was assessed through checklists.Results Forty six studies published between 1995 to 2019 were included. Most studies used cross-sectional designs to investigate MHL. Findings indicate that most Malaysians have stigmatizing attitudes towards mental health problems. Participants in the included studies endorsed multifactorial explanations of mental health issues with a dominance of supernatural and religious aetiologies. Likewise, the commonest barrier was considering sources other than professional sources of mental-health services. Presence of adequate knowledge and considering providers as competent facilitated help-seeking. Additionally, there was considerable heterogeneity in studies and a lack of standardized measures assessing MHL.Conclusions There is an increase in studies on MHL in Malaysia. A few of these studies, based on experimental design, have shown positive effects. Researchers, practitioners, and policymakers should develop standardized measures and interventional studies based on all the components of MHL.

T2  - YOUTH & SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study, using a sample of 481 adolescents, aims to explore the relationship between ego-identity and problematic short video use in an online learning environment. The findings reveal that: (1) academic procrastination plays a significant mediating role in the relationship between ego-identity and problematic short video use; (2) both psychological resilience and academic procrastination function as a chain mediation between ego-identity and problematic short video use; and (3) there is a significant nonlinear relationship between psychological resilience and problematic short video use. This research provides a novel perspective for understanding the relationship between adolescents' mental health and problematic behaviors. The results offer important insights for informing mental health education practices and designing effective intervention strategies.

M3  - research-article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to explore adolescent depression, increase understanding of social problems, and develop prevention and intervention strategies. As a research method, social big data was used to collect information related to 'youth depression', and related factors were identified through data mining and analysis of related rules. We used 'Sometrend Biz Tool' to collect and clean data from the web and then analyzed data in various languages. The study found that online articles about depression decreased during the school holidays (January to March), then increased from March to the end of June, and then decreased again from July. Therefore, it is important to establish a government-wide depression management monitoring system that can detect risk signs of adolescent depression in real time. In addition, regular stress relief and mental health education are needed during the semester, and measures must be prepared to deal with at-risk youth who share their depressed feelings in cyberspace. Results from these studies can be expected to provide important information in investigating and preventing youth depression and to contribute to policy development and intervention.

TI  - 'Navigating a lonely road to adulthood with an ever-changing map'; a framework and case study protocol exploring the transition to adulthood, mental health literacy and occupational balance among Swedish young adults
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Recent reports point to a global and Swedish national mental health crisis among young adults. It is widely recognised that this phase of 'emerging adulthood' involves many challenges, stressors and uncertainties that can negatively impact mental health and well-being. In addition, these strains may be exacerbated by rapid contemporary changes in technological, societal and sociocultural contexts. Developing and tailoring interventions bolstering the mental well-being of young adults requires deeper insights into their lived experiences, self-perceived strengths and challenges.Aim This paper has two interconnected purposes: Firstly, presenting relevant theories and theoretical perspectives at the individual, group and societal levels providing a rationale for theorised study propositions underpinning a situational analysis of Swedish young adults. Secondly, building on this theoretical foundation, the aim is to describe a protocol for a case study and situational analysis examining how Swedish young adults from Generation Z experience their transition to adulthood, its impacts on their mental health, describing their mental health literacy, occupational balance, and support needs.Method This case study protocol outlines a holistic, single-case study design employing a flexible approach. Data will be collected in Sweden through focus groups and individual interviews with stakeholders, young adults, and their parents. Existing and available mental health and well-being promotion in Sweden will be mapped through online searches. The various data sources will initially be analysed separately using thematic analysis. Subsequently the subthemes and themes will be jointly analysed across participant groups using pattern matching in workshop formats.Conclusions The results of this case-study are expected to generate new knowledge of the reasons underpinning the increase in mental ill-health among young adults in Sweden. This knowledge will subsequently inform the future co-production and core design features of a digital mental e-health intervention aimed at promoting mental well-being among Swedish young adults aged 18-29.

TI  - Psychoeducation in School-Based Mental Health: Youth and Caregiver Insights for a Digital App
T2  - CHILD PSYCHIATRY & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Given the ongoing youth mental health crisis amid limited resources, young people and their families need sustainable, low-cost school-based interventions to support their wellbeing and connect them to vital services. As a first developmental phase of a clinical trial to integrate innovative digital mental health intervention into high schools, we first sought to understand the lived experience of students and parents. This study used qualitative methods to analyze diverse high school student, young adult, and parent reports of accessing in-person school-based mental health supports and use of health-related apps. Two-thirds of young people reported using health-related apps with common use related to entertainment, fitness, and mental health. Further qualitative analysis regarding access identified themes around availability, experience with services, and normalizing mental health vs. stigma in schools. Findings suggest opportunities for digital interventions to increase mental health literacy and address stigma through psychoeducation. Digital health tools may support schools as an adjunct to in-person services in reaching under-resourced students in need.

TI  - Adolescents Identify Modifiable Community-Level Barriers to Accessing Mental Health and Addiction Services in a Rural Canadian Town: A Survey Study
T2  - PEDIATRIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to inadequate provision of mental health and addictions care, as services have been traditionally conceptualized to serve the needs of children or adults. Additionally, rural communities have been largely excluded from research investigating mental healthcare access and exhibit unique barriers that warrant targeted interventions. Finally, perspectives from the target population will be most important when understanding how to optimize adolescent mental health and addictions care. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify what adolescents in a rural town perceive as barriers to accessing mental health services. We conducted a cross-sectional survey study with high school students to generate ranked lists of the top perceived individual-level, community-level, and overall barriers. A total of 243 high school students responded to the survey. Perceived barriers were predominantly at the community level. Overall, the top barriers reported were a lack of awareness and education regarding mental health, resources, and the nature of treatment. Students who had previously accessed mental health services identified primary barriers related to mental health professionals, whereas students who had not accessed care reported fear and uncertainty as primary barriers. Modifiable community-level factors related to (1) mental health literacy and (2) mental healthcare professionals were identified by adolescents as the main perceived barriers to accessing mental health and addiction services in a rural town. The findings of this preliminary study should inform intervention strategies and further rigorous research for this traditionally underserved target population.

AB  - Emotional and behavioral problems (EBP) are the main factors that make adolescents vulnerable to health risk behaviors like self -injury. This study aims to determine the relationship of EBP with self -injury in adolescents. The study used a descriptive correlative design with a cross-sectional approach. This research applied purposive and stratified -cluster sampling techniques involving 263 Senior High School (SHS) adolescents in West Jakarta. Data were obtained by using Strength -and -Difficulties Questionnaire and Deliberate Self -Harm Inventory questionnaire. The majority of adolescents have a normal level of self -injurious behavior of 52.5%. The EBP that the adolescents have been in the normal range of 62.4%. EBP has a significant relationship with self -injury in adolescents (p =0.000). This research is expected to be used as a foundation of promotion and prevention programs regarding self -injury and EBP in adolescents, such as mental health education, Coping -Skills Training, and Cognitive Behavior Therapy.

TI  - Effects of online continuum and categorical belief manipulations on schizophrenia stigma, help-seeking, and help-provision
T2  - PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Most research investigating the effect of continuum beliefs on stigma has used weak manipulations which may contribute to mixed findings within the experimental literature. There is also a lack of research into how continuum belief manipulations may impact help-seeking and help-provision. This study used an online manipulation of continuum and categorical beliefs about schizophrenia to examine the subsequent impacts on stigma, help-seeking, and help-provision. A total of 271 participants were randomised into either a continuum, categorical, or control condition. Participants received an informational video, a magazine article, and research highlights relevant to their condition. Prosocial support behaviour was assessed through a novel volunteering measure. The magnitude of change between pre-intervention and post-intervention measures of continuum and categorical beliefs was large. Continuum presentations reduced prognostic pessimism and negative stereotyping. Meanwhile, categorical presentations increased prognostic pessimism. Participants across conditions showed increased help-providing intentions after removing the highest scores to avoid ceiling effects. Fear and blame also decreased significantly across all conditions. There was no difference between conditions on our novel volunteer help-provision measure. Our findings have implications for anti-stigma programs and may help inform the design of future continuum belief manipulations.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the effects of "Healing Space," a co-production- and school-based initiative aimed at promoting positive psychosocial health among secondary school students in Hong Kong. Designed according to the Self-Determination Theory, Healing Space sought to enhance positive mental health attitudes, psychological well-being, and social connectedness among participants. Using a two-wave quasi-experimental design, students completed baseline and post-test assessments using standardized measurements based on their program participation (service co-producer group: n = 171; service user group: n = 400; waitlisted control group: n = 348). The results demonstrated significant interaction effects between 'time' and 'group' on self-compassion and mental illness-related self-stigma, with participants in the service co-producer and service user group showing a faster rate of change compared to the control group. There were no statistically significant differences between the service co-producer and service user group, suggesting that Healing Space exerted a comparable influence on both groups of students. Additionally, the program did not yield statistically significant findings in indicators of social connectedness. Implications for research, practice, and policy are discussed.

TI  - "Me" Versus "Them": How Mental Illness Stigma Influences Adolescent Help-Seeking Behaviors for Oneself and Recommendations for Peers
T2  - STIGMA AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mental illness stigma is a significant barrier to utilizing mental health services for young populations. Few studies have evaluated how specific stigma dimensions relate to help-seeking and recommendations among adolescents. We examined how the stigma dimensions of labeling, stereotypes, and separation/discrimination influenced self-reported help-seeking behaviors of adolescents and recommendations for hypothetical peers with a mental health problem. Longitudinal data (four assessments) from a study evaluating the effectiveness of three antistigma interventions (curriculum, contact, materials, vs. control) among adolescents were analyzed (n = 396). Help-seeking outcomes comprised services in formal (e.g., doctor), informal (e.g., friend), or school-based (e.g., school counselor) settings. Generalized estimating equations tested associations of labeling, stereotypes, and separation/discrimination on help-seeking for a personal problem and recommendations for vignette characters described as having bipolar depression or social anxiety disorder. Adolescents were more likely to make help-seeking recommendations for peers with mental health problems than they were to seek help for a problem of their own. Labeling was a strong predictor of self-reported help-seeking and recommendations. Mental health literacy, an indicator for low negative stereotypes, was related to increased recommendations but not self-reported help-seeking. Positive stigma action and awareness-high cognizance of stigma and how to engage in proactive behaviors toward treating and destigmatizing mental illness-increased help-seeking in formal and informal settings for oneself. Finally, separation/discrimination did not prevent self-reported help-seeking, but it did increase peer recommendations in certain settings. Stigma did not always influence or interfere with help-seeking in the same way when the help-seeker was oneself versus a peer.

TI  - Family Talk versus usual services in improving child and family psychosocial functioning in families with parental mental illness: a randomised controlled trial and cost analysis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Parental mental illness (PMI) is common and places children at high risk of developing psychological disorders. Family Talk (FT) is a well-known, whole-family, 7-session intervention designed to reduce the risk of transgenerational psychopathology. However, very few larger-scale evaluations of FT (across only a limited number of settings) have been conducted to date while there have been no cost analyses. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and costs of delivering FT in improving child and family psychosocial functioning in families with PMI within routine mental health settings. Methods A total of 83 families with PMI, with children aged 5-18 years, were randomly assigned on a 2:1 ratio to receive either the FT intervention (n=55 families) or usual services (n=28 families) across 10 adult, child and primary care mental health sites in Ireland. Parental disorders included anxiety/depression (57%), Bipolar Disorder (20%), Borderline Personality Disorder (12%), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (8%) and psychosis (2%). Detailed assessments with parents were conducted at baseline and 6-month follow up. Results FT led to significant improvements in family functioning and child behaviour at 6-month follow up when compared to usual services, with medium effect sizes indicated. Parent participants with lower mental health literacy at baseline also showed significant post-intervention improvements. Those parents with less severe mental illness at baseline, and families with more partner and economic supports, reported additional significant post-intervention improvements in child depression/anxiety and parental mental health symptoms. The cost of FT amounted to euro761.50 per family, although this decreased to euro415.31 when recurring costs only were included. Conclusion The findings from this study, which was conducted within the context of a national programme to introduce family-focused practice in Ireland, demonstrate that FT is a low-cost intervention that improved child and family psychosocial functioning across different mental health disorders within routine adult, child and primary care mental health services. The findings contribute to the growing evidence base for FT, and provide a robust basis to inform practice and policy development for families with parental mental illness both in Ireland and elsewhere.

TI  - Comparative Effectiveness of Mental Health Simulation Techniques in Nursing Education: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH NURSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Simulation-based training in mental health is increasingly recognised as an effective tool within nursing education. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of various simulation modalities, including standardised participants (SPs), role-plays, virtual reality (VR), mannequins and voice simulations, in improving educational outcomes for nursing students. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify studies evaluating the impact of mental health simulation on nursing education. Data from 62 studies were extracted and analysed. The primary outcomes included knowledge, confidence, self-efficacy, competence and anxiety. Meta-analyses assessed both pretest/posttest changes and comparisons between simulation and control groups. Pretest/posttest analyses revealed significant improvements across multiple modalities: SPs enhanced knowledge (SMD = 1.26), confidence (SMD = 1.20), self-efficacy (SMD = 0.94), attitude (SMD = 0.22), competence (SMD = 2.30) and anxiety reduction (SMD = -0.88). Role-plays demonstrated gains in knowledge (SMD = 0.87), confidence (SMD = 1.24), self-efficacy (SMD = 0.74), attitude (SMD = 0.53), competence (SMD = 0.82) and reduced anxiety (SMD = -0.73). VR improved knowledge (SMD = 0.86), self-efficacy (SMD = 0.75) and competence (SMD = 0.69). Mannequins showed no significant changes in knowledge or competence. Voice simulations improved knowledge (SMD = 0.96). Comparisons with control groups indicated that SPs significantly increased knowledge (SMD = 1.31), competence (SMD = 1.51) and reduced anxiety (SMD = -2.01). Role-plays enhanced knowledge (SMD = 1.03) compared with inactive controls; VR increased knowledge (SMD = 0.86) compared with controls. Mannequins showed no significant differences, and voice simulations lacked sufficient data for comprehensive analysis. This meta-analysis underscores the value of simulation-based training in mental health nursing education, with SPs proving particularly effective in enhancing clinical preparedness. Role-plays, VR and voice simulations offer supplementary benefits but may require integration with more interactive methods for optimal impact. Future research should prioritise high-quality randomised controlled trials, standardised simulation protocols and long-term follow-up to clarify the sustained effects of simulation training on clinical practice.

TI  - A research approach for co-designing education with healthcare consumers
T2  - MEDICAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Community and consumer involvement in health professions education (HPE) is of growing interest among researchers and educators, particularly in preparing health care graduates to effectively learn from, and collaborate with, people with lived experience of health issues. However, to date there has been limited direction on methodological approaches to engage health care consumers in the research and co-design of HPE.Approach In this paper, we describe the background to our work with health care consumers including the five core principles for successful co-design (inclusive; respectful; participative; iterative; outcomes focused) and how they can be applied as a research approach in HPE. We introduce the use of arts and humanities-based teaching methodologies including engagement, meaning-making and translational education strategies to illustrate how this research approach has been applied to reframe mental health education and practice in Australia. Furthermore, we share some reflective insights on the opportunities and challenges inherent in using a co-design research approach in HPE.Conclusions For the consumer voice to be embedded across HPE, there needs to be a collective commitment to curriculum redesign. This paper advances our understandings of the educational research potential of working with health care consumers to co-design rich and authentic learning experiences in HPE. Co-design research approaches that partner with and legitimise health care consumers as experts by experience may better align education and health professional practice with consumers' actual needs, an important first step in transforming hierarchical health care relationships towards more humanistic models of care.

M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Project Summary/Abstract (30 lines):Many individuals with psychotic disorders report having experienced subthreshold clinical highrisk (CHR) symptoms in adolescence. Identification and engagement of youth in early stages ofpsychosis can facilitate symptom monitoring, and early treatment maximizes recovery. Thepurpose of this study is to identify psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents who present withnew-onset CHR symptoms and enroll them and their caregivers in a brief treatmentengagement intervention. The specific aims are to: 1) develop a brief family-based interventionand pilot the intervention in a randomized control trial (RCT); 2) evaluate the engagement oftherapeutic mechanisms presumed to underlie the intervention; and 3) evaluate the relationsbetween the proposed mechanisms and service use. The proposed intervention includes threeevidence-based modules: assessment, psychoeducation, and motivational enhancement. Threepurported underlying mechanisms will be targeted: mental health literacy, attitudes towardtreatment, and family partnership. Content will be reinforced after discharge using an existingmobile platform designed to enhance the scope and reach of the intervention (e.g., trackreferrals, monitor symptoms, and provide ongoing access to materials). In order to develop andadapt the intervention to the inpatient setting, evidence-based content will be piloted withidentified teens and parents, and qualitative interviews will be conducted to explore opinionsregarding intervention content and delivery. This pilot will be conducted with parents and teens(n = 16-30 dyads) using an iterative approach to finalize content. Next, an RCT will beconducted with a larger sample (n = 80 dyads), and outcomes, measured at 1- and 3-monthfollow-ups, will be compared to a treatment-as-usual group. Primary outcomes will beengagement of the purported therapeutic mechanisms (i.e. mental health literacy, attitudestoward treatment, family partnership). Secondary outcomes include outpatient service use andcompletion of referral to the state’s coordinated specialty care (CSC) clinic, an early psychosisprogram offering outpatient case management to support service transitions and ongoingmonitoring. The broad goals of this study are to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of thebrief intervention, and to explore the intervention’s engagement of mechanisms and influenceon service use outcomes. The proposed study is innovative because it offers specializedintervention for CHR starting on an adolescent inpatient unit and continuing after discharge witha symptom monitoring family support program. The novel intervention program may enhancelinkage to ongoing mental health care, a step that is crucial for improving CHR outcomes.

T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveThe objective is to explore the barriers and facilitators experienced by mental health care professionals in providing mental health services to Omani children and adolescents.MethodsA qualitative descriptive study with semi-structured face-to-face interviews was conducted on a purposive sample of sixteen mental health professionals from a tertiary care psychiatric hospital in Oman. Audio recordings were transcribed verbatim, and the anonymized transcripts were processed with Delve Tool, a qualitative data analysis software that streamlines thematic analysis.ResultsBarriers to access mental health services were- institutional system and policy limitations; specialized workforce deficiency; lack of systemic interagency coordination; logistical barriers, language barriers, resistance to treatment, inefficient facility design, and cultural stigma. Facilitators were - integrated team-based care; telemedicine and public awareness campaigns; existing expertise and integrated services model.ConclusionThis study highlights the urgent need for action in ways to expand mental health education, and breakdown the stigma that often prevents people from seeking help. By integrating care models and ensuring that professionals receive ongoing training, the existing gaps can be closed and mental health services can be made more effective.

Content will be reinforced after discharge using an existingmobile platform designed to enhance the scope and reach of the intervention (e.g., trackreferrals, monitor symptoms, and provide ongoing access to materials). In order to develop andadapt the intervention to the inpatient setting, evidence-based content will be piloted withidentified teens and parents, and qualitative interviews will be conducted to explore opinionsregarding intervention content and delivery. This pilot will be conducted with parents and teens(n = 16-30 dyads) using an iterative approach to finalize content. Next, an RCT will beconducted with a larger sample (n = 80 dyads), and outcomes, measured at 1- and 3-monthfollow-ups, will be compared to a treatment-as-usual group. Primary outcomes will beengagement of the purported therapeutic mechanisms (i.e. mental health literacy, attitudestoward treatment, family partnership). Secondary outcomes include outpatient service use andcompletion of referral to the state’s coordinated specialty care (CSC) clinic, an early psychosisprogram offering outpatient case management to support service transitions and ongoingmonitoring. The broad goals of this study are to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of thebrief intervention, and to explore the intervention’s engagement of mechanisms and influenceon service use outcomes. The proposed study is innovative because it offers specializedintervention for CHR starting on an adolescent inpatient unit and continuing after discharge witha symptom monitoring family support program. The novel intervention program may enhancelinkage to ongoing mental health care, a step that is crucial for improving CHR outcomes.

TI  - Adolescent peer support for mental health problems: evaluation of the validity and reliability of the Mental Health Support Scale for Adolescents
T2  - BMC PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe Mental Health Support Scale for Adolescents (MHSSA) is a criterion-referenced measure of adolescents' supportive intentions towards peers with mental health problems, which was developed for use in evaluations of adolescent mental health interventions, such as the teen Mental Health First Aid (tMHFA) program. The present study aimed to examine the validity and reliability of the MHSSA.MethodsA sample of 3092 school students (Mean & PLUSMN; SD: 15.9 & PLUSMN; 0.4 years old) and 65 tMHFA Instructors (the adult group with known expertise in tMHFA) completed the 12 items of the MHSSA. A sub-sample of 1201 students repeated the scale after a 3-4-week interval. Item concordance rates with the tMHFA Action Plan across helpful and harmful intentions scales were calculated. Scale reliabilities were assessed using agreement coefficients from a single test administration and test-retest reliability measured by intraclass correlation coefficients. The mean differences of MHSSA scores of students and Instructors were compared using independent samples t-tests, while convergent validity was tested via correlations of the scale with validated measures of confidence in providing help, social distance and personal stigma.ResultsThe average score of Instructors was significantly higher than that of students. The scale was positively associated with confidence in providing help, whilst negatively associated with social distance and dimensions of personal stigma. All scales of MHSSA had high agreement coefficients (all > 0.80) and fair to good test-retest reliability over 3-4 weeks.ConclusionsThe MHSSA shows evidence of validity and reliability for use among adolescents for evaluating the quality of intentions to help peers with mental health problems.

TI  - IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND LOCKDOWNS ON THE EDUCATION AND MENTAL HEALTH OF PHYSIOTHERAPY STUDENTS IN FRANCE: A DESCRIPTIVE CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY WITH NATIONAL ONLINE SURVEY
T2  - JOURNAL OF REHABILITATION MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To determine the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic and lockdowns on the mental health status, training, perceptions of the physiotherapy profession, and career plans of French physiotherapy students.Design: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted, representing the first and only survey of its kind, using a national online survey.Subjects: A total of 2678 French physiotherapy stu-dents participated in the study.Methods: Mental health status was assessed using the validated French versions of established depres-sion, anxiety, and insomnia scales.Results: The survey revealed that female sex, age below 21 years, living alone, and having a psychiatric history or COVID-19 risk factors were associated with more severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia in the surveyed students. In addition, stress, anxiety, and depression induced by the COVID-19 crisis were linked to apprehension about continuing practical training in physiotherapy. These factors also affected students' perceptions of the profession and the initially envisioned mode of practice, particularly among fifth-year students (odds ratio (OR) = 2.25, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = (1.69, 2.99), p < 0.001). Notably, the pandemic significantly reduced the desire of these students to pursue a career as physiotherapists (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.41 (1.06, 1.86)).Conclusion: French physiotherapy students, especially those in their fifth year, have experienced signi-ficant impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, affecting their mental health, education, perceptions of the physiotherapy profession, and career plans.

TI  - Addressing Youth Mental Health Through Schools and Primary Care Clinics Using the Connected for Wellness Mobile App: Protocol for a Stepped-Wedge Trial
T2  - JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Youth in the United States are experiencing rising rates of anxiety, depression, and other mental health challenges, yet many remain underserved due to systemic barriers such as poverty, limited access to care, and shortages in the mental health workforce. Schools and primary care clinics are trusted, community-based settings that offer strategic opportunities for early identification, prevention, and intervention. As part of a public health approach, integrating digital mental health tools into these settings can support broad access, enhance mental health literacy, and promote help-seeking behaviors among all students. When co-designed with youth and embedded within existing care systems, thesetools offer a scalable, proactive solution to support well-being across diverse school-aged populations. Objective: This protocol describes the design and implementation of a stepped-wedge clinical trial to evaluate the Connected for Wellness mobile app, a youth-and caregiver-facing digital mental health intervention. Developed using participatory informatics and human-centered design principles, the app provides culturally relevant content in English and Spanish. Features include self-guided wellness activities, well-being screeners, psychoeducational videos, and localized service directories. Machine learning algorithms personalize content recommendations based on user inputs and behavioral patterns. Methods: This trial uses a stepped-wedge cluster randomized design across 20 community-based sites (10 high schoolsand 10 primary care clinics) in 2 counties in California. These counties were selected for their high proportions of underserved youth populations. All youth aged 13 to 22 years and their caregivers will be invited to access the app. Sites are randomized into 2 implementation waves. The app is introduced site-wide as a universal public health intervention supported by on-site navigators and peer ambassadors. The primary outcomesare derived from a cascade-of-care framework, including identification of mental health need, referral to services, initiation of services, and engagement (defined as >= 3 treatment visits). Data will be collected via anonymous in-app analytics, monthly World Health Organization-Five Well-Being Index assessments, and deidentified electronic health and administrative records. Generalized linear mixed models will be used to evaluate differences in cascade outcomes between pre-and postimplementation phases while accounting for clustering and site-level variability. Results: As of May 2025, the mobile app has been finalized, institutional review board approvals have been secured, and all study sites have been recruited. Participant recruitment is projected to begin in August 2025. Data collection and initial analyses will begin in early 2026, with preliminary findings expected by October 2026. Conclusions: This study tests a novel digital health intervention integrated into trusted care systems. If effective, the Connected for Wellness mobile app may serve as a scalable strategy to reduce disparities in mental health care access and engagement for youth across the United States.

TI  - Mental Health of Nursing Students: A Bibliometric Review Based on CiteSpace Visual Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF NURSING MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: The mental health of nursing students directly affects their future performance, quality of patient care, and personal development. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of research in this area can assist in implementing effective measures to improve the mental health of nursing students.Aim: This study used bibliometric analyses to identify and analyze articles, authors, journals, and research institutes investigating nursing students' mental health in terms of thematic structure and topic evolution, aiming to provide direction and guidance for future research.Methods: In this retrospective bibliometric analysis, data were downloaded from the Web of Science Core Collection on August 15, 2024. Subsequently, CiteSpace software was employed to analyze the annual number of publications and citations, explore relationships between authors, institutions, countries, and keywords, and summarize research hotspots and frontiers in the field of nursing students' mental health.Results: Articles published from database inception to August 15, 2024, were screened, leading to the retrieval of 3803 relevant articles. The United States of America was the leading country in terms of research output on the mental health of nursing students, with 982 (25.79%) published articles, while the United States Department of Health and Human Services provided the most funding. Furthermore, Happell, B was the most productive author in this field, with 80 published papers. Lastly, Nurse Education Today was the most prolific journal in nursing education.Conclusion: The main recent research trends include the psychological profile of nursing students, intervention strategies for improving the mental health of nursing students, and the influence of educational methods, clinical experience, and humanistic care on the mental health of nursing students. These trends imply that researchers should develop targeted training programs, apply information technology, and implement personalized teaching to enhance the psychological resilience of the nursing student population. Moreover, higher education institutions should provide nursing students with more comprehensive and effective mental health support by maintaining mental health files, strengthening mental health education, providing psychological counseling services, and establishing social support systems.

TI  - Break Binge Eating: Reach, engagement, and user profile of anInternet-basedpsychoeducational and self-help platform for eating disorders
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EATING DISORDERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Internet-based psychoeducational and self-help platforms hold promise for alleviating existing help-seeking barriers and addressing the unmet needs of people with eating disorders (EDs). In this paper, we report data related to the reach, engagement, and visitor profile ofBreak Binge Eating, an online platform designed to provide evidence-based information and self-help strategies for people at all stages of an ED. Method Two sources of data were presented: (a) usage data from platform visitors generated through Google Analytics; and (b) characteristics of a sample of platform visitors (n= 786). Results In 13 months, approximately 46,311 unique users worldwide have accessed this platform, with usage rates rapidly increasing each month. Most visitors came from organic searches (when ED-related information is directly searched in a browser). Self-help content was the most accessed material, and 81% of the sample stated that their reason for accessing the platform was to get help. Sample visitors were highly symptomatic; 52% met criteria resembling a threshold ED and 87% engaged in at least one ED behavior in the past month. Across different symptomatic subgroups, similar to 50% were unsure whether they needed help, similar to 80% were not receiving any help, and similar to 75% were highly concerned with their symptoms. Conclusion This online platform has broad reach and is engaging its intended audience. It is an aim of this platform to improve mental health literacy, facilitate symptom recognition and improvement, and alleviate help-seeking barriers. Evaluating whether this platform is achieving its intended aims in a randomized controlled trial is the next step.

TI  - Teaching DBT Skills to DACA Recipients and their Families: Findings from an ECHO Program.
T2  - Practice innovations (Washington, D.C.)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) offers temporary administrative relief from deportation for undocumented immigrant adolescents and young adults who were brought as children to the United States. Accordingly, DACA has contributed to creating a different landscape of opportunities for this group. However, DACA has been and continues to be highly contested in the national political climate. Threats to DACA give rise to considerable anxiety, fear, and distress among its recipients, who face significant barriers to accessing mental health care services. Thus, a group of psychologists partnered with a leading immigrant rights advocacy organization and formed a reciprocal collaboration to understand and meet the mental health needs of undocumented communities. A major focus of the collaboration is to foster learning and support members of the immigrant community in contributing to their own well-being. The collaborative developed and delivered a stand-alone web-based mental health education session to DACA recipients and their families and practitioners serving this population. The session presented the use of dialectical behavioral therapy skills, three emotion regulation and four distress tolerance skills, as a strength-based approach to managing painful emotions and distress. Session content was adapted to include culturally informed examples for each skill. Quantitative and qualitative findings show that those who participated in the web-based program benefited from the education received. Findings also underscored participants' need for learning culturally sensitive coping strategies for managing stress. We provide recommendations on the delivery of culturally congruent healing interventions for immigrants with a focus on enhancing access among immigrant communities.

TI  - Youth Engagement in School Mental Health Teaming: Structure, Processes, and Outcomes of a Youth Leadership Academy to Promote Emotional Well-Being in Schools
T2  - BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: It is essential that leaders in education and behavioral health partner with youth to build Comprehensive School Mental Health (CSMH) systems. One mechanism to elevate youth perspectives in CSMH system building is by engaging youth as members of CSMH teams. Method: The current study describes the structure, process and impact of a school-based Youth Leadership Academy (YLA) that integrated youth leaders into CSMH teams with state, district, and school leaders. The YLA offered student leaders opportunities to (1) receive training and mentorship to enhance their capacities to serve as leaders on CSMH teams, (2) provide input on CSMH priorities and (3) set MTSS goals to advance emotional well-being in schools. This study summarizes youth-driven multi-tiered systems of support (MTSS) goals and action plans by youth participants and the impact of youth participation in the YLA on indicators of positive youth development. Results: Youth most often contributed to planning and/or implementation of Tier 1-Universal Mental Health supports related to mental health literacy and school climate. Pre-post surveys revealed YLA participation was associated with statistically significant increases in youth reports of core social and emotional learning skills, positive identity, and contribution. Conclusions: Schools can replicate the YLA structure to enhance MTSS and foster youth leader skill development.

TI  - Brief admission by self-referral for adolescents who self-harm: discourses on involvement and responsibility among parents and other significant adults
T2  - CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY AND MENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundBrief Admission by self-referral (BA) was implemented in 2018 in Swedish child and adolescent psychiatric (CAP) inpatient care. This intervention empowers adolescents to self-admit at their own request for brief periods to prevent self-harm and suicidal crisis. As BA enhances healthcare user autonomy, it is a timely intervention to consider with the emerging human rights discourse and rising imperatives for person-centered care in psychiatry. The present study explores talk about adolescents access to BA specifically in terms of involvement and responsibilities of parents and other significant adults in CAP.MethodsIn this qualitative study, we interviewed 26 significant adults (the majority being biological parents) of children with access to BA. Interviews were semi-structured, asking broadly about participants' experiences with BA. We used reflexive thematic analysis from a social constructionist framework to explore how participants' narratives drew on existing psychiatric discourses.ResultsWe constructed four themes around narratives of involvement and responsibilities in BA specifically and CAP generally: there's no need to be involved in BA, selflessly supporting child involvement, being insufficiently involved, and being left to shoulder everything. These themes illustrate a sliding scale from perceiving little responsibility nor need for involvement, to perceiving shared responsibility for children's well-being but limited personal rights, to being under-involved and even perceptions of being left with sole responsibility as CAP refused to provide care.ConclusionsParticipants' narratives could generally be mapped onto rights-based discourse, emphasizing that adolescents should have access to BA as it helped them care for themselves. As participants took various positions regarding the responsibility of parents versus CAP to protect and help adolescents, the risk of perpetually downplaying the needs of parents and other significant adults became apparent, along with the pitfalls of neoliberal healthcare management and responsibilization of child mental health. CAP ought to systematically inform both adolescents and significant adults about BA, strengthening mental health literacy among the target population. It also ought to be emphasized that supporting significant others is considered part of the purpose with BA.

TI  - The psychosocial impacts of cybervictimisation and barriers to seeking social support: Young people's perspectives
T2  - CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - The negative impact of cyberbullying on the mental health of victims is well established. However, qualitative research related to the mental health impacts of cybervictimisation and how these are experienced by young people is scarce. In particular, little is known about young people's perceptions of the association between cyberbullying and suicidal behaviours. This paper reports findings on the mental health impacts of cyberbullying, and barriers to seeking social support, from eleven focus groups with 64 young people aged fourteen to seventeen (53% female), across four secondary schools. Thematic analysis identified two central themes: The Psychological Nature of Cyberbullying (sub-themes include Trapped by the Omni-Presence of Cyber Technology; Negative Overthinking; The Impacts of Negative Overthinking on Young People's Lives; and Suicide as a Means of Escape) and Barriers to Help-Seeking (including sub-themes Needing Help Regarded as Sign of Weakness; Young People Unable to Identify and Express Feelings; Lack of Confidence in Parents Ability to Provide Support; and Inappropriate School Intervention). Cyberbullying was described as more psychological in nature and impact than traditional bullying with increased deleterious effect on the mental health and wellbeing of victims. Victims experience rumination and worry fuelled by the omni-present, pervasive, and permanent nature of cyber interactions. Young people's inability to seek support maintains and exacerbates victims' distress. Participants perceived suicide as a viable escape route for young victims defeated and entrapped by cybervictimisation and their own negative thoughts. Interventions should address emotional competence and mental health literacy in young people, as well as empowering support networks including parents, peers, and school personnel, to foster an environment that promotes help-seeking.

TI  - Factors related to help-seeking and service utilization for professional mental healthcare among young people: An umbrella review
T2  - CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this umbrella review is to summarize evidence on factors that influence help-seeking and service utilization for professional mental healthcare among young people ages 0-30. The CINAHL, Cochrane, Epistemonikos, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science databases were searched in December 2023 for systematic reviews in English. The search yielded 26 eligible reviews, all of which are medium or high quality. Primary study overlap was rare. Using an established framework, we organize intrapersonal (n = 37), interpersonal (n = 14), institutional (n = 9), community (n = 7), and public policy (n = 6) factors. The most frequently reviewed factor at each level is trust of professionals (intrapersonal), close others' support for treatment (interpersonal), cost (institutional), availability (community), and insurance (public policy). Stigma is widely referenced (18 reviews) and classified as multi-dimensional. Narrative synthesis reveals populationspecific variability (e.g., rural, racial/ethnic minority, refugees, immigrants) in the importance of many factors. To develop interventions and healthcare systems sensitive to young people's needs, we recommend promoting stigma-reduction campaigns, and targeting trustworthiness, affordability, anonymity, accessibility, and mental health literacy. Identifying commonalities and differences across populations and contexts assists in the design of nuanced and efficient treatment delivery systems for young people, who are at a critical time for their mental health.

TI  - Paramedicine students' experiences on placement: preparedness for the emotional impacts of witnessing trauma
T2  - BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Paramedicine is a psychologically high-risk profession, with workers routinely exposed to fatalities and severe medical and emotional trauma. During their studies, paramedicine students undergo practical training with ambulance crews. Without experience, and often with limited emotional preparation, students are exposed to many of the same graphic and traumatic situations as working professionals. This qualitative social constructionist study explored the emotional impacts experienced during placement and students' emotional preparedness to cope with the challenges of placement. Findings revealed a range of significant emotional impacts reported by the participants. Initial anxiety was found to intensify the response to distressing incidents involving fatalities, severe injuries, domestic violence, and suicide-related incidents. In some cases, students reported ongoing, lingering emotional effects. Most students also felt that they were inadequately prepared for the emotional challenges of placement. A common recommendation among the participants was the inclusion of formal mental health education and resilience training prior to placement. Given the prior absence of research exploring the lived experiences of paramedic students on placement, the current findings add important depth and a student perspective. The implications of this research highlight an urgent need for a greater focus on students' emotional preparedness prior to placement training.

TI  - Diagnostic effectiveness of the Sport Mental Health Assessment Tool 1 supplemented with a brief clinical intake interview in a cohort of Polish elite Olympic athletes
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Several studies have used the Sport Mental Health Assessment Tool 1 (SMHAT-1) among athletes but none have combined SMHAT-1 with a subsequent clinical intake interview. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic effectiveness of SMHAT-1 supplemented by a brief, in-person clinical intake interview in evaluating the prevalence of mental health concerns in elite athletes.Methods Sections 1 and 2 from SMHAT-1 were administered in person during the routine biannual medical check-up for Olympic athletes at the National Centre for Sports Medicine in Poland. Immediately after completing the measures, all athletes were interviewed by qualified psychologists who evaluated their mental health and provided recommendations.Results A total of 1121 elite athletes (545 female, 576 male) aged 18-53 (M=24.39, SD=5.09) were evaluated 2-8months before the 2024 Paris Olympic Games; 72.4% scored above the triage threshold and 51% were positively screened in SMHAT-1's section 2. Based on the subsequent mental health evaluation, only 9.5% showed signs of persistent mental health concerns and required referral to a mental health specialist. In 24.2%, their distress levels/symptoms were assessed as occasional and normal in relation to demands, and they underwent a psychoeducational intervention or were advised to consult a sports psychologist. Female athletes scored significantly higher in most questionnaires.Conclusion SMHAT-1 proved a useful addition to the routine medical check-ups for elite athletes. Extending SMHAT-1 with a brief clinical intake interview substantially elevated the efficacy of the mental health evaluation, with an additional benefit of raising mental health literacy.

T2  - ARCHIVES OF SUICIDE RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective: An estimated 41,000 lives are lost to suicide each year in World Health Organization Eastern Mediterranean Region Office (WHO EMRO) countries. The objective of this study was to conduct a situation analysis for suicide and self-harm in the WHO EMRO region.Methods: Data on suicide were obtained from the WHO Global Health Estimates for the years 2000-2019. Information on risk groups efforts to prevent self-harm and suicide in the EMRO region were retrieved through scientific studies, grey literature, and public websites.Results: During 2000-2019, the age-standardized suicide rate was 6.7 per 100,000 inhabitants, albeit there are concerns regarding data quality. Self-harm and suicide remain criminal acts in more than half of the countries. Few countries have a national plan for prevention of suicide. Toxic agents, such as pesticides and black henna, are easily available and frequently used for suicide in some areas, as are firearms and self-immolation. Successful prevention measures include means restriction and psychosocial interventions after self-harm.Conclusion: Many WHO EMRO countries remain underserved in terms of mental health care. Decriminalization of suicide and means restriction might be further promoted. Online-based tools for mental health literacy and psychosocial therapy are other options to explore.

TI  - Views of young people in Malaysia on mental health, help-seeking and unusual psychological experiences
T2  - EARLY INTERVENTION IN PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Mental health problems are prevalent among young people in Malaysia yet access to specialist mental health care is extremely limited. More context-specific research is needed to understand the factors affecting help-seeking in youth, when mental health problems typically have first onset. We aimed to explore the attitudes of vulnerable young Malaysians regarding mental health problems including unusual psychological experiences, help-seeking and mental health treatment. Methods In the present study, nine young people (aged 16-23 years) from low-income backgrounds participated in a semi-structured interview about their perspectives on mental health problems, unusual psychological experiences and help-seeking. Results Four themes were developed using thematic analysis. "Is it that they [have] family problems?" reflected participants' explanatory models of mental health problems. "Maybe in Malaysia" was concerned with perceptions of Malaysian culture as both encouraging of open sharing of problems and experiences, but also potentially stigmatizing. "You have to ask for help" emphasized the importance of mental health help-seeking despite potential stigma. "It depends on the person" addressed the challenges of engaging with psychological therapy. Conclusions We conclude that young people in Malaysia may hold compassionate, non-stigmatizing views towards people experiencing mental health problems and a desire to increase their knowledge and understandings. Yet societal stigma is a perceived reputational risk that may affect mental health problem disclosure and help-seeking. We suggest that efforts to improve mental health literacy would be valued by young Malaysians and could support reduced stigma and earlier help-seeking.

TI  - Longitudinal Relationship Between Bullying Victimization and Depression Among Left-Behind Children: Roles of Negative Thoughts and Self-Compassion
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundLeft-behind children (LBC) in China have aroused widespread concern in society and the academic field because they have a high risk of psychological problems. For left-behind children, depression is the most serious problem. Bullying victimization has been evidenced as one of the most common causes of children's depression. However, less is known about its longitudinal association and the process for how bullying victimization influences depression among left-behind children. Thus, the presentation aims to explore the mechanisms underlying by considering the roles of left-behind children's negative thoughts and self-compassion. MethodsThe 3-wave longitudinal data were collected from a sample of 605 aged 8-11 from central China. We used the Olweus bully and victimization questionnaire, the children's automatic thoughts scale, the depression scale, and the self-compassion scale. ResultsBullying victimization positively predicted the depression level of left-behind children. Negative thoughts and self-compassion mediate the relationship between bullying victimization and depression. In the mechanism of bullying victimization on depression exists gender differences among left-behind children. ConclusionThe present study suggested the association between bullying victimization and left-behind children's depression and revealed the internal mechanism of negative thoughts and self-compassion. These findings provide a new perspective for left-behind children's mental health education and intervention.

TI  - A Systematic Review of Help-Seeking Barriers for Racial-Ethnic Minority Caregivers Accessing Autism Diagnostic and Intervention Services
T2  - JOURNAL OF RACIAL AND ETHNIC HEALTH DISPARITIES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Caregivers play an essential role in early help-seeking and intervention for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Caregivers, therefore, provide a crucial role in helping to address the racial and ethnic disparity identified in accessing ASD intervention and diagnostic services (Bejarano-Mart & iacute;n et al., Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders 50(9), 3380-3394, 2020). Unfortunately, racial-ethnic minority caregivers of children with autism (CCA) are less likely to contact a physician or healthcare professionals about their concerns and more likely to delay their contact to have their child evaluated (Zeleke et al., Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders 49(10), 4320-4331, 2019). However, little evidence exists to explain why such a gap exists in the help-seeking behaviors between White and racial-ethnic minority CCA. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a systematic literature review to identify articles that have studied barriers in help-seeking for racial-ethnic minority CCA. A broad literature search across four databases was conducted (i.e., PubMed, PsycINFO, Education Resources Information Center, and Child Development and Adolescent Studies). The coding team identified 17 articles on help-seeking barriers for racial-ethnic minority CCA. A thematic analysis was used to narratively synthesize the help-seeking barriers identified across these 17 studies. Four themes emerged from our findings: logistical barriers, provider competence, ASD literacy, and cultural stigma. We also provided clinical recommendations for healthcare providers working with families with racial-ethnic minority CCA.

TI  - Youth Mental Health Crisis Response: A Multiple Methods Study to Map Resources and Identify Facilitators and Barriers to Service Access
T2  - SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Youth mental health crises in the USA increased dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic. Schools are uniquely positioned to address the growing mental health needs of youth by connecting them with mental health services; however, they are often under-resourced to provide these services. This study used community resource mapping to identify the existence, distribution, and types of youth mental health crisis services available in the Boston area. Semi-structured interviews with school and community providers were conducted to examine the facilitators and barriers to youth mental health crisis service access. Findings show that while 23 programs were identified in Boston, there were gaps in terms of service availability by neighborhood, language accessibility, and type of crisis services provided. Thematic analysis of the qualitative interviews identified attitudinal and structural barriers to service utilization, including family stigma related to mental health diagnosis and services, resource accessibility and COVID-19 impacts, and the need for additional training and support for families and school-based staff. Findings demonstrate the need for cross-discipline school and community collaboration and culturally responsive mental health education and promotion.

TI  - Mental health and psychosocial interventions to limit the adverse psychological effects of disasters and emergencies in China: a scoping review
T2  - LANCET REGIONAL HEALTH-WESTERN PACIFIC
M3  - Review
AB  - Exposure to disasters and public health emergencies negatively affects mental health. Research documenting the psychosocial responses to these calamities in China increased dramatically after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. However, there is no comprehensive assessment of the available literature on China's mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) responses to these events. This scoping review systematically maps existing published research and grey literature sources regarding MHPSS to disasters and emergencies in China. We examined relevant literature in English and Chinese from six databases and official websites from Jan 1, 2000, to Aug 13, 2021, and included 77 full-text records in this review. The main types of interventions reported included a) stepped care intervention models, b) individual structured psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy, c) mental health education, d) psychological counselling, and e) government-based policy interventions. Most interventions were evaluated using quantitative methods that assessed the treatment of common mental disorders. The review found that rapid national mobilization, emphasis on resilience-strengthening interventions, and the widespread use of step-care models were essential components of reducing the adverse psychosocial effects of disasters. The review also identified remaining gaps, including a) a lack of integration of disaster-related services with the pre-existing health care system, b) inadequate supervision of MHPSS providers, and c) limited monitoring and evaluation of the services provided. These results show where additional research is needed in China to improve mental health services. It also provides a framework that other countries can adapt when developing and evaluating MHPSS policies and plans in response to disasters.

TI  - Attitudes of Jordanian Medical Students Toward People With Mental Illness.
T2  - Cureus
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background For people with mental illnesses, the stigma in the healthcare system and among healthcare providers has been identified as a major barrier to accessing treatment and achieving recovery, as well as poor physical treatment. This nationwide cross-sectional study assessed stigma toward mental illnesses among medical students in Jordan. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and patterns of stigma toward mental illnesses among medical students in Jordan and examine the influence of psychiatric education and specialty preferences on stigma levels. Methodology A nationwide cross-sectional study was conducted between April 21 and April 30, 2021, targeting medical students from all six medical schools in Jordan. Participants completed a validated, structured, electronically distributed questionnaire assessing attitudes toward mental illness. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) identified three key domains, i.e., (1) Social Acceptance, (2) Policies to Promote Community Integration, and (3) Beliefs about Treatability of Mental Illness. Demographic information included age, academic year (pre-clinical vs. clinical), and psychiatric training exposure (classroom and/or clinical). Data analysis was performed using SPSS (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). A total of 2,104 medical students participated. The age distribution was as follows: 24.8% were aged 18-19.9 years, 43.6% were aged 20-22.9 years, and 31.7% were aged ≥23 years. Participants included both pre-clinical and clinical-year students from diverse academic institutions across Jordan. Results Clinical-year students reported significantly higher (less stigmatizing) scores in all three domains compared to pre-clinical students (p < 0.001). Those exposed to both classroom and clinical psychiatry training showed more favorable attitudes than those with limited or no exposure. Students interested in psychiatry specialization exhibited lower (more stigmatizing) scores in the treatability and community integration domains compared to peers interested in surgical (p < 0.001, p = 0.003) and medical specialties (p < 0.001, p = 0.001). Conclusions While a majority of students expressed social acceptance and supported community integration of individuals with mental illness, stigma persisted in perceptions of treatability. Greater exposure to psychiatric education correlates with reduced stigma. Unexpectedly, students inclined toward psychiatry showed more stigmatizing views in some domains, warranting further investigation. These findings highlight the importance of enhancing mental health education across the medical curriculum.

TI  - What are the barriers, facilitators and interventions targeting help-seeking behaviours for common mental health problems in adolescents? A systematic review
T2  - BMC PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Increasing rates of mental health problems among adolescents are of concern. Teens who are most in need of mental health attention are reluctant to seek help. A better understanding of the help-seeking in this population is needed to overcome this gap. Methods Five databases were searched to identify the principal barriers, facilitators and interventions targeting help-seeking for common mental health problems in adolescents aged 10-19 years. The search was performed in June 2018 and updated in April 2019. Two independent screening processes were made using the eligibility criteria. Quality assessment of each study was performed, and findings summarised using a narrative synthesis. Results Ninety studies meet the inclusion criteria for this review for barrier and facilitators (n = 54) and interventions (n = 36). Stigma and negative beliefs towards mental health services and professionals were the most cited barriers. Facilitators included previous positive experience with health services and mental health literacy. Most interventions were based on psychoeducation, which focused on general mental health knowledge, suicide and self-harm, stigma and depression. Other types of interventions included the use of multimedia and online tools, peer training and outreach initiatives. Overall, the quality of studies was low to medium and there was no general agreement regarding help-seeking definition and measurements. Conclusion Most of the interventions took place in an educational setting however, it is important to consider adolescents outside the educational system. Encouraging help-seeking should come with the increased availability of mental health support for all adolescents in need, but this is still a major challenge for Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services. There is also a need to develop shared definitions, theoretical frameworks and higher methodological standards in research regarding help-seeking behaviours in adolescents. This will allow more consistency and generalisability of findings, improving the development of help-seeking interventions and ensuring timely access to mental health treatments.

TI  - The Effect of Stress on Depression in Postgraduate Students: Mediating Role of Research Self-Efficacy and Moderating Role of Growth Mindset
T2  - BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the relationship between stress and depression among postgraduate students, with a focus on the mediating role of research self-efficacy and the moderating role of growth mindset. A questionnaire survey was conducted among 2278 graduate students nationwide, utilizing the Mindset Scale, Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale, and Research Self-Efficacy Scale. Data were analyzed using SPSS 27.0 and AMOS 24.0. The results indicate the following: (1) Stress has a significant positive relationship with depression, while stress is negatively related to research self-efficacy, and research self-efficacy is negatively related to depression. (2) Research self-efficacy partially mediates the relationship between stress and depression, accounting for 35.6% of the total effect. (3) Growth mindset moderates both the relationship between stress and research self-efficacy and the relationship between research self-efficacy and depression. These findings reveal the mechanisms through which stress affects depression among graduate students, underscore the importance of mental health education, and provide scientific evidence for universities and educational institutions to design targeted prevention and intervention measures.

TI  - A Gamified Digital Mental Health Intervention Across Six Sub-Saharan African Countries: A Cross-Sectional Evaluation of a Large-Scale Implementation.
T2  - International journal of environmental research and public health
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Mental health conditions affect many young people in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where stigma is high and access to care is limited. Digital tools accessible on basic mobile phones offer a scalable way to promote mental health, but evidence on their effectiveness in SSA is limited. This study evaluated the reach, feasibility, acceptability, and knowledge outcomes of Digital MindSKILLZ, an interactive voice response (IVR) mental health intervention implemented in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Nigeria, Rwanda, Uganda, and Zambia. Over seven months, 700,138 people called the platform, and 425,395 (61%) listened to at least one message. Of these users, 63.6% were under 25 and 68.3% were from rural areas. The three content branches-mental health information, mental health skills, and soccer quizzes-were accessed by 36.5%, 46.4%, and 50.9% of users, respectively. Among users who accessed the mental health branch of the intervention, the mean number of messages completed was 7.6 out of 18 messages. In a follow-up survey, 91% of users understood the content, 85% would recommend the intervention, and 38% found the mental health content most helpful. Average knowledge scores were 62%, with lower scores on common disorders and stigma. The intervention showed strong reach and acceptability, but content and implementation improvements are needed to boost engagement and retention.

TI  - Developing a Medical Education Framework for Migrant and Refugee Mental Health in Switzerland
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives This study aimed to develop a medical education framework for migrant and refugee mental health in Switzerland, given substantial mental health challenges displaced people face along the phases of migration.Methods Through informants from Swiss medical faculties, we assessed the existence of a comprehensive curriculum in migrant and refugee mental health. The curriculum was drafted based on a selective literature analysis, then reviewed, and verified by a committee of 17 experts in mental health of refugees and migrants. Their inputs have been used towards the development of the final framework.Results No relevant comprehensive education framework existed, however, most medical schools provided related teaching. The literature analysis identified migration-related risk factors, social determinants and challenges when providing mental health to this population. Teaching methods included lectures, reflection rounds in small groups and practical experiences. The committee consisting of students, physicians and academics suggested a high level of approval for our initiative.Conclusion Our method followed a pragmatic approach to suggest an expert-approved curriculum. Due to its comprehensiveness, only parts of it may be adopted into already existing study programs.

TI  - Exploring the benefits and challenges of being a consumer educator in nursing education: A scoping review
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC AND MENTAL HEALTH NURSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Accessible Summary What is known on the subject The mental health needs of individuals are increasing following the COVID-19 pandemic, with a need to focus on the education of nurses to be equipped to respond. Stigma around mental health still exists for nursing students, with the implementation of mental health education by an individual with lived experience having a known positive effect on stigmatizing attitudes.Research on consumer involvement in nursing education identifies that the consumer role is often varied and casual, with no existing review on the consumer experience.What the paper adds to existing knowledge The study emphasizes the importance of consumer involvement in nursing education. Alongside the literature focussing on the student benefits, this review highlights both the benefits of being an educator, and the challenges of being an educator from the consumer's perspective. Implications for practice The knowledge around the consumer perspective mapped in this review has the potential to impact and transform education protocols for consumer involvement in education. This can maximize on the meaningful contribution that lived experience has within mental health nursing education. This review enforces the need for an awareness of the challenges consumers face in their role as an educator, and highlights the need for further understanding of how to overcome these challenges. There is also an opportunity to capitalize on the benefits identified by consumers in their role within nursing education and sharing their lived experience. IntroductionWhile the mental health needs of populations are increasing, the targeted training of mental health professionals, specifically nurses, is required. Stigma surrounding mental health from nursing students exists, highlighting educational gaps. To address this, the involvement of consumers in undergraduate education has resulted in a positive effect on the stigmatizing attitudes of nursing students. There is still a limited understanding, however, of the consumers experience in this process. AimTo explore the experiences of individuals living with mental illness in educating nursing students. MethodsThe Joanna Brigg's Institute's (JBI) methodology for scoping reviews was used to search CINAHL, Medline, PsychInfo, Web of Science and Scopus including grey literature. The eligibility criteria for participants included individuals (a) diagnosed with a mental illness; (b) over 18 years of age; and (c) who participated in the educating of nursing students surrounding mental health in any context. Articles were only considered that were in the English language, and no time constraint was enforced during the search strategy for article selection. The search yielded 2640 results, of which 26 articles were included. ResultsResults found two prominent categories, including both benefits and challenges of being the educator from the consumer perspective. The benefits included: (a) the person behind the diagnosis; (b) reciprocal relationships; (c) positive effects on well-being; (d) unique contribution; and (e) purpose in storytelling. Challenges identified included: (a) vulnerability; (b) voyeuristic; (c) lack of preparation; (d) negative effects on well-being; (e) support; (f) not a real consumer; (g) variation of involvement; and (h) acknowledging consumer perspective.DiscussionAs consumer-led education for mental health nursing curriculum becomes mandated, amplifying the voice of the consumer in nursing education is crucial. While the benefits and challenges voiced by consumers in their involvement in mental health nursing education have been outlined here, further knowledge focussed on the consumer's experience as an educator outside the classroom setting, and in clinical practicum, alongside consumer involvement in specialized mental health education sessions, could aid in transforming consumer involvement. Implications for practiceThis review offers an incentive for nurse educators to capitalize on the benefits of educating for consumers to promote a meaningful contribution, while also practicing with an awareness of voiced challenges.

TI  - The Hodgepodge Reality: A Qualitative Systematic Review of the Challenges and Barriers in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Care Systems
T2  - ADOLESCENT RESEARCH REVIEW
M3  - Review
AB  - The literature to date has documented the presence of challenges and barriers in mental health systems and services for children and adolescents worldwide. However, studies addressing this reality often do so in a fragmented, residual, incomplete, or generalized way, therefore hindering a comprehensive understanding of this complex phenomenon. The aim of this qualitative systematic review is to analyze the barriers and challenges affecting global mental health care for children and adolescents. Searches were made in the Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed databases between 2018 and 2022 using terms connected with mental health, childhood, adolescence, and health systems. The search resulted in the extraction of 9075 articles, of which 51 were considered eligible for inclusion and complied with quality indicators. A number of closely related structural, financial, attitudinal, and treatment barriers that limited the quality of life and well-being of children and adolescents with mental health needs were found. These barriers included inadequate public policies, operational deficiencies, insufficient insurance coverage, privatization of services, stigma, lack of mental health literacy, lack of training, overburdened care, dehumanization of care, and lack of community and integrated resources. The analysis of these barriers displays that this treatment gap reflects the historical injustice towards mental illness and the disregard for real needs in these crucial stages, perpetuating a systematic lack of protection for the mental health of children and adolescents. The complexity of the disorders and the absence of public resources have resulted in a hodgepodge of mental health services for children and adolescents that fails to provide the continuing specialist health care they need.

TI  - Experiences of pathways to mental health services for young people and their carers: a qualitative meta-synthesis review
T2  - SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY AND PSYCHIATRIC EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Worldwide, growing concern with young people's mental health is spurring service reform efforts. Such reform requires a full understanding of the experiences of young people and their carers when seeking mental health help. To generate such an understanding, we conducted a meta-synthesis of qualitative literature on the perspectives of youths and their carers on navigating mental health systems. Five electronic databases were searched (Medline, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, HealthSTAR). Studies were included if they explored the experiences of pathways to mental health services of persons aged 11-30 years and/or their carers; were published in English or French; and used qualitative methodology. Quality appraisal was conducted using the CASP tool. The synthesis of 31 included studies yielded three themes-initiating contact with mental health services; characteristics of services' response; and youths' and carers' appraisal of services. Themes about initiating contact included mental health literacy, structural barriers, and social support. Service response-related themes included complex pathways, waitlists, eligibility, and fragmented care. In terms of service appraisal, positive encounters featured providers who were accessible and perceived as caring. Negative appraisals resulted from feeling misunderstood and excluded and being ill-informed about treatment. Across diagnoses and settings, youths and carers had difficult experiences accessing mental healthcare. While individual, social, and healthcare factors shaping pathways to care varied, systemic complexities were a common inhibitor. This synthesis informs recommendations for improving mental health services and youths' pathways to them. It underlines the need for grounding reform in youths' and carers' perspectives and needs.

TI  - Involving young people with lived experience in advancing mental health science: an exploratory qualitative study from Pakistan and India
T2  - BMC PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundMeaningful involvement of young People with Lived Experience (PWLE) in co-designing youth mental health interventions has been much emphasized globally. However, there is a scarcity of evidence on involving PWLE of mental health problems in designing, implementing and evaluating mental health interventions, especially in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). The aim of the current study was to understand the perspectives of young PWLE from two South Asian countries, Pakistan and India, regarding "Active Ingredients" (AIs) for youth mental health (i.e., components or processes of mental health intervention(s) that make a difference to mental health outcomes), as part of the Wellcome Trust AI Commission.MethodsFor this exploratory qualitative study, we conducted 30 qualitative interviews via Zoom with young PWLE from Pakistan (n = 19, 14 females and 5 males) and India (n = 11, 8 females and 3 males) to explore their views about different AIs for youth anxiety and depression in South Asia. The qualitative data was analysed using a thematic analysis approach that moved through the phases of familiarization, generation of codes, searching, identification and review of themes and selection of illustrative quotes.ResultsThe results show that family and religion are integral to promoting positive youth mental health in the South Asian context. The AIs perceived to be most relevant for Pakistani and Indian young people were (i) improving social relationships; (ii) managing emotions; and (iii) relaxation techniques. Participants highlighted the need to explore the role of family support, personal space, spirituality/religion, schools, mental health literacy and stigma as potential AIs of mental health for young people in South Asia. The need for ease of access to mental health support and minimizing barriers to engagement with mental health services were highlighted as important contextual factors. Our findings highlight the need for culturally responsive youth mental health strategies that incorporate their preferred intervention components and address key challenges including stigma faced by South Asian youth.ConclusionsThe current study highlights specific intervention components and contextual considerations that are important to Indian and Pakistani young PWLE when designing and delivering mental health interventions. Our findings underscore the need to work with young PWLE and consider their context, culture, and resources when developing or evaluating mental health interventions. Given our sample likely represents a relatively advantaged group, future studies can use targeted sampling strategies to capture perspectives of young people from lower socio-economic strata.

TI  - Barriers and facilitators associated with the use of mental health services among immigrant students in high-income countries: A systematic scoping review
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundImmigrant students face various challenges in high-income countries that can contribute to the decline of their mental well-being upon arrival in their host country. Despite the growing population of these students in several high-income countries, there is inadequate attention given to their mental health needs and their access to mental health services. Thus, this systematic scoping review aimed to identify gaps in existing research relating to the barriers and facilitators associated with access to and use of mental health services in high-income countries. MethodsFollowing the PRISMA-ScR checklist as guidance we systematically searched Ovid Medline, APA PsycInfo, Education Source, CINAHL, Web of Science databases for peer reviewed articles related to barriers and facilitators of mental health service use among immigrant students. We conducted a narrative evidence synthesis to highlight barriers and facilitators to the use of mental health services. ResultsOut of the 2407 articles initially found, 47 studies met the inclusion criteria and were considered for this review. The increasing attention towards the mental health concerns of immigrant students and their access to mental health services is evident. However, various barriers like stigma, insufficient knowledge, or adherence to traditional gender roles (such as masculinity) hinder their utilization of these services. On the other hand, factors such as being a woman, having a strong sense of cultural adaptation, or possessing adequate mental health literacy serve as facilitators for accessing mental health services. ConclusionThese students have unique experiences, and their needs are often unmet. To improve their mental health and use of mental health services, it is important to consider the barriers they face and their unique experience in their specific life context and to develop tailored prevention and intervention programs.

TI  - A multicomponent digital intervention to promote help-seeking for mental health problems and suicide in sexual and gender diverse young adults: A randomized controlled trial
T2  - PLOS MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background LGBTQ+ community's higher susceptibility to worse mental health outcomes and more help-seeking barriers compared to the cis-heterosexual population. Despite the LGBTQ+ population facing higher mental health risks, there has been a dearth of research focusing on developing tailored interventions targeting them. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of a digital multicomponent intervention in promoting help-seeking for mental health issues in LGBTQ+ young adults.Methods and findings We recruited LGBTQ+ young adults aged between 18 and 29 who scored moderate or above on at least 1 dimension of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21 and did not have help-seeking experiences in the past 12 months. Participants (n = 144) were stratified by gender assigned at birth (male/female) and randomly allocated (1:1 ratio) to the intervention or active control parallel condition by generating a random number table, so they were blinded to the intervention condition. All participants received online psychoeducational videos, online facilitator-led group discussions, and electronic brochures in December 2021 and January 2022, with the final follow-up in April 2022. The contents of the video, discussion, and brochure are help-seeking for the intervention group and general mental health knowledge for the control group. The primary outcomes were help-seeking intentions for emotional problems and suicidal ideation and attitudes toward seeking help from mental health professionals at the 1-month follow-up. The analysis was performed by including all participants based on their randomized group regardless of adherence to the protocol. A linear mixed model (LMM) was used for analysis. All models were adjusted for baseline scores. Chinese Clinical Trial Registry: ChiCTR2100053248.A total of 137 (95.1%) participants completed a 3-month follow-up, and 4 participants from the intervention condition and 3 from the control condition did not complete the final survey. Compared with the control group (n = 72), a significant improvement was found in help-seeking intentions for suicidal ideation in the intervention group (n = 70) at post-discussion (mean difference = 0.22, 95% CI [0.09, 0.36], p = 0.005), 1-month (mean difference = 0.19, 95% CI [0.06, 0.33], p = 0.018), and 3-month follow-ups (mean difference = 0.25, 95% CI [0.11, 0.38], p = 0.001). There was also a significant improvement in the intervention condition on the help-seeking intention for emotional problems at 1-month (mean difference = 0.17, 95% CI [0.05, 0.28], p = 0.013) and 3-month follow-ups (mean difference = 0.16, 95% CI [0.04, 0.27], p = 0.022) compared with the control group. Participants' depression and anxiety literacy and help-seeking encouragement related knowledge in intervention conditions showed significant improvements. There were no significant improvements in actual help-seeking behaviors, self-stigma toward seeking professional assistance, depression, and anxiety symptoms. No adverse events or side effects were observed. However, the follow-up time point was limited to 3 months which might not be long enough for drastic mindset and behavioral changes in help-seeking to occur.Conclusions The current intervention was an effective approach in promoting help-seeking intentions, mental health literacy, and help-seeking encouragement-related knowledge. Its brief yet integrated intervention format could also be utilized in treating other imminent concerns confronted by LGBTQ+ young adults.

TI  - An Exploratory Case Study of the Types of Resources Black Boys Use to Support Their Mental Health
T2  - HEALTHCARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Black adolescent boys experience mental health challenges because of their exposure to a greater frequency and severity of psychosocial stressors. This study used a sample of Black boys at a high school in southeastern Michigan as a case study to understand the types of resources Black boys might use to support their mental health. After conducting a rigorous analysis of the study data using a rapid and an accelerated data reduction technique, four themes helped us answer the question: What kinds of mental health support resources are Black boys using? Four themes emerged from our analysis: online resources, community and trusted individuals, self-reliance, and additional needs. This case study is a springboard for further work to tailor a mental health education and support intervention, such as the YBMen Project, for Black boys and for building additional support amid the multiple crises occurring that impact their mental health and safety. Findings have implications for future research, practice, and policy to improve the mental health of Black boys in high school.

TI  - Virtual Standardized Patients for Mental Health Education
T2  - CURRENT PSYCHIATRY REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of Review The training of psychiatrists and other mental health professionals requires education on a range of interpersonal, communication, and psychotherapy techniques. Classroom and workshop training must be augmented by experiential learning with feedback for skill implementation with fidelity. Virtual standardized patients (VSPs) are computerized conversational agents that can support experiential learning through standardized, consequence-free training environments at reduced costs. Recent Findings Research on mental health VSPs is rife with feasibility and acceptability pilot studies across various training populations and settings. Users have generally reported positive reactions to training with VSPs, though frustrations with some VSP speech recognition or VSP response relevance has been reported. Several studies have demonstrated a promising transfer of clinical skills from VSP training to human standardized patients and randomized trials supporting improved skill relative to reading or academic study are encouraging. As technology improves and natural language processing and accurate computer response generation for broad ranging conversational topics emerges, the field would benefit from research on the characteristics of effective VSPs for a range of purposes and trainee populations. Well-designed randomized evaluations of VSPs relative to best practices in education are needed, particularly regarding the impact of VSPs on clinical practice among actual patients.

TI  - Examining the Efficacy of Large Language Models for Mitigating Depression and Anxiety Among Chinese Students: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
T2  - Computers, informatics, nursing : CIN
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Randomized Controlled Trial
AB  - Secondary school students undergo significant psychological and physiological changes during adolescence, increasing their vulnerability to mental health issues. However, existing mental health services are inadequate to address the growing demand. To bridge this gap, we developed WarmGPT, a conversational mental health service robot utilizing a large language model integrated with cognitive- behavioral therapy, aimed at supporting secondary school students. In this study, 40 students from a Chinese secondary school were randomly assigned to an experimental group or a control group. The experimental group received 2 weeks of counseling through WarmGPT, whereas the control group viewed mental health education videos. Emotional states were evaluated before and after the intervention using scales measuring depression, anxiety, and positive and negative affect. Results indicated that the large language model-based WarmGPT significantly reduced depression, anxiety, and negative emotions and increased positive emotions among the students, outperforming the control group. These findings suggest that large language model-based conversational agents such as WarmGPT are effective in alleviating negative emotions and enhancing overall mental health in secondary school students, offering a promising new approach for mental health interventions.

TI  - The use of vignettes in mental health: Translation and cross-cultural adaptation of a social anxiety vignette in adolescents
T2  - REVISTA PORTUGUESA DE INVESTIGACAO COMPORTAMENTAL E SOCIAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To present the translation and cross-cultural adaptation of a social anxiety vignette in adolescents into European Portuguese and the consequent integration in the Mental Health Literacy Assessment Questionnaire - QuALiSMental. Method: A methodological study of translation and cross-cultural adaptation of a social anxiety vignette in adolescents into European Portuguese was carried out, according to the stages: 1) translation; 2) synthesis of translations; 3) back-translation; 4) synthesis of back-translations; 5) panel of experts with eight professionals from different areas of health; 5) cognitive debriefing integrating six adolescents with an average age of 14.33 years (SD = 0.52); 6) review and final report. Throughout this process, we have taken into account the ethical considerations. Results: A vignette of social anxiety was obtained in the teenagers "Joao" and "Joana" in European Portuguese. We highlight the results related to the stages: the panel of experts and cognitive debriefing. Consensus criteria were obtained among experts for semantic and idiomatic equivalence, experiential and cultural equivalence, and conceptual equivalence. In the cognitive debriefing, a 100% agreement was found regarding the clarity of the vignette's content in the European Portuguese. Conclusions: This vignette can be used in clinical practice at different levels of care, education/training, and research. Integrated with QuALiSMental allows the assessment of mental health literacy on anxiety in adolescents in different contexts and/or assessments of psychoeducational interventions' effectiveness in this area.

TI  - Moulding student mental health in Singapore's Character and Citizenship Education: projected pedagogic identities
T2  - PEDAGOGY CULTURE AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines the official pedagogic discourse communicating the explicit inclusion of Mental Health (MH) education in Singapore's revised 2021 Character and Citizenship (CCE2021) curriculum within Singapore's state-driven educational context of decentralised centralism. By adapting Basil Bernstein's theoretical work on pedagogic discourse - using William Tyler's typology of Bernstein's 'Pedagogic Codes' and 'Official Pedagogic Identities' - our findings reveal how MH in CCE2021 projects different, simultaneous student identities. These include retrospective identities of students as resilient, community-minded citizens; prospective identities of students as vulnerable cyber users requiring explicit guidance for their future-readiness; de-centred therapeutic identities of students as reflective, self-actualising students requiring psychological safety; and de-centred market identities of students as trained advocates and community first responders. Together, they generate a tension where therapeutic identities are positioned as prerequisite to the other identities, subsuming individual well-being within community well-being, and conflating the intrinsic good of personal resilience with instrumental notions of future-readiness. This expresses a paradox where state-student social relations are both transformed and continued, as concerns of student confidentiality and efficacy of help-seeking efforts persist. Overall, we contend the educational reform of MH in CCE2021 accommodates rather than reconciles progressive concerns of youth mental health with neoliberal state imperatives.

TI  - Becoming an Expert by Experience: Benefits and Challenges of Educating Mental Health Nursing Students
T2  - ISSUES IN MENTAL HEALTH NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Expert by Experience involvement in mental health nursing education is increasing in popularity as a teaching technique. The emerging literature attests to its benefits in enriching the educational experience for students. Much less attention has been devoted to the experience from the perspective of the Experts themselves. To address this gap and ensure this important perspective is captured and considered, the aim of this paper is to present the perceptions and experiences of Experts by Experience in delivering an educational module to mental health nursing students. A qualitative exploratory approach was adopted, involving in-depth individual interviews with Experts by Experience who delivered a learning module to nursing students in Australia and Europe. Data were analysed thematically. Analysis produced two overarching themes: Empowerment, and Challenges. Challenges included six sub-themes: Being constructive, not just critical; Time to unpack and reflect; Need for co-production and support from nursing academics; Emotional and practical support; maintaining personal boundaries; and adapting to the audience. These findings make a significant contribution to a broader understanding of Expert by Experience involvement in mental health education. The use of standards to maintain integrity and avoid tokenism is recommended.

TI  - Analysis of Stigma in Relation to Behaviour and Attitudes towards Mental Health as Influenced by Social Desirability in Nursing Students
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The training undergraduate nursing students receive, both in terms of theoretical input and clinical practice, may help to instil a less stigmatising perception of mental health. To analyse the perceived evolution of attitudes and expected behaviours, a longitudinal repeated measures study was conducted in a population of student nurses during their undergraduate mental health education. The Mental Illness: Clinicians' Attitudes Scale, a Scale for measuring attitudes to the mentally ill among future Health workers, and the Reported and Intended Behaviour Scale were completed. A mixed linear model was used to assess the effect of each factor in the questionnaires before and after the various stages of the students' training in mental health. The overall effect of each factor was assessed by testing the interaction between factor and group, both with and without adjustment with the Social Desirability Scale. The results showed that the clinical practice stage, due to the proximity to care for people with mental health problems, improves attitudes and behaviours towards mental health in students who have not had mental health problems, and also in younger students. In conclusion, integrated, holistic training during the period of clinical practice was associated with positive changes in the attitudes and intended behaviour.

TI  - Characteristics in Initial Sandplay of Optimal and Non-optimal Family Functioning Among High School Students
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveThe purpose of this study is to explore the characteristics of the initial sandplay of high school students with poor family function, by studying the initial sandplay of high school students with different levels of family function, so as to provide the basics for the psychological assessment and intervention of high school students. SignificanceTo provide data support for high school students' mental health education and sandplay therapy, and to apply sandplay as an intervention method to play a healing role in high school mental health work. MethodsHigh school students (N = 345) were divided into 11 groups and participated in a sandplay experiment for 8 weeks from February to March 2021. Each group completed the Chinese version of the Epstein et al. Family Assessment Device. Samples with scores of one standard deviation below and above the sample mean were placed in the low family functioning group (n = 30; 15 girls) or high family functioning group (n = 30; 15 girls), respectively. The initial sandplay was evaluated on multiple dimensions using an established coding system. ResultsSamples with low family functioning used fewer animal figurines in their sandplay (t = 2.176, p < 0.05); had more family scenes (chi(2) = 4.356, p < 0.05); fewer rural scenes (chi(2) = 4.344, p < 0.05); and fewer healing themes (t = -2.336, p < 0.05). In particular, there were fewer examples of connected healing themes (chi(2) = 7.500, p < 0.05); in-depth healing themes (chi(2) = 5.455, p < 0.05); and more hindered trauma themes (chi(2) = 4.812, p < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis was conducted using the sandplay characteristics as predictors of group membership. Using forward stepwise selection, themes of hindered trauma (B = -2.030) and connected healing (B=1.765) were shown to be significant predictors of group membership (F = 17.784, P < 0.01, Delta R-2 = 0.214). ConclusionStudents who reported high and low family functioning showed significant differences in their sandplay characteristics. We propose sandplay characteristics can help identify low family functioning of adolescents during psychological evaluations.

TI  - Online Mental Health Animations for Young People: Qualitative Empirical Thematic Analysis and Knowledge Transfer
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Mental ill-health is one of the most significant health and social issues affecting young people globally. To address the mental health crisis, a number of cross-sectoral research and action priorities have been identified. These include improving mental health literacy, translating research findings into accessible public health outputs, and the use of digital technologies. There are, however, few examples of public health-oriented knowledge transfer activities involving collaborations between researchers, the Arts, and online platforms in the field of youth mental health.Objective: The primary aim of this project was to translate qualitative research findings into a series of online public mental health animations targeting young people between the ages of 16 and 25 years. A further aim was to track online social media engagement and viewing data for the animations for a period of 12 months.Methods: Qualitative data were collected from a sample of 17 youth in Ireland, aged 18-21 years, as part of the longitudinal population-based Adolescent Brain Development study. Interviews explored the life histories and the emotional and mental health of participants. The narrative analysis revealed 5 thematic findings relating to young people's emotional and mental health. Through a collaboration between research, the Arts, and the online sector, the empirical thematic findings were translated into 5 public health animations. The animations were hosted and promoted on 3 social media platforms of the Irish youth health website called SpunOut. Viewing data, collected over a 12-month period, were analyzed to determine the reach of the animations.Results: Narrative thematic analysis identified anxiety, depression, feeling different, loneliness, and being bullied as common experiences for young people. These thematic findings formed the basis of the animations. During the 12 months following the launch of the animations, they were viewed 15,848 times. A majority of views occurred during the period of the social media ad campaign at a cost of (sic)0.035 (approximately US $0.042) per view. Animations on feeling different and being bullied accounted for the majority of views.Conclusions: This project demonstrates that online animations provide an accessible means of translating empirical research findings into meaningful public health outputs. They offer a cost-effective way to provide targeted online information about mental health, coping, and help-seeking to young people. Cross-sectoral collaboration is required to leverage the knowledge and expertise required to maximize the quality and potential reach of any knowledge transfer activities. A high level of engagement is possible by targeting non-help-seeking young people on their native social media platforms. Paid promotion is, therefore, an important consideration when budgeting for online knowledge translation and dissemination activities in health research.

TI  - The experiences of family resilience from the view of the adult children of parents with bipolar disorder in Chinese society
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims This study explored how adult children perceived family resilience, barriers to develop family resilience and how cultural values influence their experience of parents with bipolar disorder in Chinese society. Design A qualitative design with an interpretive phenomenological analysis of data was employed. Methods Twenty adults who had lived with parents with bipolar disorder during childhood were recruited from the acute psychiatric ward when their parents were admitted to the hospital. They described their experiences of perceived family resilience and barriers to resilience (October 2013-September 2015). Semi-structured interviews were conducted in the hospital meeting room or at a convenient location. Findings Six themes were identified in family resilience: ill parents try to be good parents, parents' personal strengths, parents' positive attitudes towards mental illness, flexibility of family role, cohesive relationships between family members, and families' social connections. Three themes were identified in the barriers to develop family resilience: poor parenting/family function, conflict between parents and poor mental health literacy. Conclusion Children's views of family resilience could transform their suffering from lived experiences with a mentally ill parent to a positive growth experience. Family resilience includes well and ill parents' efforts and social network's help to maintain family function. However, the conflicts between well and ill parents and poor family function result in a traumatic growth experience. Impact To enhance a positive growth experience, family resilience programs for a parent with bipolar disorder aiming to cultivate both the ill and well parents' inner strength and their competence of parenting skills with connecting their social network to maintain family function is needed. Moreover, early stress-reduction intervention needs to be developed for children who did not experience family resilience.

TI  - Mental health needs and accessing specialised healthcare in Mexican children with mental disorders: gender- and diagnosis-dependent differences
T2  - BJPSYCH OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundAccess describes factors that influence the initial contact or use of services, emphasising both the characteristics of patients and the health resources that influence the use of health services.AimsTo compare Mexican boys and girls with mental disorders, with respect to primary diagnosis, symptom onset, and seeking and accessing specialised mental health services (SMHS).MethodLongitudinal data were collected from primary caregiver-reported assessments of 397 child-caretaker dyads (child mean age 12.17 years, range 5-18 years, 63% male) that were obtained in two psychiatric hospitals specialising in child mental healthcare. Student t-tests and chi 2-tests were applied to compare boys and girls regarding their diagnosis and variables associated with the seeking of and access to SMHS.ResultsHyperkinetic disorder was the most prevalent diagnosis in boys, whereas depressive disorder and anxiety disorder were most prevalent in girls. The mean age at symptom onset for boys was 7 years, compared with 10 years for girls. Hyperkinetic disorder had the earliest symptom onset (mean 5.9 years), followed by depressive disorder (mean 9.8 years) and anxiety disorder (mean 12 years). Delayed access to SMHS was associated with initially seeking care from a psychologist, whereas quicker access was associated with affiliation with the (now defunct) Popular Insurance, a programme that served low-income and uninsured individuals.ConclusionsProgrammes aimed at children's mental health education and early intervention should consider gender- and diagnosis-related differences in symptom onset and trajectory. Access to SMHS might be improved by rapid identification by parents, educators, primary-care physicians and psychologists.

TI  - A critical consideration of the relationship between professional and public understandings of Family Support: Towards greater public awareness and discursive coherence in concept and delivery
T2  - CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this article is to consider critically the relationship between professional and public understandings of Family Support. It is based on research comprising baseline and follow-up population surveys carried out with 1000 respondents in each phase to establish levels of public awareness of the Parenting, Prevention and Family Support services provided by the Child and Family Agency in the Republic of Ireland (McGregor & Nic Gabhainn, 2016; McGregor & Nic Gabhainn, 2018). In the article, we draw on three main conceptual areas: Family Support, Public Awareness and Help-seeking. The findings either reflect some of the conceptual ambiguity in the academic field or illustrate major gaps between the theoretical and the actual. Thus, we found that, adults rely on informal supports in dealing with challenges and issues they face and that universal services are the next line of support, if informal sources are not enough, both of which reflect the literature. However, the findings show that the public do not see Family Support in terms of resource centers, specialist parenting programmes or other formal services. Rather, Family Support is more commonly associated with Child Protection. The findings and our analyses challenge us to provide better accounts of what Family Support is in order to ensure service-use, in particular in the context of preventing and / or intervening early to address the issues families face. Such accounts require more and better engagement with children, young people, parents and wider family members, and reflection by academics and researchers on the provenance of our own constructions of Family Support.

TI  - A systematic review of sport-based adolescent mental health awareness programmes
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Adolescent mental illness is of increasing concern, with a high prevalence in many parts of the world. Early engagement, detection and receiving support are warranted to reduce the severity of symptoms. Increasing mental health literacy (MHL) through sport to adolescents is one way of engaging young people and signposting them to services. The aim of this systematic review was to identify the effect of interventions, risk of bias, and theoretical application in sport-based adolescent mental health awareness programmes.Methods: Six electronic databases (MEDLINE Ovid, PsycINFO, Scopus, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, Cochrane) were searched from 2012 to September 2022 (updated January 2024). Inclusion criteria stated the sample had to include adolescents aged 11-17 years, include mental health outcomes, and a sport component.Results: Six studies met the inclusion criteria. Sample size ranged from nine to 816 participants. Four distinct sport-based programmes were evaluated, with three interventions applying a psychological behaviour change theory. The results of the interventions indicated positive effects on several indices of MHL, such as increased knowledge of mental health, depression and anxiety literacy and the recognition of disorders, increased resilience and intentions to provide help. It was found that addressing stigma remains a challenge. The interventions produced the most significant effects for those who scored lower at baseline measures and the younger cohorts.Conclusions: Sport is useful for the engagement and dissemination of mental health awareness information to adolescents. Given the limited number of psychological theory informed interventions, there is a need for further interventions that explicitly adopt behaviour change theories and improve the quality of research design for these interventions. The findings from this review will be of interest to health promotion and public health practitioners and those designing mental health awareness programmes for adolescents.Systematic review registration PROSPERO CRD42022312260

TI  - Dressing the wound in education: A reading of Kore-eda's Shoplifters
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper addresses the question of mental health, in particular the manner in which it finds its way into education. Increased attention to mental health in education should be welcomed, but often the focus is on 'problem-solving', which in turn confines the 'solution' within the spectrum of preventive and corrective intervention. Often it is the term 'mental health' itself that leads us to think of it, by analogy to physical health, as a kind of goal to be achieved, a recovery and recuperation-that is, something to be effectively aided and fixed. But I suggest that if there is any way that education can attend to children's mental health, it is rather by holding itself back from problem-solving. Then, other than considering the 'problem' as an object of inquiry or introspection, attention can be turned towards the contextuality of human experience and what I shall call its fundamentally wounded condition. Hence, a shifting in the conception of the problem. I take the film Shoplifters as a starting point-that is, as a site where we can attend to the particularities of reality and the specificities of experience. Towards the end, it will become clearer how film can direct us to an alternative way to attend to mental health in education.

T2  - PSYCHIATRIA I PSYCHOLOGIA KLINICZNA-JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY AND CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This review synthesises current research on the prevalence and determinants of depressive and anxiety symptoms among medical students. It highlights significant mental health challenges faced by this group, emphasising the influence of various factors such as academic pressures, personality traits, and reluctance to seek professional help. The analysis also delves into the roles of gender and geographical variation, revealing how these factors contribute to differing rates of mental health issues among medical students globally. The findings reveal a concerning prevalence of depression and anxiety, with variation observed across different regions and genders, indicating the influence of cultural and societal norms on mental health. This review underscores the urgent need for enhanced mental health support and intervention strategies within medical education systems. The importance of incorporating psychological support programmes and mental health education into curricula is highlighted. By addressing these issues, there is a potential to significantly improve the well-being and academic success of medical students, ultimately contributing to their overall mental health and resilience in their future professional lives. The paper advocates for a multifaceted approach in tackling these challenges, suggesting that medical institutions should not only focus on academic excellence but also prioritise the mental health of their students, ensuring a more supportive and nurturing educational environment.

TI  - Black Boys' Perceptions of Depression and Mental Health: Findings from the YBMen Project
T2  - SOCIAL PROBLEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite growing research dedicated to investigating the mental health of Black boys, few directly examine experiences with their perceptions and understanding of mental health conditions such as depression. This study uses data from a social media-based intervention for Black males, the Young Black Men, Masculinities, and Mental Health project. In a focus group with 8th-grade Black boys, facilitators asked open-ended questions about perceptions of mental health and depression, views of manhood, and experiences with social support. Findings revealed this group of Black boys - while well versed in many of the causes, symptoms, and treatments for mental health challenges and depression - preferred to address mental health needs on their own and through informal familial support. It also revealed the boys wrestled with the complex ways in which their racial identity would affect their experiences with mental health. The findings speak to the importance of mental health education for Black boys and the need for further research incorporating Black boys' voices in their perceptions, experiences, and understandings of mental health. Finally, the study connects Black boys' perspectives with many of the perspectives of their racially diverse peers.

TI  - "Improved access, delayed accreditation, low recognition": perspectives of mental health educators, preceptors and students on the Kintampo Project in Ghana
T2  - JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH TRAINING EDUCATION AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this study explores the perspective of key informants (educators, preceptors and former students) of the Kintampo Project, on the perceived effectiveness, gains and challenges in delivering this large-scale training innovation in Ghana. The problem of mental health care neglect in Ghana is gradually improving. The Kintampo Project which trained mental health workers in Ghana has played a critical role in increasing access to mental health care. Design/methodology/approachThis qualitative study explored participants' perspectives on the Kintampo Project in three broad areas: perceived effectiveness, gains and challenges. In all, 17 interviews were conducted with former students, preceptors and educators from the project. The interviews were digitally audio-recorded, transcribed, coded and analysed using deductive and thematic methods. FindingsThe participants perceived the project to have been successful in increasing the number of mental health workers in Ghana. The project provided a route for career progression for those involved. However, the Kintampo Project faced accreditation issues, low recognition, improper integration and remuneration of trained staff in the Ghana Health Service. This study points to the fact that the sustainability of mental health training in Ghana can be obstructed, because of this career path being less attractive. Further research is needed to explore how best to achieve sustainability of similar mental health innovations. Originality/valueThis paper shares the views of participants in the Kintampo Project.

TI  - " I don't care about my mental health because I have a physical disability": A qualitative study on the mental healthcare-seeking behaviours of people with disabilities in Bangladesh
T2  - ACTA PSYCHOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In Bangladesh, people living with disabilities are one of the most vulnerable groups, as they receive little or no assistance. They face numerous challenges regarding financial, social, and access to basic education and healthcare, which contribute to experiences of distress and mental health issues. However, there is limited research on the mental health needs of people with disabilities and the accessibility of mental health services in Bangladesh. This qualitative study addresses this gap by examining the mental healthcare-seeking behaviours of people with disabilities and challenges in care-seeking pathways and recommendations for devising an inclusive system in existing mental health services through key informant interviews and focus group discussions with 55 participants from four stakeholder groups. Findings highlight that limited mental health, literacy, stigma, and financial and logistical challenges, such as inaccessible transportation and distant facilities, hinder access to care. System-level barriers, including a lack of specialists and inadequate community-based services, further exacerbate the issue. Stakeholders recommended strengthening social support systems by providing disability identity cards, allowances, and access to inclusive education and employment opportunities. They also emphasized the need for awareness campaigns, better transportation options, and training for healthcare workers. Policymakers are urged to design culturally relevant needs-based interventions to improve mental healthcare pathways for people with disabilities while promoting multisectoral collaboration.

TI  - Contemplating Help-Seeking in Perinatal Psychological Distress-A Meta-Ethnography
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Perinatal psychological distress (PPD) may cause delays in help-seeking in the perinatal period, which is crucial for families with small children. Help-seeking theories focus on rational processes of behavior wherein 'help-seeking' is viewed as a decision-making process, in which action is preceded by recognizing a problem. We identified the phase prior to actual help-seeking actions as a life situation and a phenomenon through which to gain a deeper understanding from women's own perspectives. The aim of this study was to integrate and synthesize knowledge of women's experiences of contemplating seeking help for PPD. We chose interpretative meta-ethnography by Noblit and Hare (1988) and implemented eMERGe guidelines in reporting. The search was performed systematically, and the 14 included studies were evaluated with Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist (CASP). We identified seven themes and a metaphor in a lines-of-argument synthesis, showing that contemplating help-seeking is a multidimensional phenomenon. We did not observe a straightforward and linear process (as previous research suggests) but instead a complex process of contemplating help-seeking. A clinical implication is that service providers should work with outreach and develop their tools to connect with mothers with PPD. Another suggestion is to improve training in mental health literacy prior to or during pregnancy.

TI  - The use of games in the classroom to promote mental health knowledge and healthy attitudes in adolescents: a systematic review
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Many adolescents face significant mental health challenges, including anxiety, depression, and substance-related and addictive disorders, with a growing need for school-based preventive strategies. Traditional classroom interventions often struggle to engage adolescents, prompting the exploration of game-based approaches to improve mental health knowledge and foster healthier attitudes. Objective: This systematic review evaluates the effectiveness of game-based interventions implemented in classroom settings to enhance mental health knowledge and promote positive attitudes among adolescents. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted across Medline, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and SCOPUS, yielding 1,152 articles. After screening, 17 studies were included, most using cluster randomized controlled trial designs. These interventions addressed topics of mental health such as substance-related and addictive disorders, anxiety, and depression, employing playful activities like video games, virtual reality simulations, quizzes, and collaborative tasks. Results: The interventions showed positive effects on knowledge acquisition and attitude change, with high satisfaction reported by participants. Those programs targeting alcohol and tobacco use were particularly effective in improving knowledge and attitudes. However, the quality of evidence varied, and long-term effects were not widely assessed due to a lack of follow-up in most studies. Some interventions had a limited impact on self-efficacy and behavior change. Conclusions: Game-based classroom interventions show promise in promoting mental health literacy and healthier attitudes among adolescents. While short-term outcomes are encouraging, more rigorous studies with extended follow-up periods are necessary to understand their long-term effectiveness. Future interventions should focus on practical skill development and personalization to maximize impact.

TI  - The relationship between harsh parenting and adolescent depression
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Guided by Beck's cognitive model of depression, this study comprehensively explores the mechanisms linking harsh parenting, rumination, and victimization to the development of adolescent depression. A total of 5047 adolescents were assessed using the Harsh Parenting Scale, Rumination Scale, Olweus Bullying/Victimization Questionnaire, and Beck Depression Inventory. The results indicated that harsh parenting positively influences adolescent depression. Moreover, rumination emerged as an important mediator between harsh parenting and adolescent depression, similar to victimization. Additionally, we found that both rumination and victimization act as chain mediators in the relationship between harsh parenting and adolescent depression. These findings demonstrate that harsh parenting impacts adolescent depression mediated by rumination and victimization. By shedding light on these mechanisms, this study improves our comprehension of how harsh parenting influences adolescent depression and offers valuable insights for designing interventions to alleviate depression in this population.

TI  - Increasing demand for school counselling through a lay counsellor-delivered classroom sensitisation intervention: a stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial in New Delhi, India
T2  - BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction We evaluated a classroom-based sensitisation intervention that was designed to reduce demand-side barriers affecting referrals to a school counselling programme. The sensitisation intervention was offered in the context of a host trial evaluating a low-intensity problem-solving treatment for common adolescent mental health problems.Methods We conducted a stepped-wedge, cluster randomised controlled trial with 70 classes in 6 secondary schools serving low-income communities in New Delhi, India. The classes were randomised to receive a classroom sensitisation session involving a brief video presentation and moderated group discussion, delivered by a lay counsellor over one class period (intervention condition, IC), in two steps of 4 weeks each. The control condition (CC) was whole-school sensitisation (teacher-meetings and whole-school activities such as poster displays). The primary outcome was the proportion of students referred into the host trial. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of students who met mental health caseness criteria and the proportion of self-referred adolescents.Results Between 20 August 2018 and 9 December 2018, 835 students (23.3% of all students) were referred into the host trial. The referred sample included 591 boys (70.8%), and had a mean age of 15.8 years, SD=0.06; 194 students (31.8% of 610 with complete data) met mental health caseness criteria. The proportion of students referred in each trial conditionwas significantly higher in the IC (IC=21.7%, CC=1.5%, OR=111.36, 95% CI 35.56 to 348.77, p<0.001). The proportion of self-referred participants was also higher in the IC (IC=98.1%, CC=89.1%, Pearson chi(2) (1)=16.92, p<0.001). Although the proportion of referred students meeting caseness criteria was similar in both conditions (IC=32.0% vs CC=28.1%), the proportion weighted for the total student population was substantially higher in the IC (IC=5.2%, CC=0.3%, OR=52.39, 95% CI 12.49 to 219.66, p<0.001).Conclusion A single, lay counsellor-delivered, classroom sensitisation session increased psychological help-seeking for common mental health problems among secondary school pupils from urban, low-income communities in India.

TI  - Experience with introducing peer trainers into mental health education
T2  - SOCIAL WORK EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - People who have experienced mental health problems often encounter stigmatisation, mainly by professional mental health care providers. Therefore, involvement of experts by experience in courses taught at a higher education institution that provides training for future healthcare professionals aims at destigmatising mental illnesses. Peer trainers have a lived mental health problems experience who take on the role of trainers to present the latest mental health care trends and theories and introduce recovery elements into the educational process.The data on which the article is based were gathered over a period of three years from focus groups involving 2nd year students of the bachelor's degree programme of 'Clinical Social Worker'. The results obtained clearly show the destigmatising effect of this type of teaching: what has proven to be crucial in this regard was, on the one hand, the experience of former patients, and on the other hand, a counterweight to the often-one-sided information prevalent in professional literature on mental health available in the Czech Republic. The teaching reinforced the students' ability to work in a multidisciplinary team together with a peer support worker and also undermined any prejudice they may have had towards people with mental health problems.

TI  - Co-creating mental health education with students: a qualitative case study in pharmacy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - IntroductionGiven that medication is often utilised to treat mental health conditions, pharmacists across sectors are well placed to provide enhanced care to patients beyond their knowledge of medicines. However, this requires pharmacists to be appropriately educated about mental health. This study explores the priorities of pharmacy students for learning about mental health.AimThis study aimed to explore the ideas and priorities of fourth year pharmacy students for mental health education under the following categories: (1) Content to be included. (2) What knowledge, skills and attitudes students wish to develop. (3) The teaching and learning approaches associated with developing these knowledge, skills and attitudes.MethodAn exploratory case study design was conducted in 2024 within an elective 'Education and Training' module for undergraduate pharmacy students in Ireland. Eighteen students participated in the study and engaged in three different focus groups. The study was designed with student partners who supported the facilitation of focus groups and analysis of the data. Data analysis was conducted using thematic analysis on Nvivo software with a student partner. Final themes were agreed with the wider research team.ResultsFour main themes emerged from thematic analysis of focus group transcripts: (1) the pharmacist and pharmacy as a safe space, (2) adaptable communication skills, (3) integration of physical and mental health challenges across curricula, and (4) seeking authenticity in teaching and learning approaches. Students also gave insights into what makes a contact-based learning experience worthwhile for them, and expressed a desire for integration of patient and public involvement into education in order to create a more authentic learning experience.ConclusionPharmacy students find value in authentic learning methods, and appreciate when patients and patient groups are involved in education. Additionally, they see each other as an important learning resource and value small group work. These learning methods have been integrated into our mental health module in the form of patient speakers, simulation practice, and small group work activities.

TI  - Feasibility of Text Messages for Enhancing Therapeutic Engagement Among Youth and Caregivers Initiating Outpatient Mental Health Treatment: Mixed Methods Study
T2  - JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Pathways to mental health services for youth are generally complex and often involve numerous contact points and lengthy delays. When starting treatment, there are a host of barriers that contribute to low rates of therapeutic engagement. Automated text messages offer a convenient, low-cost option for information sharing and skill building, and they can potentially activate positive behaviors in youth and caregivers prior to beginning formal therapy. To date, there is little evidence for the feasibility of initiating transdiagnostic text messages during the early stages of youth and caregiver contact with community outpatient mental health services.Objective: To develop and test the feasibility of implementing 2 novel text messaging campaigns aimed at youth clients and their caregivers during the early stages of engaging with outpatient mental health services.Methods: A multidisciplinary panel of experts developed two 12-message interventions with youth and caregivers prior to deployment. Each message included a link to an external interactive or multimedia resource to extend skill development. Enrollment of youth aged 13 to 18 years, their caregivers, or both occurred at 2 early treatment timepoints. At both time points, text messages were delivered automatically 2 times a week for 6 weeks. Analytics and survey data were collected in 2 phases, between January and March 2020 and between January and May 2021. Enrollment, willingness to persist in using the intervention, engagement, satisfaction, perceived value, and impact were measured. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize youth and caregiver outcomes.Results: A total of 41 caregivers and 36 youth consented to participate. Follow-up survey response rates were 54% (22/41) and 44%, (16/36) respectively. Over 1500 text messages were sent throughout the study. More than three-quarters (14/16, 88%) of youth reported that they learned something new and noticed a change in themselves due to receiving the texts; the same proportion (14/16, 88%) of youth said they would recommend the text messages to others. Youth ranked the first text message, related to coping with difficult emotions, as the most helpful of the series. Caregivers reported acting differently due to receiving the texts. Over two-thirds of caregivers were satisfied with the texts (16/22, 73%) and would recommend them to others (16/22, 73%). Caregivers perceived diverse levels of value in the text topics, with 9 of the 12 caregiver texts rated by at least one caregiver as the most helpful.Conclusions: Results are preliminary but show that brief, core skill-focused text messages for youth clients and caregivers in community outpatient mental health services are feasible. Both youth and caregivers reported promising knowledge and behavior change with exposure to only 12 messages over 6 weeks. A larger study with statistical power to detect changes in both perceived helpfulness and engagement is required to confirm the effectiveness of this type of transdiagnostic intervention.

TI  - Experiences of support for people who access voluntary, community and social enterprise (VCSE) organisations for self-harm: a qualitative study with stakeholder feedback
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Prevalence of self-harm In England is rising, however contact with statutory services remains relatively low. There is growing recognition of the potential role voluntary, community and social enterprise sector (VCSE) organisations have in the provision of self-harm support. We aimed to explore individuals' experiences of using these services and the barriers and facilitators to accessing support.Methods Qualitative, online interviews with 23 adults (18+) who have accessed support from VCSE organisations for self-harm in the Yorkshire and the Humber region were undertaken. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was undertaken using NVivo software.Results Participants described how a lack of service flexibility and the perception that their individual needs were not being heard often made them less likely to engage with both statutory and VCSE organisations. The complexity of care pathways made it difficult for them to access appropriate support when required, as did a lack of awareness of the types of support available. Participants described how engagement was improved by services that fostered a sense of community. The delivery of peer support played a key role in creating this sense of belonging. Education and workplace settings were also viewed as key sources of support for individuals, with a lack of mental health literacy acting as a barrier to access in these environments.Conclusions VCSE organisations can play a crucial role in the provision of support for self-harm, however, pathways into these services remain complex and links between statutory and non-statutory services need to be strengthened. The provision of peer support is viewed as a crucial component of effective support in VCSE organisations. Further supervision and training should be offered to those providing peer support to ensure that their own mental health is protected.

TI  - The impact of universal mental health screening on stigma in primary schools
T2  - CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY AND MENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundPrimary school students struggling with mental health are less likely than high school students to access mental health care, due to barriers such as mental health stigma and low mental health literacy among children and parents. The near universal reach of schools offers a potential avenue to increase access to mental health care through early identification. The potential risks of this approach also need to be understood. This study monitored the impact of universal screening for mental health symptoms on stigma and mental health outcomes for primary school students.MethodsAcross 6 primary schools, a cluster randomised controlled trial allocated schools to one of two conditions. Conditions varied based on the order and frequency of symptom and stigma questionnaires. A sample of 798 children (8 to 13 years; Mage = 10.29) completed assessments at baseline, 6-week, and 12-week follow-ups.ResultsSignificant time-by-group interaction effects were present, indicating differing changes in mental health stigma between groups. Follow-up analyses of subscales showed significant time-by-group interaction effects for concerns around self-stigma and secrecy, but not for public stigma. The frequency and presentation order of the questionnaires impacted on mental health stigma. Initially, children reporting on mental health symptoms before stigma, reported heightened stigma, but over time, those receiving more frequent presentations of the symptom check experienced an overall stigma reduction, contrasting with an increase in the comparison group.ConclusionThe frequency and presentation order of mental health symptom assessments impact children's reports of mental health stigma, underscoring the importance of screening context. Potential screening harms, such as exacerbating self-stigma and secrecy, warrant consideration. Addressing stigma-related barriers is crucial for enhancing mental health care access for children in schools.Trial registration Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12622001114730) https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=384472 Date of trial registration: 12th August 2022.ConclusionThe frequency and presentation order of mental health symptom assessments impact children's reports of mental health stigma, underscoring the importance of screening context.

TI  - Why do young men not seek help for affective mental health issues? A systematic review of perceived barriers and facilitators among adolescent boys and young men
T2  - EUROPEAN CHILD & ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Review
AB  - Men are less likely to seek help for their mental health than women, but less is known about the specific patterns of help-seeking in adolescent boys and young men. This is concerning as adolescent boys and young men have high suicide rates but a low take-up of services. It is therefore of particular importance that the access needs of this group are understood. This review sought to identify the barriers and facilitators faced by adolescent boys and young men in help-seeking for affective mental health disorders. A search of the PubMed, APA PsycInfo, and Cochrane databases identified 3961 articles, of which 12 met the inclusion criteria. Six of the studies were qualitative, five were quantitative and one used mixed methods. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the quality of the articles. Five key themes were identified, including the impact of social norms, with the subthemes of conformity to masculine norms and self-stigma, limited availability of information about mental health, and 'male-friendly' mental health literacy campaigns. Other themes referred to the help-seeking preferences of adolescent boys and young men, in terms of informal or formal and online or offline help-seeking. Some of the factors were well-researched (e.g., conformity to masculine norms as a barrier) whereas other factors (e.g., self-compassion as a facilitator) were less researched. These barriers and facilitators need to be considered in the development of future strategies to improve the help-seeking behaviour of adolescent boys and young men.

TI  - An exploration of perspective of knowledge, attitude and help seeking behaviour in pregnant women and their families towards psychiatric ailments in a primary health care setting in South India - A cross sectional study
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Mental illness, often linked to ignorance and superstitions, significantly impacts women's mental health, particularly during pregnancy-marked by significant physical, emotional, and psychological changes. Prenatal mental health screening face challenges like stigma and lack of standardized protocols, while family support is essential reducing stress and enhancing well-being. Aim: To assess knowledge, attitude and help seeking behaviors towards mental ailments among pregnant women and their families visiting primary health centers (PHCs). Methods: A cross-sectional study conducted at a PHC during antenatal checkup days over 1 month recruiting pregnant women and their family members aged >= 18 years. A total of 230 participants were recruited. Data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire and validated scales: Mental Health Knowledge Schedule (MAKS), Community Attitudes towards Mental Illness (CAMI-12 item) and Mental Help Seeking Attitudes Scale (MHSAS). Descriptive statistics, Chi-square test, Student's t-test, one-way ANOVA, Pearson correlation, and linear regression were used. A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Most participants lacked awareness of mental illness during pregnancy and childbirth. Higher education levels among participants correlated with better mental health knowledge. Participants with greater knowledge and positive attitudes demonstrated increased help-seeking behaviors. Positive correlations were observed between mental health knowledge, favorable attitudes, and help-seeking behaviors. Conclusion: Poor knowledge and unfavorable attitude toward mental illness impact help seeking behaviour, among pregnant women and their families, compromising maternal and child health. Intervention to enhance knowledge, and promoting perinatal mental health services are essential to address these gaps.

TI  - Hurricane Katrina: The Childhood Legacy of Disaster Recovery and Resilience
T2  - TRAUMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Research following Hurricane Katrina highlights significant psychological impacts on youth, particularly posttraumatic stress, anxiety, and depression. While most children and adolescents demonstrate adaptability over time, the specific pathways to resilience remain less understood. This study explored longitudinal community data on disaster exposure and traumatic stress across the 10-year recovery period after Katrina. The dataset included 60,703 screenings of children and adolescents from 2005 and 2015 (N = 35,000). Children who met cutoff scores for clinically significant symptoms were compared over time. A series of logistic regressions were conducted to assess factors associated with cutoff scores each year. Results revealed a steady decline in posttraumatic stress: 45% of youth screened positive in 2005 compared to 23% in 2015. The most consistent contributors to elevated symptoms included loneliness, depression, anger, requests to speak with a counselor, and exposure to additional traumas. Other factors-such as property loss, relocation, housing displaced individuals, female gender, older age, and minority status-also contributed, though less strongly and consistently. Findings suggest that immediately after major disasters, roughly half of children experience elevated posttraumatic stress. By the 5-year mark, rates begin to approximate general population concerns (about 25%), with approximately 10% continuing to experience severe or persistent symptoms requiring clinical intervention. These findings underscore the importance of providing school-based mental health education on typical stress reactions and coping strategies, while targeting intensive clinical services for the smaller group with long-term needs. Importantly, youth in this study demonstrated remarkable resilience, offering valuable lessons to guide responses in future disasters.

TI  - What Are the Barriers, Facilitators and Interventions Targeting Help-Seeking Behaviours for Common Mental Health Problems in Adolescents? A Systematic Review.
T2  - Focus (American Psychiatric Publishing)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background: Increasing rates of mental health problems among adolescents are of concern. Teens who are most in need of mental health attention are reluctant to seek help. A better understanding of the help-seeking in this population is needed to overcome this gap.Methods: Five databases were searched to identify the principal barriers, facilitators and interventions targeting help-seeking for common mental health problems in adolescents aged 10-19 years. The search was performed in June 2018 and updated in April 2019. Two independent screening processes were made using the eligibility criteria. Quality assessment of each study was performed, and findings summarised using a narrative synthesis.Results: Ninety studies meet the inclusion criteria for this review for barrier and facilitators (n = 54) and interventions (n = 36). Stigma and negative beliefs towards mental health services and professionals were the most cited barriers. Facilitators included previous positive experience with health services and mental health literacy. Most interventions were based on psychoeducation, which focused on general mental health knowledge, suicide and self-harm, stigma and depression. Other types of interventions included the use of multimedia and online tools, peer training and outreach initiatives. Overall, the quality of studies was low to medium and there was no general agreement regarding help-seeking definition and measurements.Conclusion: Most of the interventions took place in an educational setting however, it is important to consider adolescents outside the educational system. Encouraging help-seeking should come with the increased availability of mental health support for all adolescents in need, but this is still a major challenge for Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services. There is also a need to develop shared definitions, theoretical frameworks and higher methodological standards in research regarding help-seeking behaviours in adolescents. This will allow more consistency and generalisability of findings, improving the development of help-seeking interventions and ensuring timely access to mental health treatments.Appeared originally in BMC Psychiatry 2020; 20:293.

TI  - Exploring Nigerian Universities Online Students' Experiences of Mental Health Supports: Descriptive Phenomenology
T2  - OPEN PRAXIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The reported study investigated the availability of institution-wide mental health support services and action plans for online students to address mental health impairments in Nigerian universities. The research questions explored how Nigerian online students perceived the mental health support services provided by their institutions before, during, and after mental health crises. Employing a descriptive phenomenological paradigm, semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine online students from Nigerian universities. The findings revealed a limited understanding of mental health issues among online students. Additionally, they highlighted the absence of institutional support services or action plans for promoting mental health wellness among Nigerian online students. To address these issues, the study recommends a pre-admission assessment of students' readiness to succeed in the online learning environment, an online learner orientation program, and mental health education to raise awareness of mental health impairment symptoms. This study contributes to the scarce literature on online students' mental health policy and support systems in Nigeria's distance education platforms. Also, it provides online education stakeholders with insights to inform online students' mental health policy. Ultimately, it may foster innovative practices and capacity-building programs among the online learning providers in Nigeria.

TI  - Prevalence and associated factors of suicidal behaviors among Bangladeshi rural community people: Findings from the 'BD ComMen Study'
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Suicide is considered as one of the major public health concerns, which can be prevented with cost-effective and timely intervention. In Bangladesh, very few studies assessed the suicidal behavior of rural community people. Thus, this Bangladesh Community Mental Health Study (BD ComMen Study) attempted to understand the current situation of suicidality in Bangladeshi rural community people considering three-time frames: lifetime, past year, and past month.Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in a rural community in Bangladesh between May 17 and 31, 2022, using a cluster sampling technique. Information on socio-demographics, COVID-19-related factors, depression, anxiety, insomnia, and suicidal behaviors was collected. The Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test and logistic regression were used to analyze the data.Results During their lifetime, 33.1% of the rural community people had suicidal thoughts, whereas 5.5% made a plan for suicide and 1.8% attempted suicide. The prevalence of past-year suicidal ideation was 3.9%, whereas 1.4% had a suicide plan. In addition, 0.6% had past-month suicidal thoughts, although none of them had planned or attempted suicide. The factors associated with suicidal behaviors included males, lower age, lower educational grade, low-earning jobs, living in a government-provided house, family history of mental health and suicide, and suffering from anxiety and insomnia.Conclusions Suicidal behaviors among the rural community people are of great concern as most of the rural people in Bangladesh do not have enough mental health literacy for treatment-seeking due to a high level of mental health-related stigma. Thus, this study would likely help to initiate further studies and stimulate suicide prevention programs, because most suicide can be prevented.

TI  - Effects of a flexibly delivered group-based acceptance and commitment therapy on reducing stress and enhancing psychological wellbeing in parents of school-age children during the COVID-19 pandemic: a quasi-experimental study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction COVID-19 has increased parental stress and significantly impacted the psychological well-being of individuals, especially parents of school-age children. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy posits that individuals can accept their unchangeable inner experiences (thoughts and feelings) while acting in ways aligned with their personal values, demonstrating effectiveness in reducing stress and improving psychological well-being, especially among parents of children with chronic illness. This study aimed to test the effectiveness of a group-based ACT, delivered flexibly, in improving stress and psychological well-being in parents with school-age children, regardless of their children's chronic conditions, within a real-world context.Methods This quasi-experimental study recruited parents with school-age children, through convenience sampling from the Christian Family Service Centre in Hong Kong. The group-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy intervention consisted of five weekly sessions delivered via face-to-face meetings and online videoconferencing, consistent with participants' preferences and COVID-19 related restrictions in Hong Kong. Paired t-tests and Generalized Estimating Equations following the intention-to-treat principle were used to examine the overall effects and the moderating effects of delivery methods.Results The study included 250 parents, with an average age of 40.90 years, mostly women. The average age of their youngest child was 7.68 years. In line with COVID-19-related restrictions and participants' preferences, 109 parents participated in online sessions, while 141 attended face-to-face sessions. Results showed significant small-to-medium improvements in various outcome variables after the intervention, including parental stress (Cohen's d = 0.26), general stress (d = 0.18), depressive symptoms (d = 0.18), mental health literacy (d = 0.43), subjective wellbeing (d = 0.25), and psychological flexibility (d = 0.28). Notably, the online videoconferencing format was found to be as effective as the face-to-face format, with similar session attendance rates.Conclusion The findings highlight the potential of group-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy to alleviate stress and improve psychological well-being in parents of school-age children, regardless of the delivery method, especially during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. However, due to limitations in the study design, caution is warranted when interpreting the overall effects of group-based ACT on parent outcomes and the moderating role of delivery methods. Further research is needed to validate these findings and explore the nuances of delivery methods in similar real-world situations.

TI  - Psychoeducation for individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis: A scoping review
T2  - SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Psychoeducation is recommended in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia and has been shown to improve satisfaction with mental health service and treatment adherence, reduce relapse and hospital read-mission rates, and enhance functioning and quality of life. Youth at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR) may also benefit from receiving psychoeducation as part of their treatment. The goal of this study was to conduct a scoping review to map out the existing literature on psychoeducation for CHR individuals, including content, utilization, and benefits, in order to identify areas for future research and clinical care. Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic search of electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection) to identify literature through 02/25/2022 that provided data or significant commentary about the provision of psychoeducation to CHR individuals. After screening titles and abstracts, four co-authors assessed full-text articles for eligibility. Thirty-three studies were included in the review. Psycho -education is recommended in the treatment of CHR individuals, is a preferred treatment option among CHR individuals, and many CHR programs report offering psychoeducation. However, details about the psycho -educational content and method of delivery are notably absent from recommendations and reports on the provision of CHR psychoeducation in real-world settings. We identified two brief and structured CHR psycho -education interventions and one longer-term psychoeducational multifamily group model for CHR that show feasibility and promise, though they have not yet undergone randomized trials to evaluate effectiveness of the psychoeducation. We also identified several comprehensive CHR interventions that included an explicit psy-choeducation module, though the unique role of the psychoeducational component is unknown. Despite being recommended as a critical component of treatment for CHR individuals and preferred by CHR individuals, the ways in which psychoeducation are being delivered to CHR individuals in real-world practice is still largely ambiguous. Rigorous evaluations of psychoeducation treatment models are needed, as well as investment from clinical programs to facilitate the implementation and dissemination of standardized psychoeducation for CHR individuals.

TI  - Managing daily responsibilities among collegiate student-athletes: Examining the roles of stress, sleep, and sense of belonging
T2  - JOURNAL OF AMERICAN COLLEGE HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Student-athletes are unique in their undertaking of full-time academic and athletic roles. Their dual roles impose a multitude of responsibilities in their daily lives, yet little is known about the factors that may negatively impact their ability to effectively manage these responsibilities. Participants: Data from a large sample of Canadian varsity athletes (N = 1,353) were used for the present study. Methods: The association between stress and difficulties managing daily responsibilities, while simultaneously investigating the roles of sleep difficulties and sense of belonging as contributing factors was examined. Results: Findings indicated that the moderated mediation model was significant, revealing that sleep difficulties were a significant mediator in the relationship between stress and difficulties managing daily responsibilities and that sense of belonging moderated the relationship between stress and sleep difficulties. Conclusions: The results expose complex ways that student-athletes' performances (academic and athletic) can be impaired, signaling the need to develop strategic actions toward prevention and management of stress among student-athletes.

TI  - Evaluating the message of an ongoing communication campaign to reduce the duration of untreated psychosis in a Latinx community in the United States
T2  - EARLY INTERVENTION IN PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Initiatives aimed at reducing the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) attempt to increase the community's level of psychosis literacy. Most of these efforts, however, have failed to reduce DUP. One plausible explanation is that the campaigns do not actually increase psychosis literacy. To date, there have been few efforts to assess whether the campaign messaging does indeed increase psychosis literacy prior to or during the campaign. This study evaluated whether the message of the La CLAve DUP reduction program delivered during the campaign increased the psychosis literacy of a U.S. Latinx community.Methods The sample consisted of 81 Latinx community residents aged 15-84. Two community health educators of the La CLAve campaign facilitated workshops using a narrative film to initiate a conversation in the community about the signs of psychosis and the importance of professional help-seeking early in the illness course. Psychosis literacy was assessed via questionnaires pertaining to a hypothetical vignette administered before and after the workshops.Results The psychosis literacy of participants increased after the workshops in several domains. Participants' knowledge of multiple psychotic symptoms, self-efficacy in their ability to recognize psychosis in others, and correct attributions of a hypothetical vignette's psychotic symptoms significantly increased. No changes were observed in recommendations for professional help-seeking.Conclusions These findings provide support for the effectiveness of the La CLAve messaging in increasing psychosis literacy of U.S. Latinx community residents. Evidence-based campaign messaging is needed to increase the success of DUP reduction programs especially among underserved communities.

TI  - The dynamic association between depression, psychological flexibility, and meaning in life among medical students: a cross-lagged analysis
T2  - BMC PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundMedical students face significant challenges with depression, where psychological flexibility and meaning in life serve as protective factors that can mitigate the worsening of depressive symptoms. This study employs a two-wave panel design to explore the dynamic relationships among psychological flexibility, meaning in life, and depression in medical students.MethodsThe study utilized panel data from two time points, tracking 1,837 medical students over a 12-week interval. Measurement tools included a demographic information form, the Acceptance and Commitment Therapy Comprehensive Assessment Questionnaire, the Meaning in Life Questionnaire, and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Descriptive analysis, correlation analysis, and cross-lagged analysis were conducted on the variables.ResultsA relationship was found between higher levels of psychological flexibility and lower levels of depression. Autoregressive models indicated that all three variables showed significant stability over time. Cross-lagged analysis found that higher psychological flexibility at Time 1 was associated with lower depression at Time 2, but meaning in life was not associated with subsequent depression. In contrast, higher depression at Time 1 was associated with lower subsequent psychological flexibility and meaning in life. Additionally, gender did not have a significant association with these variables.ConclusionThis study underscores the unique advantages of universities in the mental health education of medical students. It recommends enhancing psychological flexibility and meaning in life through mindfulness training, emotional regulation courses, and professional values education to effectively prevent the onset of depression.Clinical trial numberNot applicable.

TI  - An intervention to improve the quality of life in children of parents with serious mental illness: the Young SMILES feasibility RCT
T2  - HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Quality of life for children and adolescents living with serious parental mental illness can be impaired, but evidence-based interventions to improve it are scarce.Objective: Co-production of a child-centred intervention [called Young Simplifying Mental Illness plus Life Enhancement Skills (SMILES)] to improve the health-related quality of life of children and adolescents living with serious parental mental illness, and evaluating its acceptability and feasibility for delivery in NHS and community settings.Design: Qualitative and co-production methods informed the development of the intervention (Phase I). A feasibility randomised controlled trial was designed to compare Young SMILES with treatment as usual (Phase II). Semistructured qualitative interviews were used to explore acceptability among children and adolescents living with their parents, who had serious mental illness, and their parents. A mixture of semistructured qualitative interviews and focus group research was used to examine feasibility among Young SMILES facilitators and referrers/non-referrers.Setting: Randomisation was conducted after baseline measures were collected by the study co-ordinator, ensuring that the blinding of the statistician and research team was maintained to reduce detection bias.Participants: Phase I: 14 children and adolescents living with serious parental mental illness, seven parents and 31 practitioners from social, educational and health-related sectors. Phase II: 40 children and adolescents living with serious parental mental illness, 33 parents, five referrers/non-referrers and 16 Young SMILES facilitators.Intervention: Young SMILES was delivered at two sites: (1) Warrington, supported by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), and (2) Newcastle, supported by the NHS and Barnardo's. An eight-session weekly group programme was delivered, with four to six children and adolescents living with serious parental mental illness per age-appropriate group (6-11 and 12-16 years). At week 4, a five-session parallel weekly programme was offered to the parents/carers. Sessions lasted 2 hours each and focused on improving mental health literacy, child-parent communication and children's problem-solving skills.Main outcome measures: Phase ll children and parents completed questionnaires at randomisation and then again at 4 and 6 months post randomisation. Quality of life was self-reported by children and proxy-reported by parents using the Paediatric Quality of Life questionnaire and KIDSCREEN. Semistructured interviews with parents (n = 14) and children (n = 17) who participated in the Young SMILES groups gathered information about their motivation to sign up to the study, their experiences of participating in the group sessions, and their perceived changes in themselves and their family members following intervention. Further interviews with individual referrers (n = 5) gathered information about challenges to recruitment and randomisation. Two focus groups (n = 16) with practitioners who facilitated the intervention explored their views of the format and content of the Young SMILES manual and their suggestions for changes.Results: A total of 35 families were recruited: 20 were randomly allocated to Young SMILES group and 15 to treatment as usual. Of those, 28 families [15/20 (75%) in the intervention group and 13/15 (87%) in the control group] gave follow-up data at the primary end point (4 months post baseline). Participating children had high adherence to the intervention and high completion rates of the questionnaires. Children and adolescents living with their parents, who had serious mental illness, and their parents were mainly very positive and enthusiastic about Young SMILES, both of whom invoked the benefits of peer support and insight into parental difficulties. Although facilitators regarded Young SMILES as a meaningful and distinctive intervention having great potential, referrers identified several barriers to referring families to the study. One harm was reported by a parent, which was dealt with by the research team and the NSPCC in accordance with the standard operating procedures.Limitations: The findings from our feasibility study are not sufficient to recommend a fully powered trial of Young SMILES in the near future. Although it was feasible to randomise children and adolescents living with serious parental mental illness of different ages to standardised, time-limited groups in both NHS and non-NHS settings, an intervention like Young SMILES is unlikely to address underlying core components of the vulnerability that children and adolescents living with serious parental mental illness express as a population over time.Conclusions: Young SMILES was widely valued as unique in filling a recognised gap in need. Outcome measures in future studies of interventions for children and adolescents living with serious parental mental illness are more likely to capture change in individual risk factors for reduced quality of life by considering their unmet need, rather than on an aggregate construct of health-related quality of life overall, which may not reflect these young people's needs.Future work: A public health approach to intervention might be best. Most children and adolescents living with serious parental mental illness remain well most of the time, so, although their absolute risks are low across outcomes (and most will remain resilient most of the time), consistent population estimates find their relative risk to be high compared with unexposed children. A public health approach to intervention needs to be both tailored to the particular needs of children and adolescents living with serious parental mental illness and agile to these needs so that it can respond to fluctuations over time.

TI  - National Cross-Sectional Study of Mental Health Screening Practices for Primary Caregivers of NICU Infants
T2  - CHILDREN-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Universal screening for postpartum mood and anxiety disorders (PMADs) has been recommended for all new parents at outpatient postpartum and well-child visits. However, parents of newborns admitted to the NICU are rarely able to access these services during their infant's prolonged hospitalization. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of mental health screening and treatment programs for parents or other primary caregivers in NICUs across the country. In this cross-sectional study, US NICU medical directors were invited to complete an online survey about current practices in mental health education, screening, and treatment for primary caregivers of preterm and ill infants in the NICU. Comparative analyses using Fisher's exact test were performed to evaluate differences in practices among various NICU practice settings. Survey responses were obtained from 75 out of 700 potential sites (10.7%). Of participating NICUs, less than half routinely provided caregivers with psychoeducation about mental health self-care (n = 35, 47%) or routinely screened caregivers for PPD or other mental health disorders (n = 33, 44%). Nearly one-quarter of the NICUs did not provide any PMAD screening (n = 17, 23%). Despite consensus that postpartum psychosocial care is essential, routine mental health care of primary caregivers in the NICU remains inadequate.

TI  - Inequitable access to mental healthcare for socially excluded adolescents
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Adolescence is a critical period for mental health and social exclusion, a key social determinant of mental health. Early intervention approaches are key to mitigating the impact of mental ill-health during adolescence, however social exclusion can create additional barriers to accessing care.Aim: We aimed to better understand help-seeking experiences of adolescents facing co-occurring social exclusion and mental ill-health, including sources of support, barriers and preferences for service provision.Method: Cross-sectional data were analysed, from the 2022 Mission Australia Youth Survey (N = 18,800). Adolescents aged 15 to 19 years were recruited from around Australia, through schools, community organisations and digital platforms. Indices of four domains of social exclusion (housing, finances, relational and education/employment) were created using existing Youth Survey variables, and supplemented with demographic characteristics, psychological distress and help-seeking behaviours (perceived need, mental health supports, barriers to access and preferences). Relationships between social exclusion domains, mental health concerns and help-seeking behaviours were explored using logistic regression models.Results: A total of 9,743 young people reported having needed mental health support, yet only 58.1% reportedly sought support (n = 5,565). Social exclusion domains were associated with different help-seeking behaviours: housing challenges with higher help-seeking (OR = 1.28; 95% CI [1.15, 1.42]); relational difficulties and edu-employment issues with lower (OR = 0.75; 95% CI [0.68, 0.83] and OR = 0.82; 95% CI [0.75, 0.89]). Stigma, confidentiality concerns, cost and not knowing where to seek help were common barriers to help-seeking; those experiencing social exclusion more likely to report these. Participants reported a strong preference for face-to-face support.Conclusions: This study highlights the additional needs and challenges faced by adolescents dealing with both social exclusion and mental ill-health. With greater barriers to help-seeking, concerted efforts are needed to reduce stigma, improve mental health literacy and increase access to trusted information sources. Further initiatives should focus on structural factors that socially exclude young people and exacerbate inequitable access to mental healthcare.

TI  - Physical activity and internalization problems in middle school students: the chain mediating role of rumination thinking and peer acceptance
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores methods to improve internalizing problems in middle school students through physical exercise, aiming to construct a mediational model that includes physical exercise, Rumination, peer acceptance, and internalizing problems. The model examines the interactions and influence pathways among these variables to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanism through which physical exercise impacts internalizing problems in middle school students. 671 junior high school students were surveyed by physical exercise scale, Rumination scale, peer acceptance scale and internalization question scale. SPSS26.0 was used to analyze the data, followed by descriptive analysis, reliability analysis, Pearson correlation analysis, Harman single factor test and Bootstrap analysis. (1) Physical exercise was negatively correlated with internalizing problems (r = - 0.286), but the direct path between physical exercise and internalizing problems was not statistically significant (beta = - 0.060, p > 0.05, CI [- 0.137, 0.018]); (2) Physical exercise was significantly negatively correlated with Rumination (beta = - 0.174, p < 0.001, CI [- 0.255, - 0.094]) and significantly positively correlated with peer acceptance (beta = 0.357, p < 0.001, CI [0.286, 0.429]). Rumination was significantly negatively correlated with peer acceptance (beta = - 0.128, p < 0.001, CI [- 0.199, - 0.056]) and significantly positively correlated with internalizing problems (beta = 0.289, p < 0.001, CI [0.222, 0.356]); peer acceptance was significantly negatively correlated with internalizing problems (beta = - 0.372, p < 0.001, CI [- 0.448, - 0.296]). (3) The total effect of the chain mediation model was - 0.251, and the direct effect of physical exercise and internalized problems was - 0.059,The total effect accounted for 23.51%, Rumination and Peer acceptance played a mediating role between physical exercise and internalized behavior problems, and the total indirect effect size was - 0.192, The total effect accounted for 76.49%. The mediating effect values of Rumination and Peer acceptance between physical exercise and internalized behavior problems were - 0.050 and - 0.133, accounting for 19.92% and 52.99%, respectively. The chain-mediated effect between Rumination and Peer acceptance between physical exercise and internalized behavior problems was - 0.008, and the chain-mediated effect accounted for 3.19%. Physical exercise is negatively correlated with internalization, Rumination is negatively correlated with peer acceptance; Rumination and peer acceptance, as mediating variables, not only play an independent mediating role between physical exercise and junior high school students' internalization problems, but also further strengthen their role in junior high school students' internalization problems through chain mediation. Although the effect value of chain mediation is small, it is worthy of attention, suggesting that there is a synergistic effect among the variables. The results of this study provide an important reference for the design of school physical exercise curriculum. Through reasonable design of physical education curriculum, the interest and attraction of physical exercise can be increased, and the participation of students can be improved indirectly, thus promoting the improvement of internalization problems.At the same time, it can be considered to combine physical exercise with mental health education, and cultivate students' methods and abilities to cope with pressure and negative emotions through physical exercise courses, cultivate positive and optimistic attitude, and improve junior middle school students' mental toughness and social adaptability.

TI  - Methamphetamine use awareness, prevalence and socio-demographic risk factors among in-school adolescents in Ebonyi state, Nigeria
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Methamphetamine (MA) use is on the rise in Nigeria with the dire consequences to the adolescent's mental health, education, and society. Despite the pervasiveness and accessibility of the drug, relatively little research has examined in-school adolescents. Our study explored in-school adolescents MA use awareness, sources of information, prevalence and socio-demographic risk factors. A cross-sectional analytical design was applied, drawing on data from in-school adolescents between the ages of 10 and 19 in Ebonyi state. The participants were recruited using a multistage sampling procedure, while a semi-structured questionnaire was used for data collection. Percentages were used to analyze data on MA use awareness, sources of information, and prevalence, while multivariable logistic regression adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were used to analyze the association between socio-demographic risk factors and MA use. The level of significance was set at P < 0.05. The results reveal that the majority of in-school adolescents have MA use awareness (95.1 %). Social media, [Facebook/WhatsApp] were the most prominent sources of information (93.2 %). The lifetime prevalence of MA use was 19.2 %, past year 19.9 %, past month 23.5 %, and past week 7.8 %. The adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for socio-factors show peer pressure/friends was 3.22 times (P< 0.05) more likely than others to predict MA use. Demographic factors show that on-campus adolescents were 3.7 times, off-campus 4.23 times (P< 0.05) more likely than family house to predict MA. Being polygamous was 2.28 times, single parent 2.92 times more likely than being monogamous to predict MA, (P< 0.05). Being a traditional worshiper was 9.52 times less likely than being Christian, (P< 0.05), while being Muslim had no association with MA use (P< 0.05).These findings highlight the potential of adopting a multi-sectorial approach to tackle MA use, including social media use intervention, parental monitoring/support, therapists for risk behaviour counseling, scale-up school-based intervention policy/laws for early use prevention.

TI  - Psychiatric disorders in China: strengths and challenges of contemporary research and clinical services
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - China accounts for 17% of the global disease burden attributable to mental, neurological and substance use disorders. As a country undergoing profound societal change, China faces growing challenges to reduce the disease burden caused by psychiatric disorders. In this review, we aim to present an overview of progress in neuroscience research and clinical services for psychiatric disorders in China during the past three decades, analysing contributing factors and potential challenges to the field development. We first review studies in the epidemiological, genetic and neuroimaging fields as examples to illustrate a growing contribution of studies from China to the neuroscience research. Next, we introduce large-scale, open-access imaging genetic cohorts and recently initiated brain banks in China as platforms to study healthy brain functions and brain disorders. Then, we show progress in clinical services, including an integration of hospital and community-based healthcare systems and early intervention schemes. We finally discuss opportunities and existing challenges: achievements in research and clinical services are indispensable to the growing funding investment and continued engagement in international collaborations. The unique aspect of traditional Chinese medicine may provide insights to develop a novel treatment for psychiatric disorders. Yet obstacles still remain to promote research quality and to provide ubiquitous clinical services to vulnerable populations. Taken together, we expect to see a sustained advancement in psychiatric research and healthcare system in China. These achievements will contribute to the global efforts to realize good physical, mental and social well-being for all individuals.

AB  - BackgroundImmigrant students face various challenges in high-income countries that can contribute to the decline of their mental well-being upon arrival in their host country. Despite the growing population of these students in several high-income countries, there is inadequate attention given to their mental health needs and their access to mental health services. Thus, this systematic scoping review aimed to identify gaps in existing research relating to the barriers and facilitators associated with access to and use of mental health services in high-income countries.MethodsFollowing the PRISMA-ScR checklist as guidance we systematically searched Ovid Medline, APA PsycInfo, Education Source, CINAHL, Web of Science databases for peer reviewed articles related to barriers and facilitators of mental health service use among immigrant students. We conducted a narrative evidence synthesis to highlight barriers and facilitators to the use of mental health services.ResultsOut of the 2407 articles initially found, 47 studies met the inclusion criteria and were considered for this review. The increasing attention towards the mental health concerns of immigrant students and their access to mental health services is evident. However, various barriers like stigma, insufficient knowledge, or adherence to traditional gender roles (such as masculinity) hinder their utilization of these services. On the other hand, factors such as being a woman, having a strong sense of cultural adaptation, or possessing adequate mental health literacy serve as facilitators for accessing mental health services.ConclusionThese students have unique experiences, and their needs are often unmet. To improve their mental health and use of mental health services, it is important to consider the barriers they face and their unique experience in their specific life context and to develop tailored prevention and intervention programs.

TI  - Design and Implementation of Mental Health Consultation System for Primary and Secondary School Students Based on Credibility Matching Model (Retracted Article)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
M3  - Retracted Publication
AB  - Primary and secondary schools have the enormous responsibility of developing talent over a hundred years, and they should not only be concerned with the moral, ideological, and cultural development of teenagers but also with their mental well-being. We need to start by making the external environment better, provide in-depth psychological counseling, and support students as they work to continually increase their psychological adaptability in order to promote the healthy development of their personalities. As the epidemic situation in China has now stabilized into a normal state of prevention and control, it is imperative to provide primary and secondary school students with mental health education. In light of this context, this paper develops a browser-server network architecture-based consultation system for the mental health of students in primary and secondary schools. It eliminates the conventional booking mode and substitutes credibility as the characteristic programming parameter. The performance of the original system is improved by the reliability model the most when the parameter is set to 0.2, and the recovery rate rises by 1.32 percent. Compared to the original reliability model, which improved the system's F value performance by 0.83 percent, the accuracy rate only declines by 0.68 percent while F rises by 0.37 percent. This research is crucial for creating an information campus and raising the standard of psychological counseling.

TI  - A Systematic Review of Help-Seeking Interventions for Parents of Adolescents
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose: Parents do not always seek timely help for adolescents when the need arises. Although interventions to increase parental help-seeking have been evaluated and published, no systematic review of these interventions has been conducted. The aim of this systematic review is to collate, synthesise, and evaluate research on help-seeking interventions for parents of adolescents. Methods: Six electronic databases were searched from inception to May 2020 using terms related to the concepts of "parent" and "help-seeking" and focusing on parents of adolescents (aged 10-19 years). Methodological quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies; the Behavioural Change Taxonomy was used to code behavioral change techniques, and "promising interventions" were identified using pre-established criteria. Results: Eighteen studies met inclusion criteria, with six rated strong for design and methodology. The most frequently identified Behavioural Change Taxonomies included a credible source delivering the intervention, supporting parents, and providing prompts/cues regarding services/ appointments. Four interventions were identified as "promising" because of strong methodology, significant positive outcomes, and strong evidence-base. Conclusions: More high-quality, theory-driven parental help-seeking interventions using common outcome measures are needed to advance the literature in this area. Future research should replicate the promising interventions identified to develop best practice guidelines. (c) 2021 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Co-designing psychosis simulated patient scenarios with mental health stakeholders for pharmacy curricula
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundPharmacists need knowledge and confidence to support people living with mental illness. Evidence-based educational materials for pharmacy students to provide psychosis care is limited.AimTo co-design, content validate and pilot-test, with mental health stakeholders, simulated patient scenarios to educate and assess students in providing psychosis care.MethodMental health consumers were invited to co-design three simulated patient scenarios (first-episode psychosis, carer of someone living with schizophrenia, non-adherence to antipsychotics), guided by published and psychometrically-tested materials. A panel of mental health stakeholders participated in two rounds of content validation (RAND/UCLA appropriateness model). Round 1 involved individual survey completion to calculate item content validity index (I-CVI) for relevance/clarity, content validity ratio for essentiality and overall scale content validity index (S-CVI/Ave and S-CVI/UA) scores for each scenario. Scores analyses and feedback comments informed revisions. Round 2 involved a panel meeting to discuss revisions and finalise content. The scenarios were then pilot-tested with pharmacy students.ResultsTwo consumers participated in co-design, nine stakeholders in content validation. All items showed excellent content validity for relevance/clarity. Eleven items were revised for essentiality, discussed, then re-rated at the panel meeting for consensus. The scenarios were pilot-tested with pharmacy students (n = 15) and reported to be realistic and relevant to future practice, contributing to students' confidence in supporting people experiencing mental health symptoms or crises.ConclusionPartnering with mental health stakeholders has enabled co-design of authentic, content valid educational materials for pharmacy students to provide psychosis care, in preparation for future provision of mental health support.

TI  - Mental health outcomes, literacy and service provision in low- and middle-income settings: a systematic review of the Democratic Republic of the Congo
T2  - NPJ MENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the prevalence of mental health issues could be greater than in other low-income and middle-income countries because of major risk factors related to armed conflicts and poverty. Given that mental health is an essential component of health, it is surprising that no systematic evaluation of mental health in the DRC has yet been undertaken. This study aims to undertake the first systematic review of mental health literacy and service provision in the DRC, to bridge this gap and inform those who need to develop an evidence base. This could support policymakers in tackling the issues related to limited mental health systems and service provision in DRC. Following Cochrane and PRISMA guidelines, a systematic (Web of Science, Medline, Public Health, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar) search was conducted (January 2000 and August 2023). Combinations of key blocks of terms were used in the search such as DRC, war zone, mental health, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression, sexual violence, war trauma, resilience, mental health systems and service provision. We followed additional sources from reference lists of included studies. Screening was completed in two stages: title and abstract search, and full-text screening for relevance and quality. Overall, 50 studies were included in the review; the majority of studies (n = 31) were conducted in the Eastern region of the DRC, a region devastated by war and sexual violence. Different instruments were used to measure participants' mental health such as the Hopkins Symptoms Checklist (HSCL-25), The Harvard Trauma Questionnaire, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9); General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), and Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS). Our study found that wartime sexual violence and extreme poverty are highly traumatic, and cause multiple, long-term mental health difficulties. We found that depression, anxiety, and PTSD were the most common problems in the DRC. Psychosocial interventions such as group therapy, family support, and socio-economic support were effective in reducing anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms. This systematic review calls attention to the need to support sexual violence survivors and many other Congolese people affected by traumatic events. This review also highlights the need for validating culturally appropriate measures, and the need for well-designed controlled intervention studies in low-income settings such as the DRC. Better public mental health systems and service provision could help to improve community cohesion, human resilience, and mental wellbeing. There is also an urgent need to address wider social issues such as poverty, stigma, and gender inequality in the DRC.

AB  - BackgroundNursing students often feel unprepared to care for patients with psychiatric diagnoses and alcohol use disorder (AUD), leading to low confidence, with fear and stigma impacting care. Simulation offers a way to build these skills.PurposeThis project assessed the effectiveness of standardized patients and tag team simulation in increasing nursing students' exposure and confidence managing mental healthcare and AUD.MethodsA mixed-method pre-post design evaluated student confidence and skills. Students worked in pairs, "tagging" the next pair to continue care. Outcomes measured included the Mental Health Clinical Confidence Scale and student reflections on their simulation experience.ResultsSignificant improvements were found in empathy (p = 0.021), assisting with living skills (p = 0.002), and conducting suicide risk assessments (p = 0.002). Reflections emphasized communication, empathy, and self-reflection as essential to confidence.ConclusionsSimulation enhances confidence and skills. Research should continue to examine standardized patients and tag team methods in mental health training.

TI  - Protocol for a feasibility randomized control trial of the Supporting Toddlers with a connection to autism or ADHD to develop Strong Attention, Regulation, and Thinking skills (START) programme
T2  - PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundAutism and ADHD are heritable, co-occurrent, and associated with difficulties with executive functioning (cognitive and self-regulation skills which enable us to set and work toward goals). Executive function difficulties, and their negative impacts across cognitive, health and social domains, extend to individuals with first-degree relatives who are autistic or have ADHD, even if they do not meet thresholds for a clinical diagnosis themselves. Supporting executive function development in children with elevated autism traits, or a first-degree relative with autism or ADHD, addresses community priorities for early support to help achieve the best mental health, education and life outcomes.MethodsThis study will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a parent-toddler programme entitled "Supporting Toddlers with a connection to autism or ADHD to develop strong Attention, Regulation and Thinking skills" (START). START is a neurodiversity-affirming programme, co-refined through extensive Patient and Public Involvement. Sixty parent-child dyads, in Oxford or Southampton (UK), will be randomized using Sealed Envelope by a researcher not involved in recruitment, delivery or outcome data collection to receive START or usual practice, on a 1:1 ratio. Children (20 months old) will be assessed using questionnaires completed by the parent (not blind to allocation) post-intervention (within 2 weeks of the end of the active intervention wave, when children are aged 27-31 months), and using parent questionnaires and a battery of executive function measures administered by researchers blind to allocation at baseline and follow-up (36 months old). START will be delivered in small groups to 30 parent-child dyads, in community settings.DiscussionWe will assess the feasibility of recruiting eligible participants to the study, the reliability of measures of implementation fidelity and degree of implementation fidelity achieved, the appropriateness of proposed outcome and mechanism measures, the acceptability of an RCT of the programme, parental adherence to the programme, logistics of programme delivery, and the acceptability of START, using mixed-method measures of engagement and satisfaction. Results will inform the design and implementation of a definitive RCT of START, and yield broader insights into the delivery and evaluation of complex early-years interventions in community settings.Trial registrationISRCTN registry ISRCTN99820028 https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN99820028.

TI  - Generation Victoria (GenV): protocol for a longitudinal birth cohort of Victorian children and their parents
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIn a world confronted with new and connected challenges, novel strategies are needed to help children and adults achieve their full potential, to predict, prevent and treat disease, and to achieve equity in services and outcomes. Australia's Generation Victoria (GenV) cohorts are designed for multi-pronged discovery (what could improve outcomes?) and intervention research (what actually works, how much and for whom?). Here, we describe the key features of its protocol.MethodsGenV is a whole-population longitudinal platform open to all approximate to 150,000 children born within a two-year window and residing in the state of Victoria and their parents. GenV is guided by its 6 principles of Inclusivity, Collaboration, Sustainability, Enhancement, Systematised Processes and Value and enabled by large-scale biobanking, IT and novel high-throughput technology infrastructure. Successive recruitment phases were designed to maximise GenV's inclusivity: (1) a smaller Advance Cohort from December 2020; (2) Newborn recruitment, with presence in 58 Victorian maternity services supporting face-to-face approach to parents of babies born 4 October 2021-3 October 2023; (3) Intensive remote recruitment to mid-2024 targeting those missed around birth; and (4) Ongoing indefinite enrolment of in-age children and their parents. Participants consent to universal (1) data linkage (e.g., state and federal physical and mental health, education, social, geospatial, ecological); (2) biosamples storage and use (e.g., residual clinical pregnancy and newborn screening, GenV-collected perinatal parent/infant saliva); (3) phenotypic and biosamples collection waves at child ages 6, 11 and 16 years, likely in schools and remotely for parents; and (4) opportunities for collaborative research integrated into GenV as a population registry (e.g., trials, natural experiments, depth subcohorts). Many participants supplement universal data with additional biosamples (e.g., infant stool, breast milk) and brief digital remote 'GenV and Me' assessments over the first 5 years. GenV will make all research data available, adhering to the principles of Open Science.DiscussionLaunched in the COVID-19 pandemic and committed to diversity and inclusivity, GenV's parallel consented child and pre-midlife cohorts will be positioned to help address today's pressing issues such as chronic mental and physical health conditions, inequity, public health crises such as pandemics, and climate harm.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05394363; retrospectively registered 23 May 2022 (8 months into recruitment).

AB  - Background Mental health problems, such as behavioural and emotional problems, are prevalent in children. These problems can have long lasting, detrimental effects on the child, their parents and society. Most children with a mental health problem do not receive professional help. Those that do get help can face long wait times. While waiting, parents want to learn how they can help their child. To address this need, we co-designed a new website to help parents find ways of helping their child's mental health problem while waiting to get specialist help.Objectives To assess the acceptability and feasibility of a new co-designed website, FindWays, through a pilot randomised controlled trial. The protocol is registered with ISRCTN (ISRCTN64605513).Methods This study will recruit up to 60 parents of children aged two-twelve years old referred to a paediatrician for behavioural and/or emotional problems. Participants will be randomly allocated by computer generated number sequence to either the intervention or control group. Intervention group participants will receive access to the FindWays website to help them manage their child's mental health problem while they wait to see the paediatrician. Acceptability and feasibility will be assessed over the 4-month intervention through mixed methods including: recruitment, adherence, retention, net promoter score (quantitative measures) and semi-structured interviews to gain an in-depth understanding of parents' experience and potential adverse effects (qualitative measure). Secondary outcomes measured by parent survey at 4-months post randomisation include child mental health, parent mental health, impact of the child's mental health problem on their functioning and family, and health service use and associated costs.Results Recruitment commenced June 2022 with publication expected in October 2023.ConclusionThis study will provide novel data on the acceptability and feasibility of a new website co-designed with parents to help them find ways of managing their child's behaviour and emotions.

TI  - How Managers Find Out About Common Mental Disorders Among Their Employees
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To explore how managers find out about common mental disorders (CMDs) among employees and associations with managers' work- and knowledge-related characteristics and attitude to CMDs. Methods: Data from an online survey in 2017 with Swedish managers (n = 1810) were used. Different ways managers find out about CMDs were measured, and multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted for associations with manager characteristics. Results: Few managers found out about CMDs themselves; another source was more common, for example, employees' self-disclosure. Managers' overseeing fewer subordinates and those with a negative attitude to depression were more likely to find out about CMDs themselves. The significance of mental health training and education could not be established. Conclusion: Managers' awareness about employees' CMDs mainly came about through employees' self-disclosure. Managers' attitudes and work conditions were related to the way of finding out.

TI  - Mirrors for Pacific Islander Children: Teaching Resilience Through Culturally Adapted Bibliotherapy.
T2  - International journal of environmental research and public health
M3  - Clinical Trial
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Pacific Islander youth face disproportionately high rates of suicide and mental health challenges, yet culturally appropriate interventions remain scarce. This study investigated whether culturally adapted bibliotherapy could effectively promote resilience in American Samoan children by incorporating culturally relevant stories and coping strategies. Through collaboration with on-island Samoan cultural brokers, we developed and implemented culturally adapted stories and lessons designed to resonate with the experiences of children in American Samoa. The study employed a mixed-methods approach with 34 American Samoan children aged 5-13 years, using observations, adapted card sorts, and forced-choice procedures to measure responses to the intervention. The results demonstrated that participants showed strong identification with the culturally adapted stories and characters, actively engaged with the embedded coping strategies, and reported increased confidence in applying resilience techniques. These findings suggest that culturally adapted bibliotherapy holds promise as an effective method for promoting resilience in Pacific Islander children while highlighting the importance of cultural authenticity in mental health interventions.

T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH BEHAVIOR
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Our aim was to explore the collaborative improvement of children's music appreciation ability and mental health level, so as to promote the application of music education in preschool children's mental health education activities.Methods: We first established a mathematical model for the degree of order and degree of collaboration of the complex system for the collaborative improvement of preschool children's music appreciation ability and mental health level; and then, based on the evolutionary game theory, we analyzed the choices of strategy in the 2 subsystems- music appreciation ability cultivation and mental health improvement-in the process of collaborative cultivation; finally, we investigated the preschool children's music appreciation ability and mental health level before and after the implementation of the collaborative improvement mechanism, and conducted regression analysis and correlation analysis on preschool children's music appreciation ability and mental health level.Results: We found that with the improvement of music appreciation ability, the mental health level of preschool children also improved. After the implementation of the collaborative improvement mechanism, all indicators of the music appreciation ability and mental health level of the preschool children were higher than those before the implementation of the mechanism.Conclusions: There is a positive correlation between preschool children's music appreciation ability and their mental health level, and the collaborative improvement mechanism proposed is effective.

TI  - Psychoeducation as an active ingredient for interventions for perinatal depression and anxiety in youth: a mixed-method systematic literature review and lived experience synthesis
T2  - BJPSYCH OPEN
M3  - Review
AB  - BackgroundPsychoeducation is a common element in psychological interventions for youth depression and anxiety, but evidence about its use with youth perinatally is limited.AimsThis review aims to understand outcomes and mechanisms of psychoeducation for the indicated prevention and treatment of perinatal depression and anxiety in youth.MethodFor this review, we synthesised published quantitative and qualitative evidence. Seven databases (ASSIA, Medline, PubMed, PsycINFO, PsycArticles, Scopus and Web of Science) were searched for studies published before 10 August 2021. We also had consultations with a youth advisory group (N = 12).ResultsIn total, 20 studies met the inclusion criteria. Seven quantitative studies examined multicomponent interventions that included psychoeducation, and one study evaluated psychoeducation as a standalone intervention for postnatal depression. Multicomponent interventions showed significant effects on postnatal depression in two out of six studies, as well as being effective at reducing prenatal anxiety in one study. Standalone psychoeducation for postnatal depression was also effective in one study. Evidence from 12 qualitative studies, corroborated by commentaries from the youth advisory group, suggested that psychoeducation could increase knowledge about symptoms, generate awareness of relevant services and enhance coping.ConclusionsPsychoeducation may be an important foundational ingredient of interventions for perinatal depression and, potentially, anxiety in adolescents and young adults through stimulating help-seeking and self-care.

TI  - Machine learning based model for detecting depression during Covid-19 crisis
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Covid-19 has impacted negatively on people all over the world. Some of the ways that it has affected people include such as Health, Employment, Mental Health, Education, Social isolation, Economic Inequality and Access to healthcare and essential services. Apart from physical symptoms, it has caused considerable damage to mental health of individuals. Among all, depression is identified as one of the common illnesses which leads to early death. People suffering from depression are at a higher risk of developing other health conditions, such as heart disease and stroke, and are also at a higher risk of suicide. The importance of early detection and intervention of depression cannot be overstated. Iden-tifying and treating depression early can prevent the illness from becoming more severe and can also prevent the development of other health conditions. Early detection can also prevent suicide, which is a leading cause of death among people with depression. Millions of people have affected from this disease. To proceed with the study of depres-sion detection among individuals we have conducted a survey with 21 questions based on Hamilton tool and advise of psychiatrist. With the use of Python's scientific programming principles and machine learning methods like Decision Tree, KNN, and Naive Bayes, survey results were analysed. Further a comparison of these techniques is done. Study concludes that KNN has given better results than other techniques based on the accuracy and de-cision tree has given better results in the terms of latency to detect the depression of a person. At the conclusion, a machine learning-based model is suggested to replace the con-ventional method of detecting sadness by asking people encouraging questions and getting regular feedback from them.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

TI  - The Arabic Version of the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2): Psychometric Evaluation Among Mothers of Children With Intellectual Disabilities
T2  - NURSING RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: Mothers of children with intellectual disabilities are particularly vulnerable to mental distress due to demanding and exhausting caregiving. However, in the Arab world, they are seldom screened for depression because of limited diagnostic resources. Addressing the urgent need for brief and reliable screening tools, this study evaluated the psychometric properties of the Arabic version of the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) among 85 Saudi mothers. Design: A cross-sectional study. Methods: The construct, convergent, and divergent validity of the PHQ-2 was examined through a latent variable model (LVM), while its cutoff score was examined through receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results: The unidimensional PHQ-2 (item loadings > 0.7) was positively predicted by stress and negatively predicted by high mood and happiness, supporting its convergent and divergent validity. The PHQ-2 effectively predicted low mood, poor sleep quality, nightmares, high stress, low general physical health, and willingness to join a psychological support program (area under the curve [AUC] range = 0.72-0.84, p values < 0.001). The best balance between sensitivity and specificity was achieved at the PHQ-2 threshold >= 2.5, while the cutoff >= 3.5 demonstrated a higher positive predictive value (PPV) for all outcomes (range = 30.0-78.8 vs. 23.0-70.8). Conclusions: The PHQ-2 is a brief, valid tool, which at cutoffs >= 2.5 and >= 3.5 can reliably detect clinically significant depression and related psychological and physical adverse effects. Mothers scoring >= 3.5 may require a clinician-based examination for depression, and they may benefit from specific mental health literacy interventions. However, the results should be interpreted with caution given convenience sampling, a small sample size, and elevated distress levels in the current population. These limitations highlight the need to replicate the study with larger, randomly selected samples from more diverse populations. Implications for Practice: Nurses can efficiently screen for depression and its mental/physical sequelae, as well as monitor response to treatment using only two items. The study provided two well-interpreted cutoffs of the PHQ-2, with real-world implications for mental health screening in under-resourced settings. Reporting Method: The study adhered to STROBE guidelines. Patient or Public Contribution: No patient or public contribution.

As such, we aimed to identify the greatest barriers emerging adults faced in accessing mental healthcare in Canada, particularly in relation to the Canadian healthcare system which operates on a universal funding model but is challenged by funding shortfalls and a complex relationship to the provinces.MethodsWe systematically examined 28 pieces of literature, including academic and technical literature and publications from government organizations, focused on emerging adults and the Canadian mental healthcare system.ResultsFindings demonstrated that stigma, a lack of mental health knowledge, cost, and interpersonal factors (e.g., ones parental, peer, and romantic supports demonstrating negative views toward mental healthcare may deter treatment; emerging adults demonstrating concerns that accessing mental healthcare may lead to peer rejection) acted as barriers to help-seeking in emerging adults. Additionally, a lack of national institutional cohesion and a lack of policy pertaining to emerging adult healthcare acted as barriers to adequate mental healthcare in this demographic.DiscussionImproving mental health education early in life shows promise at reducing many of the barriers emerging adults face in accessing mental healthcare. Further, policies directed at ensuring a cohesive national mental health system, as well as policies directly designed to care for emerging adult mental health needs, could act as the next steps toward ensuring an accessible and effective Canadian mental healthcare system that can serve as a model for other nations.

AB  - ABSTRACTThe burden mental, neurological, and substance (MNS) disorders in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs)is tremendous, but solutions for addressing the MNS burden remain limited in global adolescent mental healthresearch. The rapid growth and widespread use of technology has the potential to address MNS burden byoffering new solutions for transforming services; however, e-Health has not been systematically studied forpreventive mental health intervention in LMICs. This proposed two-phase R21/R33 study seeks to respond tothe growing burden of adolescent MNS disorders and urgent preventive service needs in LMIC by testingusability, feasibility (R21 phase) and effectiveness (R33 phase) of a mHealth intervention, mHealth Toolkit forScreening & Empowering Lives of Youth (mSELY), to promote adolescent mental health in Kenya. ThemSELY is a preventive intervention tool to be used by adolescents and/or their caregivers as a self-helpsupport modality. The mSELY-A is designed for adolescents and mSELY-P is designed for parents/caregivers.The mSELY integrates 4 key mental health service functions: i) comprehensive screening for adolescentsocial-emotional/mental health and relevant risks (in multiple RDoC domains); ii) a strength and weaknessprofile for an adolescent’s behaviors; iii) tailored mental health literacy and promotion strategies, and iv)tailored referral resources. To promote accessibility and to have broader reach, the mSELY will be embeddedin diverse community based organizations (CBOs) that already provide services to adolescents. In addition, ayouth empowerment approach of task-shifting will be applied to train a team of adolescent-peer-community-health workers (A-CHWs) to support the mSELY implementation. This project is conceptualized within theSocial Action Theory, mHealth/Technology Acceptance Model, and Implementation Outcomes Framework.The specific aims are: (1) to build research and service capacity for digital and public health approaches ofadolescent mental health promotion; (2) to employ a user-centered design to test and enhance usability of themSELY-A and P (in R21 Year 1) and to test feasibility and efficacy of mSELY-A alone, mSELY-P alone, andcombination of mSELY-A + P in youth-served CBOs; (3) to test the effectiveness of the optimized versions ofmSELY-A and P using a cluster-randomized control trial (cRCT); and 4) to disseminate and explore big dataanalytic approaches using the Toolkit data to improve Digital-Toolkit decision support functions and accuracyof mental health precision care.

AB  - In recent years, with the acceleration of urbanization and the implementation of compulsory education, the pressure on students' study and life has increased, and the phenomenon of psychological and behavioral problems has become increasingly prominent. Therefore, the school has regarded students' mental health education as the top priority in teaching work. Effective expression classification can assist psychology researchers to study psychology and other disciplines and analyze children's psychological activities and mental states by classifying expressions, thereby reducing the occurrence of psychological behavior problems. Most of the current mainstream methods focus on the exploration of text explicit features and the optimization of representation models, and few works pay attention to deeper language expressions. Metaphors, as language expressions often used in daily life, are closely related to an individual's emotion, cognition, and psychological state. This paper studies children's smiling face recognition based on deep neural network. In order to obtain a better identification effect of mental health problems of children, this paper attempts to use multisource data, including consumption data, access control data, network logs, and grade data, and proposes a multisource data-based mental health problem identification algorithm. The main research focus is feature extraction, trying to use one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) to mine students' online patterns from online behavior sequences, calculate abnormal scores based on students' consumption data in the cafeteria, and describe the dietary differences among students. At the same time, this paper uses the students' psychological state data provided by the psychological center as a label to improve the deficiencies caused by the questionnaire. This paper uses the training set to train five common classification algorithms, evaluates them through the validation set, and selects the best classifier as our algorithm and uses it to identify students with mental health problems in the test set. The experimental results show that precision reaches 0.68, recall reaches 0.56, and F1-measure reaches 0.67.

T2  - SIMULATION IN HEALTHCARE-JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR SIMULATION IN HEALTHCARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Screen-based simulation is an effective educational strategy that can enhance health care students' engagement with content and critical thinking across various topics, including mental health. To create relevant and realistic simulations, best-practice guidelines recommend the involvement of experts in the development process. We collaborated with persons with lived experience and community partners to cocreate a mental health-focused screen-based simulation. Cocreating meant establishing a nonhierarchical partnership, with shared decision-making from start to finish.In this article, we present 8 principles developed to guide our cocreation with persons with lived experience: person-centeredness, trauma-informed approaches and ethical guidance, supportive environment, two-way partnership, mutual respect, choice and flexibility, open communication, and room to grow. These principles provide practical guidance for educators seeking to engage the expertise of persons who have been historically disadvantaged in society. By sharing these principles, we strive to contribute to a more equitable process in simulation development and promote meaningful, respectful, and safer collaborations.

TI  - An updated systematic review of interventions to increase awareness of mental health and well-being in athletes, coaches, officials and parents
T2  - SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Interventions designed to increase mental health awareness in sport have grown substantially in the last 5 years, meaning that those involved in policy, research and intervention implementation are not fully informed by the latest systematic evaluation of research, risking a disservice to healthcare consumers. Hence, our aim was to update a 2017 systematic review that determined the effect of sport-specific mental health awareness programmes to improve mental health knowledge and help-seeking among sports coaches, athletes and officials. We extended the review to incorporate parents as a source of help-seeking and report the validity of outcome measures and quality of research design that occurred since the original review.Methods: Sport-specific mental health awareness programmes adopting an experimental or quasi-experimental design were included for synthesis. Five electronic databases were searched: Psychinfo, Medline (OVID interface), Scopus, Cochrane and Cinahl. Each database was searched from its year of inception to June 2020. As all of the outcomes measured were derived from psychometric scales, we observed statistically significant quantitative effects on the basis of p < .05, and a small, medium or large effect size as d = .2, .5 or .8, respectively. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane and QATSQ tools.Results: Twenty-eight articles were included from the 2048 retrieved, eighteen additional articles since the original review. Eighteen studies targeted athletes, five with coaches, one sport officials (i.e. referees), one 'at-risk children' and three with parents. One of the studies was a combination of athletes, coaches and parents. In terms of study outcomes, health referral efficacy was improved in seven studies; twelve studies reported an increase in knowledge about mental health disorders. Proportionally, higher quality research designs were evident, as three of ten studies within the previous review did not demonstrate a high risk of bias, whereas thirteen of the eighteen additional studies did not display a high risk of bias. However, only one study included a behaviour change model in both the programme design and evaluation.Conclusions: Our updated systematic review provides evidence of the benefits of mental health awareness interventions in sport; these benefits are mainly for athletes and show improvements in the methodological design of recent studies compared to the first review. There was also evidence of the extension of programme delivery to parents. In conclusion, researchers, practitioners and policy makers should consider methodological guidance and the application of theory when developing and evaluating complex interventions.

TI  - Early intervention for children and young people with neurodevelopmental conditions and intellectual disability: "The Getting Help" offer for Northwest England
T2  - ADVANCES IN AUTISM
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to outline what early support should be offered to children and young people with neurodevelopmental conditions including those who are autistic or have intellectual disability. A review of all child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) services in the Northwest completed by NHS England and Improvement (Doyle and Ryan, 2021) found that there was no clear Tier 2 offer (for mild to moderate mental health issues) for autistic children and young people or for those with intellectual disability. Following this review, a project group that had developed a model for mental health services for autistic children and young people and for those with intellectual disability (Wee et al., 2021) was tasked with articulating the "Getting Help" offer for children and young people with neurodevelopmental conditions, including intellectual disability. Design/methodology/approach - A working group was created consisting of professionals from mental health, education and local authority and lived experience representatives of coproduction partners. A brief review of the background literature was also conducted. Six meetings were held to create a framework for the "Getting Help" offer and to discuss what the offer should be based on professional expertise and lived experience. Findings - Recommendations for the Getting Help multi-agency offer included pre- and post-assessment support as part of a single attention deficit hyperactivity disorder/autism/neurodevelopmental pathway, community support for children with intellectual disability, access to adapted mental health support and the need for early recognition and support for avoidant and restrictive food intake disorder. Key themes from working group discussions included the reduction in the quality of services experienced by children and families due to silo working, which increased the risk of falling between multi-agency services and led to early signs of neurodevelopmental needs, or mental health issues being missed. Another theme was aiming for equity of access and outcomes. Originality/value - This work is a response to a coproduced review of CAMHS in the Northwest and incorporates the lived experience of young people and families. It also adopts a holistic multi-agency neurodevelopmental approach rather than focusing on a single diagnosis or service.

TI  - Interventions reducing barriers to access psychotherapy
T2  - Open Science Framework
M3  - Data set
AB  - Prevalence rates of mental disorders in adolescents, at approximately 17%-50%, are high (Gore et al., 2011; Merikangas et al., 2010), especially for depression with 10-18 % (Busch et al., 2013; Crockett et al., 2020; Kessler et al., 2012). Yet only 23%- 50% use mental health services (Burnett-Zeigler et al., 2012; Essau, 2005; Kessler et al., 2005; Lu, 2020; Lyons et al., 2013). Mental disorders first manifest mostly in childhood and adolescence (Kessler et al., 2005; Merikangas et al., 2010)..Adolescents are therefore an important target group in which to evaluate barriers to professional help seeking, especially because the delay in treatment is longer for early-onset cases of mental disorders than for onset at a later age (Christiana et al., 2000) with an average of 7 to 11 years to the beginning of treatment (Kessler et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2005). Nontreatment leads to chronicity, exacerbation of symptoms, higher impairment of life quality, a lower probability of successfully treating the disorder later, and an increased risk of suicide and self-harm ( Marshall et al., 2005; Merikangas et al., 2010). The estimated likelihood of seeking formal help for personal or emotional problems and suicidal thoughts is relatively low, and adolescents rather prefer informal help sources (Cakar & Savi, 2014; Sawyer et al., 2012; Wilson et al., 2005). Formal help is defined as help from professionals who have a recognized role and appropriate training in providing help and advice, whereas informal help sources (e.g., friends or family) lack a professional background (Rickwood et al., 2009). It has been suggested that young people do not seek formal mental health services because they harbor stigmatizing attitudes toward people with mental disorders, are fearful of seeking help, and have poor mental health knowledge (Aguirre Velasco et al., 2020; Gulliver et al., 2010). Specifically for psychotherapy as a formal help-seeking source, adolescents often report fear because of the unknown setting and procedure as a barrier to access psychotherapy (Pfeiffer & In-Albon, manuscript in preparation). Male adolescents report higher stigmatizing attitudes towards people with mental disorders compared to female adolescents (Chandra & Minkovitz, 2006; Gonzalez et al., 2005; Rickwood et al., 2005), wheras a prior history of help-seeking for mental health problems and familiarity with a person having a mental disorder have a stigma-reducing effect (Calear et al., 2011; Griffiths et al., 2008; Pearl et al., 2016; Pfeiffer & In-Albon, manuscript in preperation). Providing information about mental disorders is one intervention to increase help-seeking behavior, help-seeking intentions, and to enhance positive attitudes towards mental disorders in adolescents (Howard et al., 2019, Rhughani et al., 2011, RIckwood, 2004, Ruble et al., 2013, Salerno et al., 2016). There is evidence that an increase in mental health knowledge is associated with a decrease of self-stigma in the post-evaluation (Young et al., 2013), however, there is a lack of studies evaluating the influence of psychoeducation of psychotherapy and mental disorders towards stigmatizing and self-stigmatizing attitudes using a follow-up evaluation. There is evidence that self-stigma seems to be more resistant to change and more relevant compared to public stigma (Kendra et al., 2014; Nam et al., 2013; Pfeiffer & In-Albon, manscript in preparatoin). Information booklets are a low-cost and easy- accessible intervention to provide information. There is evidence that a booklet for adolescents informing about anxiety disorders and depression increases mental health literacy (Schneider & Borer, 2003; Schiller et al., 2014), but also evidence that they have no significant impact on help-seeking (Sharpe et al., 2016) in a post-assessment. To our knowledge, there is no evaluation regarding the efficacy of a booklet informing about psychotherapy and generalized information about mental disorders, especially with regard to their influence on stigmatizing attitudes. Another medium to increase mental health knowledge are video interventions (Tsoi et al., 2020; Janouskova et al., 2017). Personal contact with people with mental disorders is associated with decreased social distance and lower stigmatizing attitudes (Corrigan et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2013) and remains a gold-standard for anti-stigma interventions (Corrigan et al., 2012; Koller & Stuart, 2016; DeLuca et al., 2020). A video interventions is able to combine education of mental health knowledge and a digital contact with peers sharing their story of having a mental disorder and their way of recovery. Especially with social media, videos in which adolescents communicate about aspects of their mental disorders often provides an easy access to mental health knowledge and a digital contact. Video intervention can equally or sometimes even be more effective in reducing social distance and stigmatizing attitudes than face-to-face interventions (Janouskova et al., 2017). Regarding the evaluation of video interventions there is a lack of evidence: for interventions outside the school setting, where adolescents can watch the video on their own and studies, which looks at long-term outcomes (Janouskva et al., 2017; Salerno, 2016), especially because findings of long term effects of interventions addressing destigmatization and increase of mental health knowledge show mixed results (Aguirre-Velasco et al., , 2020; Schiller et al., 2017).

TI  - Emotional and mental health competences in Spanish textbooks in Primary Education
T2  - REVISTA COMPLUTENSE DE EDUCACION
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: the development of competencies in compulsory education, specifically those concerned with the emotions, constitutes an opportunity to include those learnings considered to be essential. Textbooks are excellent pedagogical material, which give a glimpse of the content which is presented in the classroom. The aim of this work was to evaluate the treatment of the competencies in mental and emotional health in natural science textbooks in Primary Education in Spain. Methodology: the sample was made up of texts for Primary Education from the three publishers with the highest distribution in Spain. A descriptive analysis was carried out of the competency-related contents necessary for the development of the aforementioned competencies. Results: results evidence a predominant presence of informative and preventive contents, followed by those related to personal development. A smaller presence of contents related to the environment and social development was also found. This research has focused on conceptual contents. In this sense, those related to the protection of mental health and to the most frequent problems associated with it, as well as its risk factors, have received special attention. Attitudinal and procedural contents were approached in a much more limited way, despite the fact that some of the texts dealt with empathy, self-esteem, conflict resolution and the ability to communicate and to establish interpersonal relationships. Discussion and conclusions: the absence of contents aimed at promoting stress-management skills, assertiveness and the application of self-control strategies evidenced insufficiencies to develop mental and emotional heath competences. The omission of these contents within the textbooks could potentially represent a limitation for the teacher who uses exclusively these resources. However, given the ultimate goal of this educational area, it should be noted that its health focus stands out positively insofar it goes beyond its biological meaning. It would be advisable to design complementary materials that approach the procedural and attitudinal dimensions required to acquire the cited competences.

TI  - Development and Pilot-Testing of an Optimized Conversational Agent or "Chatbot" for Peruvian Adolescents Living With HIV to Facilitate Mental Health Screening, Education, Self-Help, and Linkage to Care: Protocol for a Mixed Methods, Community-Engaged Study
T2  - JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Adolescents living with HIV are disproportionally affected by depression, which worsens antiretroviral therapy adherence, increases viral load, and doubles the risk of mortality. Because most adolescents living with HIV live in low- and middle -income countries, few receive depression treatment due to a lack of mental health services and specialists in low -resource settings. Chatbot technology, used increasingly in health service delivery, is a promising approach for delivering low -intensity depression care to adolescents living with HIV in resource -constrained settings. Objective: The goal of this study is to develop and pilot -test for the feasibility and acceptability of a prototype, optimized conversational agent (chatbot) to provide mental health education, self-help skills, and care linkage for adolescents living with HIV. Methods: Chatbot development comprises 3 phases conducted over 2 years. In the first phase (year 1), formative research will be conducted to understand the views, opinions, and preferences of up to 48 youths aged 10-19 years (6 focus groups of up to 8 adolescents living with HIV per group), their caregivers (5 in-depth interviews), and HIV program personnel (5 in-depth interviews) regarding depression among adolescents living with HIV. We will also investigate the perceived acceptability of a mental health chatbot, including barriers and facilitators to accessing and using a chatbot for depression care by adolescents living with HIV. In the second phase (year 1), we will iteratively program a chatbot using the SmartBot360 software with successive versions (0.1, 0.2, and 0.3), meeting regularly with a Youth Advisory Board comprised of adolescents living with HIV who will guide and inform the chatbot development and content to arrive at a prototype version (version 1.0) for pilot -testing. In the third phase (year 2), we will pilot -test the prototype chatbot among 50 adolescents living with HIV na & iuml;ve to its development. Participants will interact with the chatbot for up to 2 weeks, and data will be collected on the acceptability of the chatbot-delivered depression education and self-help strategies, depression knowledge changes, and intention to seek care linkage. Results: The study was awarded in April 2022, received institutional review board approval in November 2022, received funding in December 2022, and commenced recruitment in March 2023. By the completion of study phases 1 and 2, we expect our chatbot to incorporate key needs and preferences gathered from focus groups and interviews to develop the chatbot. By the completion of study phase 3, we will have assessed the feasibility and acceptability of the prototype chatbot. Study phase 3 began in April 2024. Final results are expected by January 2025 and published thereafter. Conclusions: The study will produce a prototype mental health chatbot developed with and for adolescents living with HIV that will be ready for efficacy testing in a subsequent, larger study.

TI  - Perceived need and barriers to adolescent mental health care: agreement between adolescents and their parents
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims. Mental disorders cause high burden in adolescents, but adolescents often underutilise potentially beneficial treatments. Perceived need for and barriers to care may influence whether adolescents utilise services and which treatments they receive. Adolescents and parents are stakeholders in adolescent mental health care, but their perceptions regarding need for and barriers to care might differ. Understanding patterns of adolescent-parent agreement might help identify gaps in adolescent mental health care.Methods. A nationally representative sample of Australian adolescents aged 13-17 and their parents (N = 2310), recruited between 2013-2014, were asked about perceived need for four types of adolescent mental health care (counselling, medication, information and skill training) and barriers to care. Perceived need was categorised as fully met, partially met, unmet, or no need. Cohen's kappa was used to assess adolescent-parent agreement. Multinomial logistic regressions were used to model variables associated with patterns of agreement.Results. Almost half (46.5% (S.E. = 1.21)) of either adolescents or parents reported a perceived need for any type of care. For both groups, perceived need was greatest for counselling and lowest for medication. Identified needs were fully met for a third of adolescents. Adolescent-parent agreement on perceived need was fair (kappa = 0.25 (S.E. = 0.01)), but poor regarding the extent to which needs were met (kappa = -0.10 (S.E. = 0.02)). The lack of parental knowledge about adolescents' feelings was positively associated with adolescentparent agreement that needs were partially met or unmet and disagreement about perceived need, compared to agreement that needs were fully met (relative risk ratio (RRR) = 1.91 (95% CI = 1.19-3.04) to RRR = 4.69 (95% CI = 2.38-9.28)). Having a probable disorder was positively associated with adolescent-parent agreement that needs were partially met or unmet (RRR = 2.86 (95% CI = 1.46-5.61)), and negatively with adolescent-parent disagreement on perceived need (RRR = 0.50 (95% CI = 0.30-0.82)). Adolescents reported most frequently attitudinal barriers to care (e.g. self-reliance: 55.1% (S.E. = 2.39)); parents most frequently reported that their child refused help (38.7% (S.E. = 2.69)). Adolescent-parent agreement was poor for attitudinal (kappa = -0.03 (S.E. = 0.06)) and slight for structural barriers (kappa = 0.02 (S.E. = 0.09)).Conclusions. There are gaps in the extent to which adolescent mental health care is meeting the needs of adolescents and their parents. It seems important to align adolescents' and parents' needs at the beginning and throughout treatment and to improve communication between adolescents and their parents. Both might provide opportunities to increase the likelihood that needs will be fully met. Campaigns directed towards adolescents and parents need to address different barriers to care. For adolescents, attitudinal barriers such as stigma and mental health literacy require attention.

TI  - Mobilizing Health Promotion Through Canada's Student Mental Health Network: Concurrent, Mixed Methods Process Evaluation
T2  - JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Mental health issues among Canadian postsecondary students are prevalent. In tandem, an increased acknowledgment of the need for upstream mental health support has been highlighted. While the majority of institutions offer some form of mental health promotion, research suggests students are failing to access support due to barriers including lack awareness, geographical and financial barriers, and lack of relevance in offerings. Canada's Student Mental Health Network is a web-based knowledge mobilization initiative designed to fill these gaps. With content created and curated "for-students, by-students" and reviewed by subject matter experts, the Network serves as a one-stop shop for evidence-based, mental health support for postsecondary students. Objective: The goal of this research was to conduct the first component of a comprehensive program evaluation of the Network. This paper details a formative, process evaluation after approximately 1 year of operations, with the goal of assessing acceptability and feasibility. Methods: Using a concurrent mixed methods study design, quantitative and qualitative data were simultaneously collected from students in order to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of the Network as a mental health promotion resource. Quantitative data were automatically collected through Google Analytics via the website over the course of the first year of operations. Data collected included the number of users accessing the website, user engagement, and user "stickiness." Quantitative data were used to evaluate both accessibility and feasibility. Qualitative data were collected via individual, digital interviews conducted with a modest sample of students (n=8) across areas and levels of study. Qualitative data derived more detailed insights into user experience and website attributes, as well as feedback on content delivery, providing evidence used to evaluate feasibility. Results: A total of 1200 users globally accessed the Network within the first year of operations, with Canadian users accounting for nearly 90% of total website traffic. An overall 66% engagement rate was observed, with the average user visiting 7 pages per session. Further support for the acceptability of the Network is demonstrated in the Canada-wide reach of the content development and review team. Evidence for the feasibility of the Network was observed through website use statistics indicating the most frequently viewed pages aligned with our goals: providing mental health education and increasing awareness of available resources. Qualitative feedback provided additional context surrounding the feasibility of the space, including positive feedback on the esthetics, relevance, usability, inclusion, and accessibility. Areas for content expansion and improvements to accessibility were also identified. Conclusions: The results of this study provide evidence in support of the feasibility and acceptability of the Network a web-based knowledge mobilization initiative in support of postsecondary students' mental health and well-being. Future research will pursue a summative, impact assessment to evaluate utility.

TI  - Climate change and mental health: Position paper of the European Psychiatric Association
T2  - EUROPEAN PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Climate change is one of the greatest threats to health that societies face and can adversely affect mental health. Given the current lack of a European consensus paper on the interplay between climate change and mental health, we signal a need for a pan-European position paper about this topic, written by stakeholders working in mental health care.Methods On behalf of the European Psychiatric Association (EPA), we give recommendations to make mental health care, research, and education more sustainable based on a narrative review of the literature.Results Examples of sustainable mental healthcare comprise preventive strategies, interdisciplinary collaborations, evidence-based patient care, addressing social determinants of mental health, maintaining health services during extreme weather events, optimising use of resources, and sustainable facility management. In mental health research, sustainable strategies include investigating the impact of climate change on mental health, promoting research on climate change interventions, strengthening the evidence base for mental health-care recommendations, evaluating the allocation of research funding, and establishing evidence-based definitions and clinical approaches for emerging issues such as 'eco-distress'. Regarding mental health education, planetary health, which refers to human health and how it is intertwined with ecosystems, may be integrated into educational courses.Conclusions The EPA is committed to combat climate change as the latter poses a threat to the future of mental health care. The current EPA position paper on climate change and mental health may be of interest to a diverse readership of stakeholders, including clinicians, researchers, educators, patients, and policymakers.

TI  - Developing and testing a text-messaging intervention to support parents after their child's psychiatric emergency
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTRates of emergency department (ED) visits for psychiatric emergencies in adolescents have increasedsubstantially in the past decade, including for suicidality, self-harm, and aggression. A substantial number ofthese adolescents will be discharged home from the ED with referrals to outpatient mental health treatment.Yet, engagement in outpatient mental health treatment among adolescents is low, and rates of repeatedemergency services utilization are high, highlighting the need for better supports for these youth and families.While effective, brief interventions have been developed to directly support adolescents at the time of their EDvisit, no evidence-based interventions have been developed to support parents of these youth. Further, theperiod following an emergency visit is known to be high risk, yet no existing services support parents during thetransition home, while waiting for connection to outpatient services. In this intervention development study, weseek to iteratively develop, refine, and test an automated, text-messaging intervention for parents of youthdischarged from the ED after a psychiatric emergency. The 8-week intervention (iPEACE; intervention forparent education after care in the ED) will directly target (1) parent mental health literacy and (2) parent self-efficacy, with the goal of reducing ED utilization and enhancing outpatient mental health service use andengagement. In the first phase of the study, we aim to develop and refine the intervention with stakeholderfeedback. Parents (N=15) will receive the 8-week iPEACE starting immediately following ED discharge.Parents will provide both in-the-moment feedback via text-message surveys and in-depth feedback at the endof the 8-week period via semi-structured qualitative interviews and self-report measures. We will also conductqualitative interviews with enrolled parents’ children and key ED stakeholders. We will use this feedback torefine the intervention materials. In the second phase of the study, we will conduct a pilot randomizedcontrolled trial (N=90), with n=30 parents randomized to enhanced usual care, n=30 randomized to enhancedusual care with text-message reminders, and n=30 randomized to receive iPEACE. Parents will completefollow-up assessments at 4-, 8- and 12-weeks to assess key intervention targets (self-efficacy and mentalhealth literacy) and outcomes (outpatient mental health service utilization and ED utilization). The goals for theproposed project include: (1) developing and refining the iPEACE text-messaging intervention; and (2) pilotingthe iPEACE intervention compared to enhanced usual care only and enhanced usual care with text-messagereminders to assess key study outcomes and mechanisms to inform a fully-power randomized trial. This R34has important clinical implications, as findings from this study may support the testing and implementation of adigital health intervention to improve outcomes for high-risk youth and families. The proposed study has thepotential to inform the provision of clinical services to support families during high-risk clinical transitions.

TI  - The trajectory of caregiver burden and the predictive role of sense of coherence among primary caregivers of colorectal cancer patients: a longitudinal study
T2  - BMC NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundPatients undergoing postoperative chemotherapy for colorectal cancer often have long-term and complex care needs, which places a significant physical and psychological burden on their primary caregivers. Sense of coherence (SOC) may help alleviate this burden by fostering correct perceptions and a positive mindset. This study aimed to analyze the trajectory of caregiver burden and the predictive role of SOC among primary caregivers of CRC patients. MethodsA longitudinal survey was conducted from November 2021 to November 2022 in the oncology departments of three Class A tertiary hospitals in Suzhou. The survey was collected at four time points: before the first chemotherapy, after the first chemotherapy, in the middle of the chemotherapy, and after the last chemotherapy. The Sense of Coherence scale and the Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview were used. Growth Mixture Modeling classified potential trajectories of caregiver burden, and logistic regression assessed the influence of SOC on these. Results204 primary caregivers of CRC patients completed the survey. The overall caregiver burden showed an initial increase and subsequent decrease, being most severe at T2 and least severe at T4. Caregiver burden trajectories were categorized into low and high caregiving burden groups (P < 0.01). SOC was moderate (65.52 +/- 14.75) and was negatively associated with the trajectory of caregiver burden (OR = 0.955, 95% CI: 0.927-0.985). Factors significantly linked to the high-burden group included having one child, low education, being the patient's child, having other family members to care for, lacking alternative caregivers, and caregiving >= 12 h daily (all P < 0.01). ConclusionA lower SOC can exacerbate the primary caregiver burden. Healthcare professionals should pay special attention to primary caregivers who have low education, have one child, are the children of patients, are responsible for caring for other family members, and lack alternative caregivers. Timely interventions should be initiated to provide appropriate support, such as mental health education, SOC training, cognitive therapy, and other interventions. These efforts aim to enhance SOC levels and reduce the caregiver burden, thereby promoting the overall well-being of primary caregivers. Clinical trial numberNot applicable.

TI  - Progression of externalizing disorders into anxiety disorders: Longitudinal transitions in the first three decades of life
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANXIETY DISORDERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: There is a notable comorbidity between externalizing disorders and anxiety disorders, which may be explained by the co-occurrence of two prevalent early-onset disorders, by shared vulnerability and risk factors, or as evidence that one disorder group might be causally related to the other. Aim: To investigate the longitudinal trajectories of externalizing disorders, their interplay with anxiety disorders, and putative predictors for symptom progression in youth. Methods: 1053 adolescents (14-17 years) from the general population were assessed at baseline and prospectively at 2, 4, and 10-year follow-up using a standardized interview of mental disorders (DIA-X/M-CIDI) to assess "early" (oppositional-defiant disorder, conduct disorder, ADHD) and "late" (antisocial behavior, substance use disorders) externalizing disorders as well as anxiety disorders. Longitudinal associations and predictors for symptom progression were examined using Kaplan-Meier-analyses. Results: Lifetime prevalence of early externalizing disorders were 9.1% and 6.4% among those with and without any anxiety disorder. A late externalizing disorder was reported by 50.3% of those with an early externalizing disorder and in 26.6% of those with any anxiety disorder. Both early (HR: 1.5, 95%CI: 1.0-2.3) and late externalizing disorders (HR: 2.1, 95%CI: 1.7-2.6) were associated with incident anxiety disorders. Higher parental rejection, lower volitional inhibition, and higher volitional avoidance predicted incident anxiety disorders among those with early externalizing disorders. Discussion: Early externalizing disorders likely follow a homotypic continuity (to late externalizing disorders) and/or a heterotypic continuity to anxiety disorders, and thus appear as a useful target for prevention and early intervention.

TI  - Global burden and prediction study of schizophrenia 1990-2030: comparison with China
T2  - BMC PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveThis study aims to assess and predict global and Chinese schizophrenia burden trends from 1990 to 2030.MethodsRetrieve data from the 2021 Global Burden of Disease Study to estimate the incidence, prevalence, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of schizophrenia from 1990 to 2021. Establish a joint point analysis and Bayesian age-period-cohort (BAPC) model to predict the burden of schizophrenia in 2030.ResultIn 2021, the global prevalence of schizophrenia was approximately 13.60 million cases, with an age-standardized rate of 275.78 per 100,000 population. The global incidence was around 1.2 0million cases, with a rate of 15.43 per 100,000, and the global DALYs totaled 14.80 million, with a rate of 177.75 per 100,000. In China, the prevalence was about 5.30 million cases (300.81 per 100,000), the incidence was 236,175 cases (18.36 per 100,000), and DALYs were 3.40 million (203.88 per 100,000). From 1990 to 2021, China's age-standardized prevalence and DALY rates increased, with estimated annual percentage change (EAPCs) of 0.12 and 0.04. However, the global age-standardized incidence rate also decreased, with an EAPC of -0.04. Using the BAPC model, forecasts indicate a rising trend in both global and Chinese schizophrenia prevalence, incidence, and DALYs from 2020 to 2030. By 2030, the global age-standardized prevalence, incidence, and DALYs are projected to reach 280.36, 15.59, and 177.31 per 100,000, respectively. In China, these rates are expected to reach 332.58, 19.87, and 216.67 per 100,000.ConclusionThe global burden of schizophrenia is increasing, particularly in China, where the trend is especially pronounced. In response to this trend, Mental health education and early identification measures should be promoted for high-burden populations, especially young adults aged 20-34, while mental health support services for men should be strengthened and more gender-sensitive treatment and rehabilitation pathways should be designed. As future burden projections continue to rise, policymakers should optimize resource allocation, accordingly, incorporate research data into mental health planning, and improve accessibility and equity of services for key populations, in order to promote more targeted intervention strategies and effectively alleviate the social and family burden of schizophrenia.

TI  - Reciprocal relationship between interpersonal communication and depressive symptoms and the mediating role of resilience across two years: Three-wave cross-lagged panel model
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Depression among children has been a growing public health concern. It is generally recognized that individuals with depression are likely to have interpersonal malfunctioning. However, there remains a limited scientific understanding of the reciprocal relationship between interpersonal communication and depressive symptoms among rural Chinese children in a longitudinal approach. Methods: Therefore, guided by the interpersonal model of depression and the developmental cascade model, the present study conducted a cross-lagged panel analysis study to explore the bidirectional relationship between interpersonal communication and depressive symptoms across three waves among 2188 elementary school students in rural areas of one county of Gansu Province, China. We also examined the mediating effect of resilience and sex differences of the models.Results: Our results showed that depressive symptoms negatively predicted interpersonal communication from T1 to T2 and T2 to T3. Interpersonal communication negatively predicted depressive symptoms from T1 to T2, but not T2 to T3. Furthermore, resilience showed significant partial mediating effects in the reciprocal relationship between interpersonal communication and depressive symptoms. In terms of sex differences, the significant relationship between depressive symptoms at T1 and interpersonal communication at T2 was found to be sig-nificant among male students and marginally significant among female students. The full mediating effect of resilience at T1 was found only among male students, whereas resilience at T2 functioned as a full mediator between depressive symptoms at T2 and interpersonal communication at T3 only among female students. Limitations: First, the present sample consisted of only third and fourth grade (i.e., in T1) students from one county in rural China. Second, the present study examined depressive symptoms instead of depression as a clinical diagnosis. Third, the third wave of the data was collected during COVID-19. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could unexpectedly pose on child mental health.Conclusions: The finding underlined the importance of providing comprehensive depression prevention and intervention from fostering children's inner resilience and promoting their ability to navigate interpersonal resources.

TI  - The latent category of resilience and its relationship with the mental health and coping styles of medical students
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundMedical students suffer more pressure due to various reasons and their mental health problems get more attention. Resilience is a positive psychological perspective to explore the medical students' mental health and coping style problems. This study focuses on the medical students in school and uses the method of latent category analysis (LCA) to analyze the classification characteristics of their resilience. Therefore, the study aims to help psychological educators in medical colleges to develop positive mental health education strategies for medical students. ObjectiveTo explore the potential categories of resilience of medical students and the relationship between these categories and mental health and coping style. MethodsA total of 1,457 medical students from four medical colleges in Anhui Province were selected as the research subjects by a convenience sampling method. A general information questionnaire, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), Kessler 10 and the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ) were used to investigate; SPSS 25.0 and Mplus 7 software were used for basic analysis and latent category exploration. Expected resultsThe medical students were divided into three potential categories of mental resilience: the low resilience group, moderate resilience self-improvement group and high resilience tough group. The optimism dimension level of the three categories was low. There were statistically significant differences in the distribution of resilience among medical students, such as gender, source of students, and paternal and maternal education level. There were significant differences in the mental health, positive coping style and negative coping style scores among the three categories. Female medical students with low parental education levels have a lower level of resilience. Logistic regression analysis showed that a lower maternal education level was a risk factor for resilience level, and a high positive coping style score and gender were protective factors for resilience level. DiscussionThere are group differences in the resilience of medical students, which suggests that school health workers should formulate targeted intervention programs for different types of students to improve their resilience and mental health, and further more, this study reminds mental health workers in colleges and universities to pay more attention to the mental health status of female medical students whose parents are less educated.

TI  - Innovative approaches to developing scalable and sustainable adolescent maternal mental health interventions in Kenya and Mozambique
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - The majority of the 20,000 babies born to adolescent mothers in low and middle-income countries live in sub-Saharan Africa. Efforts to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals have focused on preventing teenage pregnancy, leaving adolescent mothers with limited support to overcome the specific challenges they face. Adolescent girls are particularly vulnerable with 1 in 2 experiencing a mental disorder during pregnancy or the year after birth. The adverse effects on their physical health, social networks, educational achievements and employment opportunities and well as the developmental, emotional, behavioural and physical health outcomes of their children are significant. Despite this inequity, no interventions focused on adolescent maternal mental health have been evaluated in these low-resource settings. This is the challenge this Fellowship will address.  To support adolescent mothers and their children to survive and thrive, it is necessary to engage stakeholders in the development of mental health interventions and identify how to leverage the surrounding structures and forces to optimise interventions for both front-line use and local and national implementation through the combination of human-centred design and systems thinking approaches. Through this fellowship I will use human-centred, systems-minded design to partner with adolescent girls, their families, and health providers to design, implement, and evaluate interventions to improve the mental health of adolescents during pregnancy and the year after birth in Mozambique and Kenya.  A seven-year, three-phase, mixed-method design will be used to develop and evaluate a mental health prevention intervention for pregnant and new mothers aged 15-19 living in Mozambique and Kenya. In Phase 1 (months 2-18) a human-centred, system-minded design approach will be used to partner with adolescents, their families, local service providers and policymakers to identify, adapt and prototype an intervention to improve adolescent maternal mental health outcomes in each country. In Phase 2 (months 14-48), the intervention will be piloted within each country to assess feasibility, appropriateness, and acceptability and collect mental health, process and resource data to prepare for a trial. Lastly, in Phase 3 (months 49-84), a randomised controlled trial evaluating clinical effectiveness and delivery outcomes compared to usual care/basic mental health literacy intervention will be conducted.   The research will result in the development of an intervention(s) that supports adolescent maternal wellbeing and gives adolescent mothers the hope and skills to build a better life for them and their children by packaging what we know are the risk and protective factors for maternal mental disorders in a way that is attractive to young mothers, their families and service providers. By using human-centred, systems-minded design to understand the needs and priorities of young mothers and the health and community systems in which they live, the resulting intervention(s) and approach to contextual adaptation has significant potential for international transferability and impact beyond Mozambique and Kenya, and beyond Africa. In addition, the work undertaken will provide a foundation for the development of approaches to adaptation and implementation of mental health interventions which can be used by providers of mental health interventions across the lifespan.

TI  - Wellbeing Literacy: Conceptualization, Measurement, and Preliminary Empirical Findings from Students, Parents and School Staff
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims: Wellbeing literacy is the intentional use of wellbeing relevant vocabulary, knowledge and language skills to maintain or improve the wellbeing of oneself, others and the world. In this study, we operationalize the human aspects of the concept of wellbeing literacy and empirically test its relationship with wellbeing and illbeing. We also assess its incremental variance in wellbeing and illbeing, after controlling for existing and well-established predictors of these constructs within education settings. Methods: We developed and empirically tested the Wellbeing literacy 6-item (Well-Lit 6) scale to assess the concept of wellbeing literacy in the education context. The scale was developed based on a working definition of wellbeing literacy, in combination with the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority (ACARA)'s definition of literacy. The Well-Lit 6 was administered via a cross-sectional survey to three Australian samples that comprise different elements of Australian education systems: students (N = 1392), parents (N = 584) and school staff (N = 317). Results: Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) suggested the six items of the Well-Lit 6 form an independent construct, empirically distinguishable from other wellbeing-related constructs (e.g., general wellbeing, resilience, and emotion regulation). Convergent analyses showed wellbeing literacy was positively related to wellbeing and negatively related to illbeing. Incremental validity analyses showed wellbeing literacy predicted variance in wellbeing and illbeing after controlling for participant demographics, resilience, and emotion regulation, showing initial evidence of incremental validity. Conclusions: Our results provide preliminary evidence that wellbeing literacy is a distinct construct from wellbeing and illbeing, and it also demonstrates significant unique variance in these constructs over and above resilience and emotion regulation. The Well-Lit 6 is a useful provisional measure of wellbeing literacy, although we suggest a fruitful avenue for future research is to develop a more comprehensive scale of wellbeing literacy that denotes specific facets of communication, allowing a fuller exploration wellbeing literacy, its components, and their antecedents and consequences. We offer further recommendations for future research and discuss limitations with our approach.

The HSPU provides an informed consent training, required for all NIMH investigators who obtain consent.  OHSRP also requires this training per Policy 301 for post-doc IRTAs/fellows in all institutes.  2140 NIH staff and trainees have attended part 1 of this training.  Part 2 of the training is the observed "Objective Structured Clinical Exam for the Evaluation of the Informed Consent Process (OSCE)" which evaluates three domains: professionalism, interpersonal communication and the general requirements for informed consent.  HSPU has administered 86 OSCE informed consents in the last two years. The HSPU NIMH Toolkit for Human Subjects Protections: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/hspu assists other research organizations to assess, develop and implement appropriate levels of human subjects protections at their own facilities. SCIENTIFIC REVIEW: The Committee for Scientific Review of Protocols (CSRP) reviews all new clinical protocols. Four new protocols were approved in 2023, with 4 in process. A subcommittee conducts annual review of ongoing protocols. In FY23 the CSRP and the Data Management and Sharing (DMS) Committee reviewed and approved DMS plans for all active clinical protocols and all basic lab and branch chiefs.REGULATORY OVERSIGHT: The Office for Regulatory Oversight (ORO) focuses on compliance with regulatory requirements and Good Clinical Practice (GCP). The NIMH Clinical Director now serves as the IND (13 active INDs for 25 protocols, 3 IDEs and 1 IND on full clinical hold) sponsor with support from the Office of Research Support and Compliance (ORSC) via quarterly meetings. The ORO coordinates the scientific review of new and ongoing protocols and provides protocol navigation services to investigators for 83 active clinical protocols during a massive transition of the NIH protocol management systems to Protect and Protrak. The navigation team provides direct support to investigators in all aspects of IRB submissions and tracking of investigator trainings. The OCD and SD have reviewed and approved data sharing plans for intramural studies in accordance with NIH policy. The OCD coordinates a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) to oversee NIMH IRP protocols. Two clinical monitors develop and implement individualized monitoring plans for all active NIMH IRP protocols to assure GCP compliance, providing training and corrective action plans as needed.TRAINING AND EDUCATION: The NIMH OCD works in partnership with the NIMH Office of Fellowship Training (OFT) and the Office of Clinical Research and Training in Medical Education (OCRTME) to oversee and participate in several programs that train and educate new physicians, medical students, and psychology practicum students from diverse backgrounds.

M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - BRAINedu: A Window into the Brain/Una Ventana al Cerebro Project Abstract – Twin Cities PBSBRAINedu: A Window into the Brain/Una Ventana al Cerebro is a national Spanish/English informaleducation project providing culturally competent programming and media resources about the brain’sstructure and function to Hispanic middle school students and their families. The project responds to theneed to eliminate proven barriers to Hispanic students’ STEM/neuroscience education, increase Hispanicparticipation in neuroscience and mental health careers and increase Hispanic utilization of mental healthresources. The program’s goals are to engage Hispanic learners and families by 1) empowering informalSTEM educators to provide culturally competent activities about the brain’s structure and function; 2)demonstrating neuroscience and mental health career options; and 3) reducing mental health stigma, thusincreasing help-seeking behavior. The hypothesis underpinning BRAINedu’s four-year project plan is thatparticipating Hispanic youth and families will be able to explain how the brain works and describespecific brain disorders; demonstrate a higher level of interest of neuroscience and mental health careersand be more willing to openly discuss and seek support for brain disorders and mental health conditions.To achieve program goals, Twin Cities PBS (TPT) will leverage existing partnerships with Hispanic-serving youth educational organizations to provide culturally competent learning opportunities aboutbrain health to Hispanic students and families. TPT will partner with neuroscience and mental healthprofessionals, cultural competency experts and Hispanic-serving informal STEM educators to completethe following objectives: 1) Develop bilingual educational resources for multigenerational audiences; 2)Provide professional development around neuroscience education to informal educators, empoweringthem to implement programming with Hispanic youth and families, and 3) Develop role model videoprofiles of Hispanic neuroscience professionals, and help partner organizations produce autobiographicalstudent videos.We will employ rigorous evaluation strategies to measure the project’s impact on Hispanic participants’:a) understanding of neuroscience and brain health, particularly around disorders that disproportionatelyaffect the Hispanic community; b) motivation to pursue neuroscience or mental health career paths; and c)mental health literacy and help-seeking behavior. The project will directly reach 72 Hispanic-servinginformal STEM educators and public health professionals, and 200 children and 400 parents inunderserved urban, suburban and rural communities nationwide.

TI  - COVID-19 and mental health services in Sub-Saharan Africa: A critical literature review
T2  - COMPREHENSIVE PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has wrought a profound impact on mental health in Sub- Saharan Africa, exacerbating existing disparities and rendering individuals undergoing treatment particularly susceptible. This comprehensive critical review delves into the scope, nature, and extent of COVID-19 impact on mental health services in Sub- Saharan Africa, while concurrently elucidating pivotal lessons and exemplary practices learnt from periods of lockdown. Methods: The methodology was guided by Jesson & Laccy's guide on how to conduct critical literature reviews. Articles were comprehensively sought through two academic databases (PubMed and Google Scholar), complemented by targeted searches on the WHO website and official public health websites of relevant Sub-Saharan African countries. Results: The investigation reveals a surge in mental health challenges, notably marked by a significant escalation in anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Disruptions to care services, financial hardships, and the pervasive effects of social isolation further compound this escalation. The pre-existing inequalities in access to and quality of care were accentuated during this crisis, with marginalized groups encountering heightened impediments to essential services. In navigating this unprecedented challenge, communities emerged as integral agents in establishing supportive networks and implementing culturally sensitive interventions. Technology, such as telemedicine and online resources, played a pivotal role in bridging access gaps, particularly in remote areas. The synthesis of best practices for supporting mental health patients during lockdowns encompasses targeted interventions for vulnerable groups, including adolescents and pregnant women. Empowering communities through economic support and mental health literacy programs was identified as crucial. The integration of technology, such as the development of robust telemedicine frameworks, virtual training in curricula, and the utilization of digital platforms for interventions and public messaging, emerged as a cornerstone in addressing access disparities. Community engagement and resilience-building strategies gained prominence, emphasizing the necessity of collaboration between healthcare providers and communities. Promotion of peer support groups, home-based care, and the preservation of traditional healing practices were underscored as essential components. Conclusion: The study underscores the need to adapt and optimize mental health services during emergencies. This entails prioritizing mental health within emergency response frameworks, exploring alternative service delivery methods, and fortifying data collection and research efforts.

TI  - The relationship between social support and smartphone addiction: the mediating role of negative emotions and self-control
T2  - BMC PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundWith the rapid development of the internet, smartphones have become an indispensable part of our lives. However, prolonged, excessive and uncontrolled use may lead to the hidden danger of smartphone addiction, posing a threat to users' physical and mental health. Previous studies have shown that social support may be a factor in alleviating smartphone addiction. However, its specific mechanism needs further exploration. The purpose of this study is to examine the chain mediating effects of negative emotions and self-control on the relationship between social support and smartphone addiction. MethodsA cross-sectional survey was conducted from January 2022 to April 2023 in Sichuan Province, China, with 5,188 respondents aged 15 years or older. Spearman's correlation analysis was used to determine correlations between social support, negative emotions, self-control, and smartphone addiction. We construct a Structural Equation Model (SEM) to explore the pathways of smartphone addiction across different age groups. ResultsSocial support, negative emotions, self-control, and smartphone addiction were found to be significantly related (p < 0.01).In the population aged 15-44, a complete SEM pathway analysis was achieved, while for the population aged 45-64, a simplified version of the pathway analysis was obtained. Among the population aged 65 and above, multiple pathways were found to be nonsignificant. For the full sample, social support not only exhibited a negative correlation with smartphone addiction (beta = -0.410; 95% CI: -0.534 to -0.320) but also influenced smartphone addiction through three specific pathways: via negative emotions (beta = -0.041; 95% CI: -0.066 to -0.021), via self-control (beta = -0.087; 95% CI: -0.119 to -0.063), and via a sequential effect of negative emotions and self-control (beta = -0.047; 95% CI: -0.062 to -0.036). The 15-44 age group demonstrated similar pathways to the full sample, whereas the 45-64 age group lost the pathway mediated solely by negative emotions. ConclusionsOur study shows that high social support reduces smartphone addiction by diminishing negative emotions and improving self-control.The effect is more pronounced in the 15-44 age group.We suggest strengthening the social support system through more activities and urge relevant departments to improve the mental health education, enhance self-control training, and promote mental well-being to help avoid smartphone addiction.

TI  - Recent Developments in Community-Based Mental Health Care in Japan: A Narrative Review.
T2  - Consortium psychiatricum
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since the 1950s, mental health care in Japan has been hospital-centered. A set of legislative initiatives were undertaken in 1995, emphasizing the importance of community-based mental health care. However, despite these attempts to develop a community-based mental health care system, the rate of inpatient-based treatment has remained high and the shift from hospital-centered care to community-based has still not fully materialized.AIM: This study aims to conduct a review of the available literature on the development of community-based mental health care in Japan between 2010 and 2020.METHODS: We conducted a standardized literature search in the electronic database Igaku Chuo Zasshi, aiming to identify original studies published between 2010 and 2020 that explored community mental health care in Japan. The included studies' outcomes were categorized as performance surveys, service user reports, service provider reports, and educational activities. A descriptive-analytical method was implemented in the current review.RESULTS: A total of 25 studies were examined. Six studies reported surveys assessing the performance of community-based mental health care on the assertive community treatment (ACT), compulsory treatment, home-visit nursing care, physical complications, and a welfare medicine collaboration on a remote islands. Four studies investigated the perspectives of service users or their families on home-visit nursing care, social participation, community program, and legislative revision. Ten studies focused on social withdrawal, service providers perspectives on local population needs, supporting skills, care programs, and the professional growth of psychiatric social workers. Five studies focused on educational approaches for future healthcare professionals and efforts to improve mental health literacy among adolescents.CONCLUSION: This paper provided the first comprehensive review of Japan's community-based mental health care. Between 2010 and 2020, community mental health care in Japan evolved in many directions, with the understanding that various needs should be met. Home-visit nursing care and ACT can be considered as the most thoroughly investigated and better developed. Research that adopt rigorous methodologies such as randomized controlled trials is required if the goal is to achieve solid conclusions.
AB  - ВВЕДЕНИЕ: С 1950-х годов психиатрическая помощь в Японии была главным образом сосредоточена в стационарах. В 1995 г. в законодательство был внесен ряд изменений, которые подчеркнули важность амбулаторной психиатрической помощи. Однако, несмотря на попытки развития системы амбулаторной психиатрической помощи, уровень стационарного лечения остается высоким, а переход от больничного лечения к амбулаторному так и не осуществился в полной мере.ЦЕЛЬ: Целью данного исследования является обзор доступной литературы, посвященной развитию амбулаторной психиатрической помощи в Японии в период с 2010 по 2020 гг.МЕТОДЫ: Мы провели стандартизированный литературный поиск в электронной базе данных Igaku Chuo Zasshi с целью найти оригинальные исследования об амбулаторной психиатрической помощи в Японии, опубликованные в период с 2010 по 2020 гг. Результаты выбранных исследований были классифицированы как опросы эффективности, отчеты пользователей услуг, отчеты поставщиков услуг и образовательные мероприятия. В настоящем обзоре использован описательно-аналитический метод.РЕЗУЛЬТАТЫ: Всего включено 25 исследований. В шести исследованиях сообщалось об опросах, оценивающих эффективность амбулаторной психиатрической помощи в проведении ассертивной амбулаторной терапии, принудительного лечения, сестринского ухода на дому, соматических осложнений и социально-медицинском сотрудничестве на отдаленных островах. В четырех исследованиях изучали представления потребителей услуг или их семей о сестринском уходе на дому, социализацию, общественные программы и изменения в законодательстве. Десять исследований были посвящены социальному отчуждению, представлениям поставщиков услуг о потребностях населения, навыкам обслуживания, программам ухода и профессиональному росту психиатрических социальных работников. Пять исследований были посвящены подходам к обучению будущих медицинских работников и мерам по повышению грамотности подростков в вопросах психического здоровья..ЗАКЛЮЧЕНИЕ: В данной статье представлен первый всеобъемлющий обзор амбулаторной психиатрической помощи в Японии. В период с 2010 по 2020 гг. в Японии наблюдалось развитие амбулаторной психиатрической помощи во многих областях благодаря растущему пониманию необходимости удовлетворения существующей потребности. Наиболее изученными и разработанными видами помощи можно считать сестринский уход на дому и ассертивную амбулаторную терапию (AАT). Исследования, в которых используется строгая методология, такая как рандомизированные контролируемые испытания, необходимы, если целью является получение надежных выводов.

TI  - Implementation of family-based treatment for Asian adolescents with anorexia nervosa: A consecutive cohort examination of outcomes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EATING DISORDERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective This study describes the implementation of family-based treatment (FBT) in an eating disorder program in Asia as well as clinical outcomes of Asian adolescents with anorexia nervosa (AN) treated with FBT.Method This retrospective consecutive cohort study of 147 Asian adolescents with AN was compared between those in FBT (n = 65) versus treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 82). Variables associated with weight restoration were analyzed between groups.Results Participants' mean age was 14.2 (SD = 1.5) years and 93% were female. Mean presenting %mBMI was 74.0 (SD = 7.8) and average illness duration was 7.7 (SD = 6.1) months. The two groups' baseline characteristics were not significantly different. Weight restoration rates in the FBT group were significantly higher than the TAU group at 6-, 12-, and 24-month time points. A linear mixed model showed the mean %mBMI was significantly higher at 0, 6, 12, and 24 months in the FBT group. The median time to weight restoration for patients on FBT was shorter (FBT: 7.0 months, TAU: 19.0 months; 95% CI [14.5, 23.5] chi(2) = 15.84, p < .001). Within the FBT group, those that completed >= 9 FBT sessions had significantly higher rates of weight restoration at 12 months. Across all participants, those with a lower starting %mBMI were less likely to achieve weight restoration by 12 months.Conclusion FBT can be effectively implemented in a multidisciplinary eating disorder program managing Asian adolescents with AN with improved rates of weight restoration. Further research is needed to understand the predictors and moderators of remission using FBT in Asian adolescents with AN.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The freshmen stage is a high incidence period for psychological issues. With the increasing gap between urban and rural areas in China, the mental problems of rural freshmen are more prominent in recent years due to the huge contrast of campus life with their growth environment and other reasons. The concern for the mental well-being of both rural and urban freshman students prompted our comprehensive five-year study (2018-2022) on psychological issues in a group of 12,564 first-year students from dozens of public universities in Shandong province. The investigation employed PPS (probability proportional to size) sampling and was conducted near the the end of the first semester. Using the data gathered, we analyzed and compared the indicators of psychological problems in rural and urban freshmen by Duncan's Multiple Range Test. We also conducted a canonical correlation analysis and pathway analysis to examine the psychological factors that contribute to anxiety and depression in both rural and urban freshmen. According to the findings, rural freshmen exhibit significantly higher levels of anxiety and depression than their urban counterparts. Inferiority, obsession, and internet addiction were identified as the primary influencing factors of anxiety and depression in both rural and urban freshmen. Social phobia was found to be a significant influencing factor for anxiety in rural freshmen, while bigotry was identified as a specific influencing factor for urban freshmen. Furthermore, the results of the path analysis suggest that anxiety plays a crucial role as a mediating factor between the main influencing factors and depression. These results substantially extend former research in this area and have important implications for the development of effective intervention strategies to address anxiety and depression. According to these results, policymakers should assess and intervene of anxiety and depression as a whole, and provide mental health education according to main effect factors of freshmen from rural and urban areas. Detailed policy recommendations are in discussion and conclusion.

TI  - Developing a Digital Intervention for Adolescent Nonsuicidal Self-injury
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) affects an estimated 17% of adolescents worldwide. Earlier onset inadolescence is linked to more severe trajectories of NSSI, suicide plans, and poorer quality of life. Thoughearly intervention for NSSI is critical, most adolescents with NSSI do not seek professional help, and many donot self-disclose their behaviors to anyone in person, limiting access to support and preventing pathways totreatment. While several psychological interventions have been effective in reducing adolescent NSSI,structural barriers (e.g., time, cost), attitudinal barriers (e.g., stigma, mental health literacy), and the prevalenceof non-disclosure constrain their accessibility and reach. Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) present anopportunity to reach this high-risk and non-treatment-engaged population and increase their access toevidence-based psychological strategies. Indeed, adolescents report receptivity to digital interventions andengage in NSSI help-seeking online at high rates. However, to date there are no publicly available DMHIsdesigned to support this adolescent population. In collaboration with Mental Health America (MHA), thenation's largest mental health advocacy organization, the proposed K01 application will address this gap bydesigning and evaluating a DMHI attuned to the unique needs and preferences of adolescents (14-17 years)who engage in NSSI. This project will leverage a moment of online information-seeking through MHA'swebsite, to deliver a low-intensity DMHI focused on acquisition and practice of evidence-based skills toimprove self-regulation and deliver help-seeking information, to ultimately reduce NSSI frequency andencourage future treatment engagement. Partnering with MHA to deliver the DMHI provides a cleardissemination pathway and access to a diverse group of adolescents who are not in treatment. To design theDMHI, I will employ user-centered design activities, which involve key stakeholders in the research and designprocess to ensure adolescents' needs and preferences are reflected in the final DMHI. I will also engage MHAstakeholders in the development of a strategic implementation and dissemination plan through their website. Iwill then pilot a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the DMHI with 80 adolescents (14-17 years of age)randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive the DMHI (n=40) or an active psychoeducational control (n=40) for theduration of 8 weeks. This K01 will be a critical first step in positioning me to achieve my career goal andbecome a leading independent researcher in digital mental health. My four training aims are designed tosupport this overarching goal by extending my expertise in: 1) UCD and summative methods including usabilitytesting for DMHIs and support further development of expertise in 2) the conduct of clinical trials, 3) scalableimplementation methodologies, and 4) treatment models for adolescent NSSI. Accomplishment of thesetraining goals and the proposed research project will provide the skills necessary for the development of anR01 of a fully powered hybrid implementation-effectiveness trial testing the efficacy of the DMHI.

TI  - Lay beliefs about the causes and treatment of depression: Tests of measurement models and associations
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: There is reason to expect beliefs about depression's causes and treatment to influence use of psychotherapy, but the literature is marked by theoretical, methodological, and empirical inconsistencies. This study assessed the factorial validity of measures of beliefs about depression's causes and formal treatment versus selfmanagement. It also tested the links of causal attributions to general treatment/self-management beliefs and endorsement of specific interventions. Methods: The revised Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ-R) adapted for depression was administered online to a non-patient, U.S. sample (N = 319). Results: Confirmatory factor analyses yielded three causal dimensions, Environmental Stressors, Biological Factors, and Personal Attributes, and two control dimensions, (Formal) Treatment and Personal. Both models fit irrespective of whether respondents believed they had ever experienced depression. A structural equation model (SEM) showed a positive relationship for Environmental and Biological attributions, and an inverse relationship for Personal attributions, in predicting general preferences for Formal Treatment. A second SEM, focusing on specific interventions, linked Environmental causation to endorsement of psychotherapy, dietary changes, and self-help, and Biological causation to endorsement of medication and exercise, with Personal causation inversely associated with endorsement of psychotherapy. Limitations: A cross-sectional, correlational design precludes causal inferences. Potential sociocultural influences were not assessed. Conclusions: Modifications to the IPQ-R suggested by this study improved its psychometric properties, validated its distinction between Treatment and Personal Control beliefs, and supported examination of both general and specific beliefs about ways to deal with depression. Relationships linking cause and treatment beliefs warrant further investigation as potential intervention targets to increase treatment utilization.

M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Project Summary/AbstractThe objective of this proposal is to develop and pilot a systems-level strategy in pediatricprimary care to enhance identification and management of suicidal ideation and behavior inLatinx youth, particularly those in immigrant families with parents who have limited Englishproficiency (LEP). We will focus on the use of trained community health workers (CHWs) toincrease clinic capacity and quality of suicide risk screening and early intervention, with a focuson safety planning, parent psychoeducation and care coordination. Our specific aims are 1: Todevelop site-specific implementation protocols for the integration of CHWs into SIB screeningand safety planning for Latinx youth and their families; 2: To pilot the implementation of theprogram in a six-month open trial in four pediatric primary care practices representing a range ofusual practice settings; and 3: To engage a stakeholder network to explore barriers andfacilitators, including costs and billing strategies, to implementation of this approach across abroad range of pediatric primary care settings. In Aim 1, we will use Implementation Mapping, asystematic process incorporating the perspectives of users (e.g., families), implementers (e.g.,clinic staff), adopters (e.g. clinic administrators) and sustainers (e.g. healthcare service deliveryexperts and payors) to guide development of strategies to adopt, implement and maintain anevidence-based intervention in the four participating pediatric practices. In Aim 2, we will assessfeasibility, acceptability, and impact on organizational (e.g., increase in screening and CHWreferral, engagement in follow-up mental health visits) and patient-level outcomes (e.g.,improved family functioning, parenting self-efficacy). Quantitative data (e.g., changes in rates ofscreening) will be examined using an interrupted time series analysis. In Aim 3, we will conductsemi-structured interviews with stakeholders and convene the stakeholder network to developan implementation plan for a larger trial. We will then integrate pilot trial and qualitative datausing mixed methods analysis to assess feasibility and acceptability at the organizational,provider, and patient levels and convene to develop an implementation plan for a larger trial.Successful completion of this deployment-focused pilot study would prepare us fora future multi-site cluster randomized controlled trial assessing the effectiveness of theimplementation of suicide prevention interventions delivered by CHWs in health care settings onrates of suicidal ideation and behavior for Latinx youth in pediatric primary care, with the long-term goal of addressing mental health service disparities and preventing youth suicide.

TI  - Examining the relationship between parents' endorsed gender norms and their early adolescents' psychosocial health educational engagement, and nutrition in the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Project SummaryEarly adolescence, the time between 10 and 14 years of age, is an important developmental period. Parentsretain crucial influence over the physical, emotional, and cognitive development of their early adolescents byproviding for their material well-being and through role modeling, monitoring, and socialization. As such,gender norms endorsed by parents strongly influence what adolescents believe to be the socially acceptablesets of behaviors for boys and girls. Gender inequitable constructs resulting from restrictive gender norms arepassed down intergenerationally from parents to their children, and also directly affect the mental and physicalhealth of both girls and boys. In low- and middle-income countries both sexes are negatively impacted byinequitable gender attitudes; however, girls are typically disproportionately disadvantaged. An estimated 535million children live in countries experiencing conflicts, natural disasters and other humanitarian crises. Thenature and extent to which parents' endorsed gender norms affect the well-being of early adolescents living inprotracted humanitarian crises remains an understudied phenomenon though. The proposed dissertation studywill be guided by Blum et al.'s' Conceptual Framework for Early Adolescence and the Social Norms Approach,both adapted by the applicant to analyze parents' gender norms' effect on adolescent mental health, educationengagement, and nutrition. The purpose of this proposed mixed methods dissertation study is to examine therelationship between parent-endorsed gender norms and their early adolescents' mental health, educationengagement, and nutrition in the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. The specific aims of this studyare to: 1) examine how level of parental endorsement of equitable gender norms is associated withanxiety/depression, prosocial behavior, school attendance, and food security in early adolescence ; 2) examinehow adolescent gender moderates the association between parents' gender norms and adolescents'anxiety/depression, prosocial behavior, school attendance, and food security; and 3) explore adolescents'perceptions of how parents' endorsement of gender norms influence their mental health, educationalengagement, and nutrition. A comprehensive gender equality scale will be the primary quantitative measure ofparents' attitudes toward gender equality. This study is aligned with the National Institute of Child Health andHuman Development strategic priority of identifying the social, environmental, economic, and biological factorsthat influence early adolescent adaptive behavior development and school functioning, by understanding howparental gender norms impact the mental health, educational engagement, and nutrition of early adolescentsliving in a protracted humanitarian setting. This training plan will begin a program of research focused on thepromotion of the health and well-being of adolescents living in a post-conflict humanitarian setting. This studywill inform the development of culturally appropriate interventions to designed to help communities challengeinequitable gender norms and to replace them with norms that value gender equality.

The specific aims of this studyare to: 1) examine how level of parental endorsement of equitable gender norms is associated withanxiety/depression, prosocial behavior, school attendance, and food security in early adolescence ; 2) examinehow adolescent gender moderates the association between parents' gender norms and adolescents'anxiety/depression, prosocial behavior, school attendance, and food security; and 3) explore adolescents'perceptions of how parents' endorsement of gender norms influence their mental health, educationalengagement, and nutrition. A comprehensive gender equality scale will be the primary quantitative measure ofparents' attitudes toward gender equality. This study is aligned with the National Institute of Child Health andHuman Development strategic priority of identifying the social, environmental, economic, and biological factorsthat influence early adolescent adaptive behavior development and school functioning, by understanding howparental gender norms impact the mental health, educational engagement, and nutrition of early adolescentsliving in a protracted humanitarian setting. This training plan will begin a program of research focused on thepromotion of the health and well-being of adolescents living in a post-conflict humanitarian setting. This studywill inform the development of culturally appropriate interventions to designed to help communities challengeinequitable gender norms and to replace them with norms that value gender equality.

TI  - Potential of Mobile Technology to Relieve the Urgent Mental Health Needs in China: Web-Based Survey
T2  - JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: With the rapid development of information technology and mobile devices, an increasing number of mobile medical services and platforms have emerged. However, China's current mental health situation necessitates further discussion and research on how to provide more patient-centered services in the face of many challenges and opportunities.Objective: This study aims to explore the attitudes and preferences of mental health service stakeholders regarding mobile mental health services and discuss the challenges and opportunities faced by mobile technology developers in China.Methods: A web-based survey was conducted by following the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys (CHERRIES) checklist. A total of 586 valid questionnaires were collected. Respondents included 184 patients or their family members, 225 mental health professionals, and 177 people from the general population. Data analysis was completed using SPSS 24.0.Results: Among the various problems perceived regarding the current mental health medical environment, difficulty in finding appropriate psychologists and limited visit times ranked highest. Social media (n=380/586, 64.9%) was the most preferred platform among all participants, whereas professionals showed a higher preference for smartphone apps (n=169/225, 75.1%). Professional instruction, psychological consultation, and mental health education (ranked top 3) were the most commonly identified needs. Mental health professionals generally emphasized more on treatment-related mobile mental health service needs, especially medication reminders (chi(2)(2)=70.7; P<.001), symptom monitoring (chi(2)(2)=24.0; P<.001), and access to mental health resources (chi(2)(2)=38.6; P<.001). However, patients and their family members focused more on convenient web-based prescriptions (chi(2)(2)=7.7; P=.02), with the general population interested in web-based psychological consultation (chi(2)(2)=23.1; P<.001) and mental health knowledge (chi(2)(2)=9.1; P=.01). Almost half of the participants regarded mobile mental health services as highly acceptable or supported their use, but less than 30% of participants thought mobile mental health services might be very helpful. Concerns about mobile mental health mainly focused on information security. Service receivers also suspected the quality and professionalism of content, and mental health professionals were worried about time and energy consumption as well as medical safety.Conclusions: In terms of service flow, mobile services could be used to expand service time and improve efficiency before and after diagnosis. More individualized mobile mental health service content in more acceptable forms should be developed to meet the various needs of different mental health stakeholders. Multidisciplinary training and communication could be incorporated to facilitate the integration and cooperation of more well-rounded service teams. A standard medical record system and data format would better promote the development of future intelligent medical care. Issues such as ensuring service quality, solving safety risks, and better integrating mobile services with regular medical workflows also need to be addressed.

TI  - Comparison of the effects of IMRT and IMPT on MRI features of normal brain tissue: a retrospective study
T2  - BMC MEDICAL IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective This study aims to analyze magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) feature changes across different dose regions to investigate the differences in imaging feature alterations induced by Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) and Intensity-Modulated Proton Therapy (IMPT) in normal brain tissue. And evaluate the potential application value of radiomic features in dose optimization and biological dose assessment. Methods A retrospective analysis included 113 patients undergoing brain-target radiotherapy: 44 receiving IMPT (average total dose: 5713.63 +/- 774.32 cGy) and 69 receiving IMRT (average total dose: 5489.86 +/- 627.05 cGy). There was no significant difference in prescribed doses between groups (p < 0.05). MRI data were collected pre-treatment and one month post-treatment, including T1, enhanced T1, T2, T2-FLAIR, and ADC sequences. Images underwent preprocessing and rigid registration on the 3D Slicer platform. Dose regions (90%, 70%, 50%, 30% of the total dose) were segmented and classified into high (70-90%), medium (50-70%), and low (30-50%) dose regions as volumes of interest (VOI). Radiomic features were extracted from pre- and post-treatment MRI datasets, and Delta features were calculated as the difference between pre- and post-treatment data. Non-parametric tests, t-tests, and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to identify significant feature changes, with effect size analysis to compare the magnitude of changes. Multiple testing correction was applied to reduce false positives. Finally, box plots and the Mapping of Dose Distribution and Differences in Radiomics Feature Variation were utilized to visually illustrate the extent of brain tissue changes in each dose region following radiotherapy. Results Non-parametric tests indicated that more radiomic features exhibited significant changes in the IMRT group (p < 0.001). Effect size analysis also showed that the majority of features demonstrated greater and more pronounced changes within dose regions in the IMRT group (p < 0.05). Further correlation analysis revealed that most features (33/34) had weak correlations with dose-volume parameters (r < 0.3), suggesting that treatment modality itself may be the primary driver of these alterations rather than dose distribution alone. This finding highlights the need to refine traditional dose-based radiotherapy evaluation by incorporating biological effect considerations. Additionally, Moreover, the feature Delta_wavelet-HHL.65 exhibited the most significant change, with an effect size of -0.8 in the IMRT group. It demonstrated a moderate-to-high correlation with dose-volume parameters in the medium-to-high dose regions, with a maximum correlation coefficient of 0.65 (p < 0.001). This suggests that Delta_wavelet-HHL.65 may serve as a potential biomarker for reflecting local dose effects, contributing to the optimization of radiotherapy dose distribution. Conclusions This study revealed that IMRT and IMPT induce distinct radiomic feature changes under comparable dose conditions, and these differences are not solely determined by dose distribution. This suggests that radiotherapy evaluation should extend beyond physical dose metrics to incorporate biological effect dimensions. Furthermore, Delta_wavelet-HHL.65 demonstrated the most pronounced change in the IMRT group and exhibited correlations with dose-volume parameters in the low-to-medium dose regions, highlighting its potential for radiotherapy optimization.

TI  - Asset-based community development approaches to resilience among refugees and recent migrant communities in Australia: a scoping review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MIGRATION HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose - Resilience is an increasingly important concept that contributes to sustainability and wellbeing of a community. Asset-based community development (ABCD) may offer promising approaches to boosting community resilience in Australia, especially within marginalised groups.Design/methodology/approach - A scoping review was conducted to conceptualise existing literature on ABCD approaches to building resilience. Research databases were searched with relevant details.Findings - Thirty-three sources were identified as meeting the inclusion criteria and were reviewed in terms of six themes: integration and identity, health, mental health, education, employment and community planning. Issues identified by the literature within these themes can be alleviated through asset-based approaches. Implications for planning of asset-based programs and policy change are discussed in light of the findings.Practical implications - The results of this study provide several implications for practise, policy recommendations and future research into this area. Results suggest that increasing capacity around asset-based coping mechanisms, such as support networks through religious and cultural groups, would promote community development and foster resilience. Furthermore, policy on refugees in multiple areas, such as psychological service provision and employment, should be redesigned in a way that acknowledges their complex and diverse needs and facilitates their integration into the community. Though multiple ways to achieve this goal have been explored in literature, a sustained and broader approach is necessary to see widespread change. Further research and funding are required to explore and implement appropriate responses. Based on the findings and discussion above, the authors make the following policy recommendations. Service providers need to be aware of and incorporate culturally appropriate programs in the areas of mental health assessment and intervention, education and employment. The trauma-informed approach should be used when dealing with refugee groups and other groups who have faced hardships. Government policy should focus on improving community engagement to create and strengthen social networks, which are vital in boosting integration into the community and increasing health education and access to services. Government should focus on asset-based approaches in designing education and employment integration programs to promote social belonging and community engagement, and thus, community resilience, which will consequently have beneficial individual and group outcomes. The current governmental policy surrounding refugees should be overhauled with the goal of successful refugee integration in mind, such as incorporating the ability for refugees to access vital services such as employment and skills transferability programs. Due to current policy, these services are inaccessible to a large portion of refugees, hindering their integration. Government needs to create specific guidelines for the provision of psychological services to refugees to improve the quality of mental health services available to this group.Originality/value - This paper comprises an original data analysis of the relevant existing literature by the project team. The process was rigorous, and no content of the analysis has been published previously except the material published by other authors. All previously published materials were duly acknowledged.

TI  - RISE Study ("Resist, Intervene, Support, Empower"): Feasibility/Acceptability of MHealth Intervention targeting Transgender Women facing gender-based violence and mental health disorders in Brazil
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Transgender women (TGW) disproportionately experience physical/sexual violence when compared with thegeneral population and with other sexual and gender minorities (SGMs). A recent systematic review identified ahigh prevalence of lifetime physical (68%) or sexual violence (49%) among TGW. Frequent experiences ofviolence contributes to high levels of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder(GAD), suicidality, substance use disorder (SUD) and might influence the onset, progression, and prognosis ofmajor depressive disorder (MDD) among TGW. Since 2008 Brazil is responsible for more than 40% of alltransgender homicides reported worldwide. In 2016/17 we conducted a survey with 2,846 TGW from twelveBrazilian cities, identifying 60% prevalence of lifetime violence (physical and/or sexual), 60% of participantsscreened positive for MDD, 38% for GAD, and 35% attempted suicide. The majority of violent incidents werenot reported to the police (91%) and most victims did not receive any counseling or mental health (MH)treatment (82%). On this resubmission, we will utilize community-based participatory research (CBPR) to adaptthe “UNI-FORM” app and online platform (https://uni-form.eu) to TGW from Brazil. The study specific aims are:(1) Refine and adapt the “UNI-FORM” mHealth intervention to Brazil (RISE), including MH screening and linkto MH care; (2) Pilot test RISE to prevent violence, improve MH screening and treatment; and (3) Evaluate thefeasibility and acceptability of RISE. This R21 exploratory project proposes to recruit 200 TGW from Rio deJaneiro, Brazil to study the implementation of RISE. Consistent with NIMH goal to enhance research capacity,the proposal is led by an early stage investigator and includes a close collaboration with researchers fromDuke who will provide constant supervision from researchers with senior expertise in SGM mHealth (Dr.Legrand), SGM MH international research (Dr. Whetten), MH and implementation science (Dr. Belden). Thisproposal is innovative in several ways: it will adapt to Brazil an existing mHealth intervention addressingSGM-related violence (UNI-FORM), to include additional features to increase MH screening and linkage to MHcare. The proposed app, RISE, has the potential to improve crises response and promote timely MH careamong a high-risk population: TGW. It has significance and impact: The intervention will prevent and respondto violence against TGW, in a country with the highest rate of transgender murders in the world. It will alsodevelop an innovative strategy to identify and link to care TGW who need MH care, a population with highprevalence of PTSD, GAD, MDD, SUD and suicidality. Those mental disorders are underscreened,underdiagnosed, and undertreated among TGW. If successful, the intervention could be scaled up andadapted to other populations and countries. This research will yield the crucial first steps in developing a lowercost and efficacious mHealth intervention that we plan to evaluate with an RCT in a subsequent R01. RISEaddresses all three NIMH priorities identified in the Notice of Special Interest in Research on Health of SGMPopulations (NOT-MD-19-001), Grand Challenges in Global Mental Health and NIMH Strategic Aim 3.

M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - ABSTRACTSuicide is a leading contributor to global mortality and rates have remained steady, or increased, in low-resourced settings. Motherhood is both a protective and risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. In theperinatal period, women have increased risk for suicidal ideation and experience higher rates of violence andviolent death. Given rising suicide rates, the importance of the perinatal period for both mother and child, andgrowing dissemination of task-shifting programs to treat common mental disorders, there is critical and urgentneed to incorporate implementation strategies for suicide detection and referral within these programs. Whiletask-shifted mental health interventions have trained peer community members to successfully deliver lowintensity interventions where access to clinical care is limited, peers remain an untapped resource to providesuicide prevention support in settings where it is needed most. The goal of this award is to broaden thecandidate’s expertise to conduct independent clinical trials related to suicide prevention research focused onthe integration of community-delivered detection and response in low-resourced, high need, settings. Throughstructured mentorship from an expert team, coursework, workshop, and conference attendance, the candidatewill develop new competencies in suicide prevention research, including: (1) quantitative training in longitudinalanalysis for rare events (2) implementation science methods and research design to apply to suicideprevention interventions; and (3) clinical trial management skills, including ethical conduct of suicide preventionresearch in resource strained contexts, to become a NIH-funded independent investigator. Drs. DonnaSpiegelman, Joanna Maselko, Atif Rahman, Paul Pfeiffer, and Byron Powell (alongside a Pakistani advisorycommittee) will mentor and advise the candidate to meet these objectives. The proposed research will(1) examine the epidemiology and health impacts of recurrent suicidal ideation on mothers over time, (2)characterize key features of suicidal ideation and finalize intervention package components for the studycontext, and (3) conduct a pilot clinical trial to assess the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a SuicidePrevention Package (SuPP) within an existing task-shifted depression intervention. This K01 lays thegroundwork for a future R01 to scale a package for multi-level suicide prevention strategies that can beintegrated into community based mental health programs, particularly targeting individuals living in low-resourced settings. As the model is designed to be easily adapted and integrated, we anticipate the findingswill be valuable for all researchers looking to improve population health and mental health services indisadvantaged settings.

TI  - Managing patient mental health disclosures in Canadian dental and dental hygiene programs.
T2  - Canadian journal of dental hygiene : CJDH = Journal canadien de l'hygiene dentaire : JCHD
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective: This narrative literature review aims to explore the current landscape regarding the management of patient mental health disclosures and gaps in resources and protocols within Canadian dental and dental hygiene programs.Methods: CINAHL and Education Source databases, and the Journal of Dental Education were used to search for literature published between 2001 and 2023.Results: A total of 54 sources were included, primarily comprising original research articles, systematic and other literature reviews.Discussion: The prevalence of mental health disclosures is rising, with 1 in 5 Canadians living with a mental health condition. Current dental and dental hygiene programs lack explicit protocols for managing patient mental health disclosures, and the literature reveals a scarcity of research on students' preparedness. This review underscores the importance of adopting humanistic language to reduce stigma and emphasizes educational institutions' roles in evaluating and facilitating mental health services to support the mental health lived experiences of dental and dental hygiene patients.Conclusion: The review identifies 3 key research gaps: the absence of qualitative research on the student experience of managing patient disclosures, unclear integration of mental health education, and a scarcity of comprehensive evaluations of mental health services. Recommendations include incorporating mental health training in entry-to-practice curricula, aligning with established community support frameworks, and creating dedicated resources for the effective management of mental health disclosures for patients in educational settings.

TI  - Three-year course of clinical high-risk symptoms for psychosis in the community: a latent class analysis
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims Clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR-P) states exhibit diverse clinical presentations, prompting a shift towards broader outcome assessments beyond psychosis manifestation. To elucidate more uniform clinical profiles and their trajectories, we investigated CHR-P profiles in a community sample.Methods Participants (N = 829; baseline age: 16-40 years) comprised individuals from a Swiss community sample who were followed up over roughly 3 years. latent class analysis was applied to CHR-P symptom data at baseline and follow-up, and classes were examined for demographic and clinical differences, as well as stability over time.Results Similar three-class solutions were yielded for both time points. Class 1 was mainly characterized by subtle, subjectively experienced disturbances in mental processes, including thinking, speech and perception (basic symptoms [BSs]). Class 2 was characterized by subthreshold positive psychotic symptoms (i.e., mild delusions or hallucinations) indicative of an ultra-high risk for psychosis. Class 3, the largest group (comprising over 90% of participants), exhibited the lowest probability of experiencing any psychosis-related symptoms (CHR-P symptoms). Classes 1 and 2 included more participants with functional impairment and psychiatric morbidity. Class 3 participants had a low probability of having functional deficits or mental disorders at both time points, suggesting that Class 3 was the healthiest group and that their mental health and functioning remained stable throughout the study period. While 91% of Baseline Class 3 participants remained in their class over time, most Baseline Classes 1 (74%) and Class 2 (88%) participants moved to Follow-up Class 3.Conclusions Despite some temporal fluctuations, CHR-P symptoms within community samples cluster into distinct subgroups, reflecting varying levels of symptom severity and risk profiles. This clustering highlights the largely distinct nature of BSs and attenuated positive symptoms within the community. The association of Classes 1 and 2 with Axis-I disorders and functional deficits emphasizes the clinical significance of CHR-P symptoms. These findings highlight the need for personalized preventive measures targeting specific risk profiles in community-based populations.

TI  - Cell-type specific and activity-dependent characterization of non-coding autism de novo variants in human stem cell-derived neurons
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - PROJECT SUMMARYAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder with a complex geneticarchitecture. The development of effective therapeutics and diagnostic tools for ASD has been hindered by ourincomplete understanding of underlying genetic variation. De novo variants (DNVs), estimated to contribute to30-40% of cases, have been primarily studied in protein-coding regions of the genome. Hundreds of thousandsof non-coding variants have been identified but deciphering their functional contribution to ASD etiology remainschallenging. Cis-regulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers represent one avenue to assay thepotential impact of non-coding DNVs, but their regulatory activity is dependent on cellular contexts such as celltype and activation state. The two cell types primarily involved in ASD biology are excitatory (glutamatergic) andinhibitory (GABAergic) neurons, both of which can be generated in vitro from human pluripotent stem cells anddepolarized to model the transcriptomic and epigenetic changes caused by neuronal activation. Our labannotated the enhancers present in both cell types at baseline and activated states and found 2495 enhancerscontaining non-coding ASD DNVs, including several hundred that are cell-type specific or activity-dependent.Using a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA), this proposal will determine whether non-coding DNVs foundin individuals with autism alter cis-regulatory activity in glutamatergic or GABAergic human neurons in eitherbaseline or activated states. Further, gene-enhancer mapping has revealed that a subset of DNV-containingenhancers is predicted to regulate genes previously implicated in ASD. To validate cis-regulatory activity and tocompare trans-effects on downstream gene networks, a CRISPR inhibition screen will be performed in both celltypes and activation states, targeting 25 ASD genes and their DNV-containing enhancers. If successful, this workwill demonstrate the potential functional contribution of non-coding de novo variants to ASD biology, which hasthus far remained an outstanding question in the field. Moreover, this will generate transcriptomic datasets fortop ASD risk genes in two clinically relevant cell types at both resting and active states to expand upon thegrowing number of functional genomics ASD studies, emphasizing convergent regulatory gene networks. Thisresearch will take place at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, containing the 2nd best NIH-fundedneuroscience department and home to the Seaver Autism Center, renowned for bridging basic science andclinical trials for more effective ASD care. The scientific rigor, innovative techniques, sophisticated analyses,multi-disciplinary collaborations, and ample mentorship opportunities outlined here would propel me towards asuccessful career as an independent research professor studying the molecular mechanisms underlyingpsychiatric disorders while mentoring future generations of scientists and advocating for mental health education.

TI  - Validity and reliability of anxiety literacy (A-Lit) and its relationship with demographic variables in the Iranian general population
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Anxiety disorder is one of the most common mental disorders. This cross-sectional research aimed to determine anxiety literacy (A-Lit) psychometric properties among the Iranian population in 2022. Methods: This research was conducted on 690 people in Iran in 2022. In this study, people were selected by proportional stratified sampling, and the validity and reliability of the A-Lit designed by Griffiths were assessed. Validity of A-Lit was assessed by face validity, content validity, and confirmatory factor analysis. Reliability of A-Lit was evaluated by the McDonald's omega coefficient, Cronbach's alpha coefficient, and test- retest. In analytical sections, the tests of One-way ANOVA, Chi-squared test, and independent samples t-test were used. Results: The rates of S-CVI/Ave and CVR for A-Lit were 0.922 and 0.774, respectively. In confirmatory factor analysis, three items were deleted because the factor loading was less than 0.4, and goodness-of-fit indexes (Some of goodness-of-fit indexes: chi 2/df = 4.175, GFI: 0.909, RMSEA = 0.068, PCFI = 0.745, AGFI = 0.883) were confirmed as the final model with 19 items. For all items, the Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.832, the McDonald's omega coefficient was 0.835, and the intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.874. According to the results of this study, 1.3% (n = 9) did not answer any questions correctly and 8.4% (n = 58) were able to answer 1-6 questions correctly. Approximately 72% (n = 495) were able to answer 7-12 questions, and eventually only 18.6% (n = 128) were able to answer 13 questions and more. There was a significant relationship between sex, age group, occupation status, marital status, and get information related to mental illness with A-Lit level (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The Persian version of A-Lit was confirmed with 19 items, and this scale is a reliable tool for measuring A-Lit in the general population. The results also showed that a few people have a higher level of anxiety literacy and that educational and intervention programs need to be designed and implemented for the public population.

TI  - Improving maternal mental health in South East Asia through assets based approaches.
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Perinatal mental illness (mainly depression and anxiety during pregnancy and the first year after childbirth) is a major global health problem. Without the right kind of support and treatment, it can have long-term negative effects on the mother's and the child's health and wellbeing. Severe mental illness is one of the main causes of maternal deaths in the first year after childbirth and perinatal mental illness can negatively impact both the physical (low birth weight babies, reduced breast feeding, severe malnutrition and hampered growth), behavioural and social development of the infant, potentially creating a trans-generational cycle of poor mental and physical health. Perinatal mental illness disproportionately affects women who are already vulnerable, for example women exposed to violence, poor social support and low income. Although high quality information on LMICs is limited, it suggests that the occurrence of perinatal mental illness in LMIC may be three times higher than in high income countries. Therefore, effective and early treatment of perinatal mental illness is essential for the long-term welfare and wellbeing of populations in LMICs.  South East Asia comprises countries that are highly diverse in terms of ethnicity, language and culture and economic status, with several countries categorised as lower-middle and lowest income categories. In this region, perinatal mental illness is poorly understood and may be considered socially and culturally unacceptable with affected women and families experiencing stigma and blame. Further, there is inequity of access to skilled mental healthcare professionals, and lack of care guidance appropriate to perinatal mental health. This means that perinatal mental ill health is largely under recognised and under treated. We have established a South East Asian Perinatal Mental Health Research Network (SEAPMHRN) (currently involving members from Malaysia, Myanmar, Indonesia and Thailand) which includes researchers, clinicians, and a health Ministry in the region to develop a long-term research programme in perinatal mental health. This network has already conducted a 2-day workshop (Kuala Lumpur July 2019) to scope and establish research priorities as defined by the LMIC country participants. We aim to further expand and develop this network, bringing together multi-disciplinary experts (including NGOs and community workers) and lay people/women, to develop a context relevant research agenda for understanding and improving perinatal mental health. The research prioritisation workshop participants identified 3 key areas to address: understanding women's experiences of perinatal mental health problems, and preferences for care; improving screening and detection; and addressing the problem of low (perinatal) mental health literacy among professionals, and the public. This proposal is for funding to cover the following related activities:  1. To support further networking meetings, encouraging expansion of the current network to include more links to policy makers, NGOs, patient and public involvement and community development organisations, and the continuing development of research priorities; setting up appropriate communication structures e.g. website and exchange visits; supporting grant writing groups which build local research capacity.  2. Conduct foundation research for each of the 3 priority areas identified: To test the methods for digitally capturing a range of women's experiences or perinatal mental illness from across participating countries; to conduct a literature review on the validity of existing translated screening tools for detecting perinatal mental health problems in SE Asian women; to assess and adapt (if possible) existing resources for future delivery of perinatal mental health awareness training in the region.

TI  - Preparedness, Confidence, and Best Practices in Preventing, Recognizing, and Managing Mental Health Cases in National Collegiate Athletic Association Institutions
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATHLETIC TRAINING
M3  - Article
AB  - Context: Currently, the National Collegiate Athletic Associ-ation (NCAA) recommends written policies and procedures that outline steps to support student-athletes facing a mental health challenge and the referral processes for emergency and nonemergency mental health situations. Objective: To assess the mental health policies and proce-dures implemented and athletic trainers' perceived confidence in preventing, recognizing, and managing routine and crisis mental health cases across all 3 divisions of NCAA athletics. Design: Cross-sectional survey design and chart review. Setting: Online survey. Patients or Other Participants: Athletic trainers with clinical responsibility at NCAA member institutions (N = 1091, 21.5% response rate). Main Outcome Measure(s): Confidence in screening, preventive patient education, and recognizing and referring athletes with routine and emergency mental health conditions (5-point Likert scale: 1 = not at all confident, 2 = hardly confident, 3 = somewhat confident, 4 = fairly confident, 5 = very confident) using a content-validated survey (Cronbach a = 0.904) and mental health policy and procedure chart review. Results: Respondents indicated they felt fairly confident in screening (40.21%, n = 76 of 189) for risk of any mental healthcondition and fairly confident in implementing preventive patient education (42.11%, n = 80 of 190). They were fairly confident they could recognize (48.95%, n = 93 of 190) and refer (45.79%, n = 87 of 190) patients with routine mental health conditions. Participants were fairly confident they could recognize (46.84%, n = 89 of 190) but very confident (46.32%, n = 88 of 190) they could refer individuals with mental health emergencies. Policies lacked separate procedures for specific emergency mental health situations such as suicidal or homicidal ideation (36.1%), sexual assault (33.3%), substance abuse (19.4%), and confu-sional state (13.9%). Policies also lacked a plan for regular engagement of student-athletes in leadership roles (16.7%) and annual training of all student-athletes (16.7%). Conclusions: Although athletic trainers were generally confident in their ability to address emergency and routine mental health conditions, opportunities exist to improve policies for prevention, screening, and referral. Best-practice guidelines should be used as a guide to develop policies that foster an environment of mental health wellness.

TI  - The longitudinal association between school performance trajectories and offending behaviour
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Understanding risk and protective factors for offending and re-offending is a key research priority area for the Ministry of Justice. A thorough understanding of the circumstances driving offending behaviour is imperative for shaping public policy to reduce criminal activity, which will in turn have societal and economic benefits.   Developed in response to this priority area, this research project will use linked National Pupil Database (NPD) and Police National Computer (PNC) data to investigate school performance as a key predictor of offending behaviour. Low educational attainment is thought to be associated with increased risk of criminal behaviour. But little is known about changes in school performance throughout childhood and adolescence and whether consistently low or declining performance trajectories through school increase offending and re-offending risk. It is also unknown whether consistently high or improving performance through school might mitigate risk for offending among known vulnerable groups, such as those from deprived backgrounds, looked after children, and pupils with special educational needs.   In the proposed research project, I aim to identify subgroups of pupils who follow different school performance trajectories, and investigate their association with different types of offending and re-offending behaviours (such as violence, sexual offences, theft and robbery). I also aim to investigate whether high or increasing school performance trajectories mitigate risk for offending behaviour in vulnerable and marginalised groups, and whether there are regional differences in these relationships. I will achieve this using a longitudinal cohort of pupils born between 1990 and 1997, and using statistical modelling techniques that I have previously developed in NPD data.  Understanding this could inform early identification and prevention strategies for children showing early signs of following certain school performance trajectories, and demonstrate the importance of engaging vulnerable groups in education.  This project will also explore the linked NPD-PNC data resource and make recommendations to future users of the data. In particular, previous data linkages have shown that socio-demographic information is not always consistently recorded between administrative datasets. Therefore, in the course of this project, the NPD and PNC will be checked for discrepancies in gender and ethnicity recordings, and recommendations will be made for reconciling any discrepancies identified. The potential for the data resource to be used to conduct quasi-experimental trials, for example investigating whether special educational needs provision mitigates offending risk, will also be explored. This may lay the groundwork for subsequent advanced fellowship work.  Collaborations and outputs have been designed to maximise the impact of this project. I will consult with professional stakeholders, the Data First User Representation Panel and a local advisory group of young people at various points of project design and analysis. I will also host a stakeholder engagement event to build cross-sector collaborations, help interpret findings, and inform policy implications. Within the funding period, I will focus on producing user-friendly outputs and sharing any code I develop. I will also engage in networking, knowledge exchange, and relevant leadership and engagement training opportunities throughout the funding period.   I will be embedded in a team which has successfully linked NHS mental health records to the NPD, and is currently linking NHS mental health records to the PNC. I will therefore be positioned to use various data linkages for impactful research and, long-term, can extend the ADR UK Data First remit to include three-way data linkages between mental health, education and criminal justice records.

TI  - Developmental language disorder and neurodiversity: Surfacing contradictions, tensions and unanswered questions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE & COMMUNICATION DISORDERS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundNeurodiversity is increasingly discussed in relation to autism research and practice. However, there is a lack of scholarship concerning the neurodevelopmental condition of Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) and the neurodiversity movement. While this movement may hold opportunities for the DLD community, the application of the concept of neurodiversity to DLD research and practice needs consideration, as DLD and autism have very different levels of public and professional awareness and understanding.AimsIn this article, we discuss what the concept of neurodiversity and the associated neurodiversity movement could mean for DLD research and practice. We aim to critique some assumptions that may arise from the application of neurodiversity principles (or assumed principles) to the field of DLD.MethodsThis is a discussion paper, drawing on the personal experiences and reflections of the author team.Main ContributionsWe make the case for why DLD should be included in discussions about neurodivergence and outline considerations for doing so, and why some issues and applications may be particular to DLD. We outline points of similarity and contrast with autism in relation to our understanding of neurodiversity. We consider the issues around diagnosis and terminology and urge practitioners to continue to diagnose DLD using currently agreed terminology, so as not to undermine recent awareness efforts. We note that a neurodiversity-informed perspective challenges us to offer interventions that operate at the level of our environments, not just at the level of an individual. Indeed, neurodiversity offers a platform to argue for better rights and more inclusive spaces in mental health settings, education and work for children and adults with DLD.ConclusionsDLD should be considered from a neurodiversity-informed perspective, and it is our hope that this will lead to neurodiversity-affirming practice that will afford young people with DLD better understanding from members of the public and the professionals who work with them. Further work is needed to better support children, young people and adults with DLD to have a voice in the neurodiversity movement.

T2  - Zenodo
M3  - Software
AB  - Objectives:To investigate the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms among older adults in an urban district in China, as well as their associated factors. Participants: A total of 5,372 community-dwelling older adults aged 65 years or older were initially recruited. Ultimately, 5,331 participants met the inclusion criteria and were included in this study. Methods: Participants completed a sociodemographic questionnaire, along with assessments including the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Scale-7, UCLA Loneliness Simplification Scale, Insomnia Severity Index Scale, Community Dementia Brief Screening Scale, and the 8-item Dementia Screening Questionnaire. Statistical analyses included the Shapiro‒Wilk test, independent t-test, Wilcoxon rank test, c2 test, and univariate and multivariate linear regression analysis. Results: The prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms among older adults in Shenzhen communities was 10.4% and 11.3%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, age (B=-0.01, P Funding provided by: Shenzhen Science and Technology Research and Development Fund for Sustainable Development*Crossref Funder Registry ID: Award Number: KCXFZ20201221173613036 Study population This study employed a cross-sectional population-based survey research design and used a multistage random whole-group sampling method to select representative samples from 10 districts in Shenzhen. First, we conducted sampling by region and population distribution based on Shenzhen's 2018 population statistics. One street was randomly selected from each administrative district, and one community was further randomly selected from each street in the first stage. In the second phase, all eligible households were drawn from each of the selected communities. In the final phase, we selected eligible family members from each of the designated families and recruited participants from the selected families from April 2017 to October 2017. To be eligible, participants had to meet the following criteria: (1) aged 65 or above; (2) residing in Shenzhen for at least 6 months; and (3) providing informed consent. Participants were excluded if they refused to sign the informed consent form after repeated explanations by the investigator, could not be located on at least three return visits, or had a history of a serious medical condition that might prevent them from completing the survey. From October 2020 to February 2021, a total of 5,372 participants were invited to participate in the study and were asked to complete a mental health assessment questionnaire. Of these, 41 participants were excluded due to poor questionnaire completion quality, leaving 5,331 participants (99.2%) for data analysis. All eligible participants received mental health education, and those with abnormal assessment results were referred to the nearest mental health care facility for counselling and medical care. Before the formal survey began, the research team recruited investigators who were experienced in mental health work and provided them with structured training sessions. The training covered the purpose of this study, community outreach strategies, proper questionnaire administration, and the importance of standardized assessments and research procedures. Investigators utilized various means such as posters, radio broadcasts, and media channels, to promote mental health surveys in the sampled communities and to gain the understanding, attention, and cooperation of the community. Investigators then made individual appointments according to the sample list, explained the purpose of the survey, the process, and the benefits of participation to the respondents, and obtained consent. A specific time for the face-to-face household survey was then determined. As mental health-related issues are sensitive information, we asked all participants to complete the survey in a private one-on-one setting. Measurements A structured questionnaire was utilized to gather information on the participants' sociodemographic characteristics and health assessment parameters. The questionnaire required approximately 25 minutes to complete and consisted of four sections, which included sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle, physical health, and mental health. whether the participants suffer from chronic diseases, is based on the diagnosis of chronic disease by second level and above hospitals. Additionally, a comprehensive self-reported assessment of the participants' health status in the past year was used, with five ratings ranging from good to poor. Drinking behaviour was categorized into three groups: drinkers (1 or more drinks per week), previous drinkers who currently abstain from alcohol, and nondrinkers. Smoking behaviour was classified into three categories: smokers, individuals with a previous history of smoking who currently abstain, and never smokers. The Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale-9 item (PHQ-9) was utilized to evaluate the occurrence of depressive symptoms in the participants. The PHQ-9 comprises nine items that measure the respondent's depressive state and severity in the past year, with each item rated on a four-point scale from 0 (not at all) to 3 (almost every day). The total score ranges from 0-27, with higher scores indicating more severe depression. In this study, we used a score of 5 as the cut-off point, with a score greater than or equal to 5 indicating the presence of depressive symptoms and a score less than 5 indicating the absence of depressive symptoms. The Cronbach's alpha for the scale was 0.805. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7) was utilized to assess the occurrence of anxiety symptoms in the participants. Respondents recall their anxiety status and severity assessment within the past year, rating each item on a four-point scale from 0 (not at all) to 3 (almost every day), with a total score range of 0-21. Higher scores indicate more severe anxiety in participants. For this study, a score of 5 was used as the threshold, with scores greater than or equal to 5 indicating the presence of anxiety symptoms and scores less than 5 indicating the absence of anxiety symptoms. The Cronbach's alpha for the scale was 0.911. A simplified version of the UCLA Loneliness Scale (ULS-6) was utilized to evaluate the discrepancy between the respondents' desire for social interaction and their actual level of interaction. The ULS-6 was translated and revised in Chinese and comprises six items, each rated on a four-point scale from 1 (never) to 4 (always). The total score ranges from 6 to 24, with higher scores indicating more severe loneliness. The Cronbach's alpha for the scale was 0.870. The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) was utilized to evaluate the occurrence and severity of insomnia in the participants, consisting of seven items. Respondents are asked to recall their insomnia symptoms in the past month. Each item is rated on a four-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (almost every day). The total score ranges from 0-21, with higher scores indicating more severe insomnia symptoms. In this study, a score of 7 was chosen as the threshold, with scores greater than or equal to 7 indicating the presence of insomnia symptoms and scores less than 7 indicating the absence of insomnia symptoms. The Cronbach's alpha for the scale was 0.929. The Brief Community Screening Instrument for Dementia (CSI-D) was utilized to assess the presence of early dementia among the participants. The scale includes seven cognitive items, which are ranked in descending order of difficulty as follows: describing the purpose of a hammer, naming the elbow, pointing to the window and then to the door, identifying the location of a nearby shop, identifying the current season, identifying the current week, and recalling three words after a delay. The total score on the scale ranges from 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating better cognitive functioning. In this study, a score of 7 was used as the threshold for early dementia, with scores greater than 7 indicating no evidence of early dementia and scores less than or equal to 7 indicating the presence of early dementia. The Cronbach's alpha for the scale was 0.674. The 8-item Ascertain Dementia Questionnaire (AD8) was utilized to assess early mild cognitive impairment (MCI) on an eight-item scale. These items include diminished assertiveness, reduced engagement in hobbies, repetition of the same thing, difficulty in learning new things, forgetting the current year, difficulty handling complex financial matters, difficulty recalling appointments with others, and problems with memory and thinking. The total score ranges from 0 to 8, with higher scores indicating more severe cognitive impairment. In this study, a score of 2 was used as the nodal point, with scores greater than or equal to 2 indicating possible mild cognitive impairment and scores less than 2 indicating normal cognitive functioning. The Cronbach's alpha for this scale was 0.796. Statistical analysis The statistical analysis was conducted using R version 4.1.0. Means and standard deviations are used to describe continuous variables, while frequencies and percentages are used for categorical variables. The Shapiro‒Wilk test was used to check the normality of continuous variables. The Shapiro‒Wilk test was used to check the normality of continuous variables. Student's independent t-test or Wilcoxon's rank test was used to compare quantitative variables, depending on the normal distribution test results. The chi-square test was used for categorical variables. The R package "compareGroups" was utilized for descriptive analysis. Dummy variables were created for categorical variables, and the first reference group for each variable was set as the reference group for regression analysis. One-way linear regression was used to identify the factors associated with depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms. The variables that were statistically significant in the univariate analysis were included in a multifactorial stepwise linear regression model to evaluate the relationship between depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms. The analyses were performed using the R packages "car" and "MASS". The test level was set to a two-sided alpha of 0.05, and a P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

AB  - Objectives:To investigate the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms among older adults in an urban district in China, as well as their associated factors. Participants: A total of 5,372 community-dwelling older adults aged 65 years or older were initially recruited. Ultimately, 5,331 participants met the inclusion criteria and were included in this study. Methods: Participants completed a sociodemographic questionnaire, along with assessments including the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Scale-7, UCLA Loneliness Simplification Scale, Insomnia Severity Index Scale, Community Dementia Brief Screening Scale, and the 8-item Dementia Screening Questionnaire. Statistical analyses included the Shapiro‒Wilk test, independent t-test, Wilcoxon rank test, c2 test, and univariate and multivariate linear regression analysis. Results: The prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms among older adults in Shenzhen communities was 10.4% and 11.3%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, age (B=-0.01, P Funding provided by: Shenzhen Science and Technology Research and Development Fund for Sustainable Development*Crossref Funder Registry ID: Award Number: KCXFZ20201221173613036 Study population This study employed a cross-sectional population-based survey research design and used a multistage random whole-group sampling method to select representative samples from 10 districts in Shenzhen. First, we conducted sampling by region and population distribution based on Shenzhen's 2018 population statistics. One street was randomly selected from each administrative district, and one community was further randomly selected from each street in the first stage. In the second phase, all eligible households were drawn from each of the selected communities. In the final phase, we selected eligible family members from each of the designated families and recruited participants from the selected families from April 2017 to October 2017. To be eligible, participants had to meet the following criteria: (1) aged 65 or above; (2) residing in Shenzhen for at least 6 months; and (3) providing informed consent. Participants were excluded if they refused to sign the informed consent form after repeated explanations by the investigator, could not be located on at least three return visits, or had a history of a serious medical condition that might prevent them from completing the survey. From October 2020 to February 2021, a total of 5,372 participants were invited to participate in the study and were asked to complete a mental health assessment questionnaire. Of these, 41 participants were excluded due to poor questionnaire completion quality, leaving 5,331 participants (99.2%) for data analysis. All eligible participants received mental health education, and those with abnormal assessment results were referred to the nearest mental health care facility for counselling and medical care. Before the formal survey began, the research team recruited investigators who were experienced in mental health work and provided them with structured training sessions. The training covered the purpose of this study, community outreach strategies, proper questionnaire administration, and the importance of standardized assessments and research procedures. Investigators utilized various means such as posters, radio broadcasts, and media channels, to promote mental health surveys in the sampled communities and to gain the understanding, attention, and cooperation of the community. Investigators then made individual appointments according to the sample list, explained the purpose of the survey, the process, and the benefits of participation to the respondents, and obtained consent. A specific time for the face-to-face household survey was then determined. As mental health-related issues are sensitive information, we asked all participants to complete the survey in a private one-on-one setting. Measurements A structured questionnaire was utilized to gather information on the participants' sociodemographic characteristics and health assessment parameters. The questionnaire required approximately 25 minutes to complete and consisted of four sections, which included sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle, physical health, and mental health. whether the participants suffer from chronic diseases, is based on the diagnosis of chronic disease by second level and above hospitals. Additionally, a comprehensive self-reported assessment of the participants' health status in the past year was used, with five ratings ranging from good to poor. Drinking behaviour was categorized into three groups: drinkers (1 or more drinks per week), previous drinkers who currently abstain from alcohol, and nondrinkers. Smoking behaviour was classified into three categories: smokers, individuals with a previous history of smoking who currently abstain, and never smokers. The Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale-9 item (PHQ-9) was utilized to evaluate the occurrence of depressive symptoms in the participants. The PHQ-9 comprises nine items that measure the respondent's depressive state and severity in the past year, with each item rated on a four-point scale from 0 (not at all) to 3 (almost every day). The total score ranges from 0-27, with higher scores indicating more severe depression. In this study, we used a score of 5 as the cut-off point, with a score greater than or equal to 5 indicating the presence of depressive symptoms and a score less than 5 indicating the absence of depressive symptoms. The Cronbach's alpha for the scale was 0.805. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7) was utilized to assess the occurrence of anxiety symptoms in the participants.
